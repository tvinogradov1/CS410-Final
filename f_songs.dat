# hey. lumpa sugar, you look kinda sweet

# when i look into your eyes, i wanna leap
# i can't conceal that you make me feel
# like a tiger, ooh, ooh, ooh, like a tiger
# ooh, ooh, ooh, just to see you smile nearly drives me wild
# i wanna growl    wow
# i'm feelin' stronger than a grizzly bear
# soarin' like an eagle flyin' through the air
# when i get you in my arms, you'd better beware
# i go insane 'cause i can't be tamed
# like a tiger, ooh, ooh, ooh, like a tiger
# ooh, ooh, ooh, just to see you smile nearly drives me wild
# i wanna growl    wow

# you keep my heart jumpin' like a kangaroo
# floatin' like an onion in a bowl of stew
# baby, ev'ry time you come in view
# i run like an antelope to get to you
# i'm your tiger and you're my mate
# hurry up, buttercup, and don't be late
# i might get mad if i have to wait

# Fab...
# Can you be my B-A-B-Y?
# I'll never call another lover mine
# [Verse 1: Fabolous]
# And why would I, and why should I
# When I seen a lady tonight, with my good eye that I would try and make
# My..(baby..baby)
# I was up in the club putting my hood high
# When I saw you, and I stood by
# Just lookin at your onion girl I could cry, and I could lie
# I mean I could try and say you ain't sweep me off my feet
# But only one thing could keep me off the street
# And that's if you be my, B-A-B-Y
# I can be why you always be fly
# And I'm from B-Stuy, just like B.I...G. was, that's how F-A-B does
# We can sip something 'til we both be buzzed
# In a V-dub and that's only be-cause
# [Chorus: Mike Shorey]
# Need someone to be my (baby)
# Kind of girl you find in the club rockin those (baby) Phat jeans
# Gonna find someone to be my (baby)
# ..I see some ladies tonight that should be having my (baby, baby)
# [Verse 2: Fab]
# After the baby talk, the goo goo ga ga
# You like this, that, you do bla bla
# Couple good jokes, a few brouhaha's, it's time to do you mama
# First I'ma put you on your back
# And make you scream out (baby)..just like I put you on the track
# Then I'ma lay you on your side
# And slowly stroke you while you telling me the way you feel inside
# But my sex drive won't make me play you on the side
# You know you get the keys any day you wanna ride
# And my baby know how to start me up
# You got the kind of kiss that'll speed a heartbeat up
# And you got the kind of touch that'll gimme the chills
# I ask you cuz I know you gonna gimme it real
# It won't be fake, and don't we make a good couple
# And won't we make a good...(baby)?
# [Bridge: Mike Shorey]
# Ooh, if I seem just a bit taken, pardon me
# But you're so amazing
# I just want us to do this exclusively
# Say you'll be my baby
# [Verse 3: Fab]
# My baby's the only one I bring to the villa
# That can get the bling and the scrilla
# Girl, I know you smooth enough to spring a chinchilla
# And still take a sting of Tequila, the way you swing is a thriller
# I'm watchin that like the boxing match in the ring of Manila
# I wanna keep it comin like the singles of 'Thriller'
# I mean if you still uh..my B-A-B-Y

# [Hook I]
# Yo these niggaz can't breathe when I come through, hum too
# Some shoes, gotta be 20 man
# It's not even funny they can't BREATHE
# The choke holds too tight
# The left looks too right
# You know what? You right
# These bitches can't BREATHE
# (Hook II)
# Look look, they hearts racin'
# They start chasin'
# But I'm so fast when I blow past
# That they can't BREATHE
# In the presence of the man
# Your future looks better than ya past if you present with the man
# You betta BREATHE
# You niggaz can't share my air
# Or walk a mile in the pair I wear
# And I'm gettin better year by year
# Like they say Juan do
# Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the canines through
# And I pace myself
# I know these money hungry bitches wanna taste my wealth
# But I keep em' on a diet
# Embrace they health
# Or either keep em' on a quiet
# And space myself
# And just take a deep breath
# I got em' grabbin' they chest
# Cuz it's hurtin' em' to see Fab in his best
# And they in they worst
# They rather see me lay in the hearse than lay in the back
# And I ain't just layin a verse
# I'm sayin the facts
# I came back with some sicka stones
# That got these broke niggaz lookin at me like they chokin' on a chicken bone
# Every chick I bone
# Can't leave the dick alone
# So I know
# It's one of them everytime I flip my phone
# [HOOK I]
# [HOOK II]
# I see em on the block when I passes
# Lookin like they need oxygen mask-es
# I make it hard to BREATHE
# But I keep the glocks in the stashes
# Cuz the cops wanna lock and harass us
# And make it hard to BREATHE
# They has to react
# Like havin' a asthma attack
# When they see the plasma in back
# You dudes are wheezin' behind me
# My flow is like a coupe, breezin at 90
# That's the reason they signed me
# It's quick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts
# Feels somethin' like hard punches to the gut
# How I address the haters and under estimaters
# And ride up on them like they escalators
# They shook up and hooked up to respirators
# On they last breath talking to investigators
# I'm a breath of fresh air
# And a fresh pair
# Face it boo and do it till your face get blue
# And then BREATHE
# [HOOK I]
# [HOOK II]
# When the crew walk in it
# Pop a few corks in it
# As quick as a tick in a New York minute
# Catch a breath, fore u catch a left
# Even worse, catch a Tef
# Only way u catch a F
# To the A-B, its in the maybe
# Rollin with my baby
# Grippin on a toy that you won't find in +KayBee+
# I rhyme slick on ya
# I'm a have to put the Heimlich on ya
# What you know bout lettin' dimes lick on ya?
# While you inhale the weed
# And it won't stop till they inhale ya seed
# And it don't stop I tell em' to breathe
# Like a doctor with a stethoscope
# I don't see no fuckin hope
# Unless these motherfuckers BREATHE
# Yeah, Brooklyn gotta
# Uptown gotta
# the Bronx gotta
# Queens gotta
# Staten Isle gotta
# You niggas gotta
# You bitches gotta
# Everybody BREATHE

# Cuz now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
# I can still picture, when I was wit cha like you was never gone
# I remember the good times, all of the bad times
# I dedicate this song, to my niggaz laid out, Til my niggaz lay down
# Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me
# Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
# Quick to holla at a bitch with the same lines
# Quick to draw on a nigga with the same nines
# But at the same time we was on some diffrent shit
# Cuz you was with a bitch that I beg to differ wit
# I told you sniff a bit and you could get a whif of it
# But you kept a closed nose when it came to those hoes
# And Im your nigga so I tried to smell em wrong for ya
# Wasn't there to take the fault for ya, But if you hear me
# I dedicate this song for ya, He was setup in a stick up
# By a girl he used to pick up on the upper west side
# I used to help him chop a brick up, They found him in his pickup
# Pants down and dick up, Leanin with one in his head
# And one in his chest, One of the best at this husslin' shit
# But his downfall was that he put his trust in a bitch and it's fucked up
# I remember selling three bricks of raw powder
# Turn my man into a star in 24 hours
# He didn't care spent the money in like 4 hours
# on a Benz with like 400 and Horsepower
# And a chain that had christ on it, a rollie with alot of Ice on it
# A pinky ring with a price on it, when he come around
# Its likely that he blunted
# With a pretty lady in them Nikes that you wanted
# It's well know he kept it on his hip like a cell phone
# If you speak with him you can pick up on his jail tone
# He used to say he wasn't going back without blowing back
# and now I'm black I wouldn't put it past him
# The D's would Harass him, til he finally blacked out
# They told my nigga to freeze, but he still backed out
# Shots fired 'til his trigger finger got tired
# All the newspapers said was 'Another Nigga Dead'
# And it's fucked up
# You can catch me in a cherry red 8-50 nice ass
# great titties, face pretty everybody know that she date smitty
# A big time dealer thats doing a state biddin
# who did more than his share of dirt in the world
# enough to make a nigga think about hurtin' his girl
# so he used to tell his queen to stay to the castle
# away from the hassle to the day that he pass through
# There's some enemies he might have who may wanna blast you
# She stayed for a few years, that's until a few pairs
# convinced her to come and hang out around New Year's
# It's been awhile, you can see it in her smile
# and she ran into her man's Co-Defendant in the trial
# who started going on about how he moving on
# about running with them same niggaz Smitty had warned about
# She slid off told her girl, she had to drop her kid off
# They found her in the parking lot, somebody blew her lid off
# and it's fucked up

# So I won't stop, and I don't stop, yeah

# I'm hearin' muh'fucka's tryin'a steal my flow
# But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga J.O
# Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'
# Now I done been so many places and seen so many faces
# But none of these motherfuckers do it like me
# Don't no motherfuckin' click do it like we
# Guess I'm doin' the right thing like Spike Lee
# See they talk like they some ho's, I walk like I'm supposed
# But if they get in the way they get stepped on
# It's the hundred-thou with the bling kept on
# Dippin' on my semi-automatic weap-on

# I got a coupe that I'm finna' put some miles on
# And I ride on these niggaz wit a smile on
# See I'm 'bout stackin' money but when they start actin' funny
# I fall back and all a man do is laugh
# I'm the kinda player that ain't gotta do the draft
# Buncha hits, couple plaques nigga do the math
# But a nigga must be gone for gettin' his hustle on

# This nation thrives off misery niggas
# So if you ain't trying to let your hard times increase your wealth
# Niggas keep that progressive sh** to yourself
# This is the business of buying souls, and we only tryin' to f*** with those who trying to sell them
# See, they may see me as an adversary cuz they know I'm tryin' to tell them
# About the forest of artists who grow only to meet industry axes
# How they take niggas dreams and write then off in their taxes
# Contracts is confusing, but don't worry they'll appoint you a lawyer for you w**** you
# Loan you funds to f*** your soul make you pay it back and still maintain control of your stroll
# Your tracks and your hot ass slow flow
# They'll keep you looking good and all that, but no dough
# You see when that get a bi***, they got a bi***
# And contrary to popular opinion it ain't my sistas that switch
# It's my brothers
# We the dumb motherf***ers
# Hardest niggas in the streets turned industry suckers
# Cuz we refused to do the knowledge
# Nigga, you can't learn this music game in the streets or in college
# So you betta pick up a book or something
# Or f*** it, FAB will put it in a hook or something

# For the hustlers, for the customers, trust the buzz
# It's have you makin' one of the sounds that Busta does (woo HAH!)
# They love me just because
# I'm in the gallardo, laughing like Ricky Ricardo (Ha ha ha ha)
# With the 4-pounder, pretty gangsta nigga
# I'm the co-founder, I know the difference between pimps and hoe-hounders
# I can tell when they ain't learn to lean
# They gold cups missing stones, turning green
# I roll up wrist in chrome, burning green like what's good
# [Verse Two]
# God was in a good mood, on the day he made me
# I'm from the projects, it's the way it made me
# And I wouldn't change it for nothing
# I stay on point, that's 'cuz I know the danger of stuntin'
# But the aim is like I'll be at the ranges or somethin'
# It takes a gangsta, to know a gangsta
# That's why we look at you like a stranger or somethin'
# 'Cuz we can tell by the body language you frontin'
# And it take a little more than lettin' ya pants sag
# Ya sand bag, tryna jump on the band wag
# I'll put the red dot on you like a Japan flag
# You need some high heels and a handbag
# [Verse Three]
# I'm in the ten minutes to nine, leanin' on 'em
# Like I'm ten minutes behind, fuck a hundred shots
# Give me a .40 cal wit' ten in it, I'm fine
# Just spray, and shit'll get you ten minute of shine
# Keep a friend in it, that's ten cented for mine
# Keep the rims in it, that spin in it for mine
# Can't see him in it, I been tinted up mine
# But you know a nigga look oh so gangsta
# Oh no thank ya, I earned my key
# My name'll get you fucked up, and burners tee
# That's gangsta love, from the heart
# Yo I told y'all from the start
# And now (y'all know whoooooooo)
# Keep it G'd up, I can't slow down, these creep's speed up
# Cali bringin' peeps and weed up
# I'm coming through with a bunch of girls that'll deep a seed up
# (It's a gangsta party)

# And know who I be! uh!
# [Verse - Fabolous]
# I got the Yankee leaning, just sittin over to browse
# And the G4 is just getting over the clouds
# You can't tell me that I ain't what's up right now
# I got a bottle of Tequila upside down
# There's some chicks wit boyfriends that are up tight now
# Cause they know the big 'dog' had a 'pups' like wow
# I'm stuck in my city ways
# Heading over seas wit a zip of New York City's haze
# You rats can keep running through your city's maze
# Until you get sprayed with the pesticide
# I know you in that hole, you best to hide
# Like the rest who tried, who went and testified
# Of course your girl wanna slide over and be rubbed
# And don't mind taking rides over the G dubs
# I ride Rovers on Spre-dubs
# Please don't be another dude who died over a ski dub, chill
# [Chorus - Fabolous & (Thara)]
# From hood to hood they see what's hood and know who I be
# From block to block they see it, not can't know who I be
# From state to state they cannot hate, they know who I be
# From the east to west, through the midwest and downsouth it's Ghetto!
# (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto! (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto!
# (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto! (It's Ghetto-ohh!) It's Ghetto!

# I get it jumping like a lo lo '64
# And bet they hop on it like a pogo stick pro
# I'm chilling wit these go go chicks though
# That do the kind of things that belong in a porno flick yo
# You know it's him and the gang
# Wit the bling worked on, that remind you of lemon meringue
# But remember the thangs, ain't too far
# And y'all wanna hear em go bang bang bang
# Like John Witherspoon, I'm watching em closely
# I know the snakes gon' slither soon
# The two toned Maybach's getting delivered soon
# The back feels like sitting in the living room
# I'm so hard bodied like the suit on Batman
# It's that man that back to back plat' scan
# I'm back for the third time, I make words rhyme for a living
# You probably heard I'm still ghetto, nigga!
# [Verse - Fabolous]
# They tried to put two 9's on me, just like Gretzky
# But my lawyer saw through it just like wet tees
# I smoke till my eyes look just like Jet Li's
# On islands where the water's blue just like Pepsi
# Yeah the trigger just might get squeezed
# And the slugs will skip over your waves, just like jet skis
# Hoes know Ghetto from New York, call em the Fresh Prince
# And throw rose petals when I walk
# They love how I came back hard like good blow
# And I'm still a heart throb to a hood ho
# That's what hood though, yes I would know
# That's cause I'm in the streets like man hole covers
# Rims look like blades when a fan blow brother
# I'm waiting on a storm to land, roast others
# The man no other, cause I been in it
# My time is money, y'all couldn't buy ten minutes
# I'm gone! catch up!

# [Lil' Mo]
# You are now tuned in to WFAB radio
# Yo. Baby Girl where you at?
# [Lil' Mo]
# Right here, Right here, Right here baby, uh, here's another one
# You need to holla at somebody real, such as myself
# Won't nobody do as much as myself
# And it's so real, I hop out and get the Duchess myself
# For a pretty girl such as yourself
# Cuz I'm a busy man and don't see too much for myself
# and sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself
# But I, make the time when I have to
# Learn to take my time and be careful when dealin'
# With women there's some who be wheelin' and schemin'
# And dive in to relationships cuz I got a million to swim in
# They'll throw it to you faster than Schilling and Clemens
# But feelings ain't the only thing that you can catch now
# Some do lawyers that you hopin' ?they fed styles?
# Others pass diseases that you could catch now
# But in my minutes alone I think about this crazy world
# And don't wanna live in it alone cuz
# [Chorus: Lil' Mo]
# I'll give you all my love and you can always trust
# my loyalty, honesty and security
# I'll never leave can't none of these other chicks
# (fuck) with me so holla at somebody real
# Cause I'm so real
# I'm searchin' for real love like J. Blige in '92
# But I pray I would find you
# They say weather the storm and leave the gray skies behind you
# The fake may try to blind you
# That's why I stay fly like I do
# And no I can't trust everybody that I say "Hi" and "Bye" to
# First I need a girl that may die as my boo
# Then I may try the "I Do's", but I refuse
# to be tricked or used by a chick
# who get amusement and kicks out abusing my dick
# When it's real I'm all in it
# But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it
# Before it didn't matter who
# Now I look for some with a little attitude
# I could chill to chatter to, good looking but witty and compatible
# Long hair with a fatty too, and that'll do
# [Hook: Lil' Mo]
# No I'm not trying to pressure you
# But my loves too incredible, far too great, (right in front of your face)
# And I'll give you something you can feel
# To let you know that I really need somebody real
# I need to holla at somebody real, could that be you
# The feelings that I feel, could that be true
# Most cats lay where the hood rats beat boo
# But I'm the kinda cat that strays away
# That's till somebody real sways my way
# Then I might spend some days away, on an Asia Bay
# Eatin' food made the Cajun way, and sippin' a little sake
# Boilin' a little broccoli
# But this world is full of floozies that bullshit usually
# I pull them choosy
# Cuz on this joint, and at this point
# I know I have to holla at somebody real, for real
# - repeat to fade

# When you grow up in my hood
# Help don't show up in my hood
# Gang signs go up in my hood, just cuz you in..my..hood
# Feel like I'm trapped in my hood
# Young kids get clapped in my hood
# That's why I'm strapped in my hood, just cuz you in..my..hood
# In..my..hood, in my hood, in my hood
# [Verse 1: Fabolous]
# I'm always close to..
# feeling like a corner stander, stoop sitter, or hallway post-er
# No matter where I go it's always 'posed to, feel just like I'm (in my hood)
# Cops drive in it every 5 minutes, look at your faces, pat your waists'
# Try to find the stash where the gats and base is, I can't say that they racist
# But I know.. it ain't the same in they town
# And as fucked up as it may sound (in my hood)
# it's 2 ways to make it happen off the streets
# Balling on the courts or rapping off the beats
# You hear the shells tappin' off the 'crete, when they clappin' off the heat
# Then the yellow tape's trappin off the street
# But that's the way we was raised
# Preying to God, hoping that he keep us out the way of them strays
# [Verse 2: Fabolous]
# They drink 'til the cups dry, eat 'til the plate's clean
# Niggaz be in state greens 'fore they turn 18
# 'Round here you never let the beef slide twice
# Everybody raised on 4 wings and beef fried rice
# Them mothers are getting younger today
# Got one by the hand, one in the stroller and one on the way
# We don't have role models
# But we got them handguns that hold hollows (in my hood)
# Ain't no diplomas or degrees
# but you can get high from the aroma of the trees (in my hood)
# I know it like navigation, and fuck having patience
# I'ma get mine, you better get yours, cuz everyday is a struggle
# And One-Time ride through everyday just to bug you
# That's how it is, cuz your rights be wrong
# And everybody got a white T on, when you're in..my..hood
# [Verse 3: Fab]
# We try to make the most of what we got
# You either been hit, or been close to gettin shot (in my hood)
# Any nigga that boast be getting got
# And dopeheads fiend to get a dose of what we got
# and young niggaz be like they slow
# But you give them a blunt..bet they roll the weed like a pro
# If you trick it's not a problem it gets you laid
# But if you stick without a condom, it gets you AIDS
# No Sesame Street, kids watch BET
# Look up to niggaz that don't got a GED
# I know a dude with the deadbeat tag
# kids don't got diapers but he ridin' in the red G-Wag'
# In the hood, you and your beef is sure to bump heads
# and everybody grew up sleepin on bunk beds
# They telling me to vote..and I would
# If it made a change in my hood..mu'fucka.

# Now when I spray wit the sauer, I gotta spend a day wit the lawyer

# Or get a red dot on you, like a 7Up can
# Some of y'all caught feelings from way back
# Others waited till I came through, short willing the Maybach
# But I'm still bucking like, five, duce, four, trey
# Still tucking and letting the fo' spray
# Still ducking where ever the po's lay
# And still f***ing, and making them hoes say, WHOA!
# ...And I know Fed's seen
# The old school Chevy, with the dope head lean
# Y'all love the way I R-I-D-E

# [Intro- Fabolous and Cop]
# Alright there ah buddy license and registration
# Uh officer is there a problem man whats going on?
# Yeah, I had a report of a UFO
# whats that?
# An unidentified Ferrari looking object flying by me on the highway
# you know how fast you were going?
# nah not at all man
# you must have been going pretty damn fast because my radar is over there smoking buddy
# keep your hands where I can f***ing see 'em too
# I heard about you in the paper, I know you got the toaster strudel
# yeah I need some backup over here I've got two rap singers
# I wonder briefly
# Could it be there's no roof above me
# or the 22's underneath me
# Thats keepin them sirens flashin on my ass
# Should I get to pumpin the brakes or mashin on the gas?
# I'm naturally harassed
# And I feel like I'm getting punked... but I don't see Ashton in the grass
# Nor is there a camera stashed into the dash
# It's a guy in a uniform and a passion that he has
# For flashin wit his badge
# And shining light in my face
# Plus he keep his right hand right by his waist
# The wrong move will get a gun right in my face
# And they fighting for my life... I'm fighting the case
# And I ain't trying to be the story they twist in the press
# Like: the young man resisted arrest
# Then he started reaching for something that looks like a pistol I guess
# So I pulled on a nigga I mean I pulled on the trigger...figures
# [Hook: Nate Dogg]
# I go around the corner what do I see?
# Po Po's followin me
# Askin for my ID whos car I'm driving
# Po Po's botherin me
# Got me in a lineup, got my hands in cuffs
# They don't wanna set me free
# Trying to bring me down, when they come around
# Po Po's f***in with me
# Awe sh** the jakes are f***ing with me again
# They hate to see me rich, they'd rather see me stuck in the pen
# Everytime they walk or pull up beside me
# Flash lights in my face askin for my registration and ID
# I don't know the reason for the harassment
# And the questions they askin
# Or the ice grills they get when I'm passin
# Or maybe its my fault
# Cause I be out all times at night
# Doin sh** I know I shouldn't plus I don't be ridin right
# Smokin' lye.. no stash box for me to put the skit
# Two warrants, no license and I ain't got insurance yet
# I keep a hammer close because foes wanna stick me up
# But keep my movement swift because Po's wanna frisk me up
# Since '94 I've been told on by 50 descriptions
# And in 10 years not once did they get a conviction
# These pigs shouldn't provoke a rider
# I'm so tired, they got one more time to f*** wit me before I open fire
# [Nate Dogg]
# ones for the money and twos for the show
# three must be for the motherf***in po po'
# I've seen ghetto kings fall to the floor
# cause they can't see ask (?)
# (still some of y'all creepin with the Po Po's
# Sleepin wit the Po Po's
# Some of y'all walking wit the Po Po's
# I ain't f***in with the Po Po's)

# They gon' have to put my back on the cement
# Before I'm in the back with my knee bent
# On my way back to the precinct
# I'm back in the G-bent
# Black wit the pre-tint
# Vanilla aroma to cover the back with the tree scent
# The way I ride I know I'm in for a case
# But the coupe do 200 so they in for a chase
# When it comes to lawyers I got the man Puff uses
# Thats why you never seen my wrists with handcuff bruises
# I got them hollow tips.. to stick up in the AR's
# Detectors in the dash.. to pick up on the radar
# Stash box in it when I purchased the vehicle
# So I don't have a problem wit you searching the vehicle
# They probably want to scoop an arrest
# I try to throw shots but its cool, I got a coupe like a vest
# And 'em troopers will just feel stupid I guess
# The slugs will bounce off like they hittin superman's chest.. nigga
# sh** man a nigga ain't even do sh** awe sh** here comes this dude right now
# Alright buddy unfortunately you came back straight, you and your buddy
# Scain Scholar get the f*** outta here I don't wanna see you guys around here again alright

# How can niggaz say they be on the other side of the seas'
# Where the steering wheels are on the other side of the v's
# And the home look like the spot on the other side of the c's
# When they ain't never been on the other side of the p's
# I ca' see through em', ya tents are too light
# Every sentence you write is far from the truth
# You wanna be that nigga you are in the booth
# But you ain't got the heart, the scars, or the proof
# And now you flash ya' shirt tag in our grill
# But I'm hearin' you was a dirtbag before the deal
# You walk around talkin' how every dime sucked
# When they don't even speak to you, nevermind fucked you
# Ya' hood sayin' don't come back

# All I say to the heffers is "Jesus"
# Keep swallowin my kids, mights as well have no nephews and nieces

# And try an make me crack a smile, just so you can see my chipped tooth
# I'm tryna' get you, in and out of my room
# Just to get, in and out of your womb
# And the rocks in mine glare, somethin like Times Square
# Excuse me miss, you want me to sign where? (sign where?)
# (Chorus)
# Fab's hard to be found
# But most likely I'm with a foreign dame who name's hard to pronounce
# I started out, gettin hard by the ounce
# No more cash in stashes, it's cards in accounts
# The way I make 'em nod to the bounce
# Somebody call Silvia and tell her ship larger amounts
# This playa make 'em scream a scheme
# My closest look like I keep gettin traded from team to team
# Look sleezy, it's difficult but me and Tim the only ones that make pimpin
# look easy
# Tell me how I'm gonna make my album cleaner
# With bitches suckin me up like vacuum cleaners
# Even chickens wanna cluck outside
# (Timbaland:  Yo' Fab, it must be the truck outside)
# And mami can't stop eyein
# And when I said my rims was only nineteens, she said "stop lyin!"

# So you know I came with the heat y'all!
# You know I got a little money, got a little fame
# But you know I came from the streets y'all
# If you wanna act funny, I can do the same
# And when Pharrell let the beat fall
# Let me see you get your hands up high y'all
# Just like you're reaching for the sky y'all
# For the young sexy and fly y'all
# Roll another one, let's get high y'all
# [Verse - Fabolous]
# From the high heels to low cuts
# To the dude in the fast car wit the slow strut girl
# They wanna catch J. Jackson
# But the money's longer than a stretch Maybach Benz
# They say I'm fly enough to do better
# But pimp enough to not give a fuck
# They say I'm old enough to know better
# But young enough to not give a fuck
# Tell Stella to move back, if she want Her Groove Back
# I get my young man on, then the young man gone
# Let's get money again, and even if you ain't
# I'll make you feel twenty again, so!
# Let me see you get your hands up high y'all
# Just like you're reaching for the sky y'all
# For the young sexy and fly y'all
# Take another shot, let's get high y'all
# [Verse - Fabolous]
# I'm too young to be sprung
# And you can tell I'm too blessed to be stressed
# My move is too smooth, on top of that I dress to impress
# The walk is so chilled, not to mention the Talk is so Real
# We all gotta get old, but before I do I'm a ball outta control
# Live young! die rich! woo!

# sorpresa sulla porta d'una felicità
# la bomba ha risparmiato la normalità,
# al ballo mascherato della celebrità.
# La bomba non ha una natura gentile
# ma spinta da imparzialità
# sconvolge l'improbabile intimità
# di un'apparente statua della Pietà.
# Grimilde di Manhattan, statua della libertà,

# La chiamavano bocca di rosa
# metteva l'amore, metteva l'amore,
# la chiamavano bocca di rosa
# metteva l'amore sopra ogni cosa.
# Appena scese alla stazione
# nel paesino di San Vicario
# tutti si accorsero con uno sguardo
# che non si trattava di un missionario.
# C'è chi l'amore lo fa per noia
# chi se lo sceglie per professione
# bocca di rosa n? l'uno n? l'altro
# lei lo faceva per passione.
# Ma la passione spesso conduce
# a soddisfare le proprie voglie
# senza indagare se il concupito
# ha il cuore libero oppure ha moglie.
# E fu così che da un giorno all'altro
# bocca di rosa si tirò addosso
# l'ira funesta delle cagnette
# a cui aveva sottratto l'osso.
# Ma le comari di un paesino
# non brillano certo in iniziativa
# le contromisure fino a quel punto
# si limitavano all'invettiva.
# Si sa che la gente dà buoni consigli
# sentendosi come Gesù nel tempio,
# si sa che la gente dà buoni consigli
# se non può più dare cattivo esempio.
# Così una vecchia mai stata moglie
# senza mai figli, senza più voglie,
# si prese la briga e di certo il gusto
# di dare a tutte il consiglio giusto.
# E rivolgendosi alle cornute
# le apostrofò con parole argute:
# "il furto d'amore sarà punito-
# disse- dall'ordine costituito".
# E quelle andarono dal commissario
# e dissero senza parafrasare:
# "quella schifosa ha già troppi clienti
# più di un consorzio alimentare".
# E arrivarono quattro gendarmi
# con i pennacchi con i pennacchi
# e arrivarono quattro gendarmi
# con i pennacchi e con le armi.
# Spesso gli sbirri e i carabinieri
# al proprio dovere vengono meno
# ma non quando sono in alta uniforme
# e l'accompagnarono al primo treno.
# (nota: qui Fabrizio usa la versione censurata)
# Alla stazione c'erano tutti
# dal commissario al sagrestano
# alla stazione c'erano tutti
# con gli occhi rossi e il cappello in mano,
# a salutare chi per un poco
# senza pretese, senza pretese,
# a salutare chi per un poco
# portò l'amore nel paese.
# C'era un cartello giallo
# con una scritta nera
# diceva "Addio bocca di rosa
# con te se ne parte la primavera".
# Ma una notizia un po' originale
# non ha bisogno di alcun giornale
# come una freccia dall'arco scocca
# vola veloce di bocca in bocca.
# E alla stazione successiva
# molta più gente di quando partiva
# chi mandò un bacio, chi gettò un fiore
# chi si prenota per due ore.
# Persino il parroco che non disprezza
# fra un miserere e un'estrema unzione
# il bene effimero della bellezza
# la vuole accanto in processione.

# "Nel Grembo umido, scuro del tempio,
# l'ombra era fredda, gonfia d'incenso;
# l'angelo scese, come ogni sera,
# ad insegnarmi una nuova preghiera:
# poi, d'improvviso, mi sciolse le mani
# e le mie braccia divennero ali,
# quando mi chiese - Conosci l'estate -
# io, per un giorno, per un momento,
# corsi a vedere il colore del vento.
# Volammo davvero sopra le case,
# oltre i cancelli, gli orti, le strade,
# poi scivolammo tra valli fiorite
# dove all'ulivo si abbraccia la vite.
# Scendemmo là, dove il giorno si perde
# a cercarsi da solo nascosto tra il verde,
# e lui parlò come quando si prega,
# ed alla fine d'ogni preghiera
# contava una vertebra della mia schiena.
# (... e l' angelo disse: "Non
# temere, Maria, infatti hai
# trovato grazia presso il
# Signore e per opera Sua
# concepirai un figlio...)
# Le ombre lunghe dei sacerdoti
# costrinsero il sogno in un cerchio di voci.
# Con le ali di prima pensai di scappare
# ma il braccio era nudo e non seppe volare:
# poi vidi l'angelo mutarsi in cometa
# e i volti severi divennero pietra,
# le loro braccia profili di rami,
# nei gesti immobili d'un altra vita,
# foglie le mani, spine le dita.
# Voci di strada, rumori di gente,
# mi rubarono al sogno per ridarmi al presente.
# Sbiadì l'immagine, stinse il colore,
# ma l'eco lontana di brevi parole
# ripeteva d'un angelo la strana preghiera
# dove forse era sogno ma sonno non era
# - Lo chiameranno figlio di Dio -
# Parole confuse nella mia mente,
# svanite in un sogno, ma impresse nel ventre."
# E la parola ormai sfinita
# si sciolse in pianto,
# ma la paura dalle labbra
# si raccolse negli occhi
# semichiusi nel gesto
# d'una quiete apparente
# che si consuma nell'attesa

# ma un re senza corona e senza scorta
# bussò tre volte un giorno alla sua porta
# bianco come la luna il suo cappello
# come l'amore rosso il suo mantello
# tu lo seguisti senza una ragione

# e c'era il sole e avevi gli occhi belli

# c'era la luna e avevi gli occhi stanchi
# lui pose la mano sui tuoi fianchi
# furono baci furono sorrisi
# poi furono soltanto i fiordalisi
# che videro con gli occhi delle stelle
# fremere al vento e ai baci la tua pelle
# dicono poi che mentre ritornavi
# nel fiume chissà come scivolavi
# e lui che non ti volle creder morta
# bussò cent'anni ancora alla tua porta
# questa è la tua canzone Marinella

# Matrimoni per amore, matrimoni per forza
# ne ho visti di ogni tipo, di gente d'ogni sorta
# di poveri straccioni e di grandi signori
# di pretesi notai e di falsi professori
# ma pure se vivrò fino alla fine del tempo
# io sempre serberò il ricordo contento
# delle povere nozze di mio padre e mia madre
# decisi a regolare il loro amore sull'altare.
# Fu su un carro da buoi se si vuole essere franchi
# tirato dagli amici e spinto dai parenti
# che andarono a sposarsi dopo un fidanzamento
# durato tanti anni da chiamarsi ormai d'argento.
# Cerimonia originale, strano tipo di festa,
# la folla ci guardava gli occhi fuori dalla testa
# eravamo osservati dalla gente civile
# che mai aveva visto matrimoni in quello stile.
# Ed ecco soffia il vento e si porta lontano
# il cappello che mio padre tormentava in una mano
# ecco cade la pioggia da un cielo mal disposto
# deciso ad impedire le nozze ad ogni costo.
# Ed io non scorderò mai la sposa in pianto
# cullava come un bimbo i suoi fiori di campo
# ed io per consolarla, io con la gola tesa
# suonavo la mia armonica come un organo da chiesa.
# Mostrando i pugni nudi gli amici tutti quanti
# gridarono "per Giove, le nozze vanno avanti"
# per la gente bagnata, per gli dei dispettosi
# le nozze vanno avanti, viva viva gli sposi.

# eppure c'è luce ormai nei miei pensieri,
# qui nella penombra ora invento parole

# Le mie ossa regalano ancora alla vita:

# "Poterti smembrare coi denti e le mani,
# sapere i tuoi occhi bevuti dai cani,
# di morire in croce puoi essere grato
# a un brav'uomo di nome Pilato."
# Ben più della morte che oggi ti vuole,
# t'uccide il veleno di queste parole:
# le voci dei padri di quei neonati,
# da Erode per te trucidati.
# Nel lugubre scherno degli abiti nuovi
# misurano a gocce il dolore che provi;
# trent'anni hanno atteso col fegato in mano,
# i rantoli d'un ciarlatano.
# Si muovono curve le vedove in testa,
# per loro non è un pomeriggio di festa;
# si serran le vesti sugli occhi e sul cuore
# ma filtra dai veli il dolore:
# fedeli umiliate da un credo inumano
# che le volle schiave già prima di Abramo,
# con riconoscenza ora soffron la pena
# di chi perdonò a Maddalena,
# di chi con un gesto soltanto fraterno
# una nuova indulgenza insegnò al Padreterno,
# e guardano in alto, trafitti dal sole,
# gli spasimi d'un redentore.
# Confusi alla folla ti seguono muti,
# sgomenti al pensiero che tu li saluti:
# "A redimere il mondo" gli serve pensare,
# il tuo sangue può certo bastare.
# La semineranno per mare e per terra
# tra boschi e città la tua buona novella,
# ma questo domani, con fede migliore,
# stasera è più forte il terrore.
# Nessuno di loro ti grida un addio
# per esser scoperto cugino di Dio:
# gli apostoli han chiuso le gole alla voce,
# fratello che sanguini in croce.
# Han volti distesi, già inclini al perdono,
# ormai che han veduto il tuo sangue di uomo
# fregiarti le membra di rivoli viola,
# incapace di nuocere ancora.
# Il potere vestito d'umana sembianza,
# ormai ti considera morto abbastanza
# e già volge lo sguardo a spiar le intenzioni
# degli umili, degli straccioni.
# Ma gli occhi dei poveri piangono altrove,
# non sono venuti a esibire un dolore
# che alla via della croce ha proibito l'ingresso
# a chi ti ama come se stesso.
# Sono pallidi al volto, scavati al torace,
# non hanno la faccia di chi si compiace
# dei gesti che ormai ti propone il dolore,
# eppure hanno un posto d'onore.
# Non hanno negli occhi scintille di pena.
# Non sono stupiti a vederti la schiena
# piegata dal legno che a stento trascini,
# eppure ti stanno vicini.
# Perdonali se non ti lasciano solo,
# se sanno morir sulla croce anche loro,
# a piangerli sotto non han che le madri,

# Open-minded educated

# And if you're scared they couldn't care less of you
# Get over yourself now
# It's fame and popularity
# I'll never understand
# If it feels like this is what you need

# Innocence and innuendo
# Confidence and acquiescence now
# And you still won't make it
# Self-consciousness is not a virtue
# Everyone is looking at you now
# You may never make it
> Face To Face
# Ignorance and arrogance mean quite the same to me
# Take a look around you and I'm sure you will agree
# The world is full of people filled with hatred filled with greed
# It's such a rare example when you've found a human being
# You could've had everything but you
# You would've been scared of what to do
# You should've been so much more to us than just exonerated
# Why shouldn't it break your heart in two?
# I find little entertains me anymore
# The problems of the world are often tedious and worn
# I'm reading all about it with a chuckle and a sneer
# They say a new beginning and they say the end is near
# Get in your self-assuredness and take it for a spin
# You'll be standing by yourself when they've all given in
# It's "take before it's taken from you" every single day
# I wish it wasn't like this
# I don't know another way
> Face To Face
# There's nothing here inside of these walls
# I feel like I am so far away
# Nothing's changed
# And I just can't be who I'm supposed to be
# I let the past control my life
# It brings me to my knees
# And I can not hide
# I can not lie
# So many words to say and no one to hear
# Why did you go away?
# I needed you more today that I ever did
# You lied to me
# Outside it's cold
# It chills to the bone
# I wish that I did not have to see
# I let the past control my life
# It brings me to my knees
# And I can not hide
# I can not lie
# So many words to say and no one to hear
# Why did you go away?
# I needed you more today that I ever did
# You lied to me
> Face To Face
# You don't know what you want to be
# You don't know what you want to do
# Never going to amount to much of anything
# So what's the difference if you win or lose?
# Well that's something
# Well isn't that something
# You've done nothing wrong and it's never your fault
# You've done nothing
# Don't care where your friends have gone
# Because you never really needed them anyway
# Never going to be exactly who you are
# Because you try too hard to be just like them
# Well that's something
# Well isn't that something
# You've done nothing wrong and it's never your fault
# You've done nothing
# You've got brains in your head
# Feet in your shoes
# You can steer yourself
# Anyway you choose
# You're on your own
# And you know what you know
# And it's up to you to decide where you'll go
# Well that's something
# Well isn't that something
# You've done nothing wrong and it's never your fault
# You've done nothing
> Face To Face
# So what's the problem now this time?
# I thought you'd learn by now that nothing ever works out right
# You want to take away the edge
# You tell me it's only thing that helps you forget
# You've made your promises
# That's not enough this time
# There's only so much you can squander from a feeble mind
# You've got a problem with your life
# You've got a problem with your mind
# Don't try to tell me that you think it's going to work out fine
# So go ahead and try to hide
# The world around you watches on as you destroy your life
# Do what your problem says
# There's not a lot of time
# There's only so much you can squander from a feeble mind
# You've got a problem with your life

# Lyrics Transcribed by Leonie's Team Member - Ghettofabulous98
# I was getting fed up
# With all your dipping out with every girl around town
# You know what I'm talking 'bout
# Cause you've been caught
# And I forgave you many times
# But now I slipped up
# And while your friend was around
# I gave him a taste of my love
# I know that I broke your trust for a night of lust
# But don't let that break us up
# Trying to peep my game baby
# I know what's going on when you say your alone
# And you won't pick up the phone
# Trying to peep my game baby
# You can't even hate
# Don't get up in my face
# Cause your boy got a taste
# He is your best man, your best friend
# I guess you didn't know that I had him
# I know that you hate that
# It's like that
# You were the best but yet he ain't so bad
# He is your best man, your best friend
# I guess you didn't know that I had him
# I know that you hate that
# It's like that
# You were the best but yet he ain't so bad
# I needed a shoulder to cry on
# But I got more than a shoulder that night
# I know that you're mad and you're angry
# Who gives a damn?
# You didn't treat me right
# You know that I love you
# More than anything, you are the center of my life
# It was just tipper-tap, a little pay back
# Let it go and leave it like that
# Trying to peep my game baby
# I know what's going on when you say your alone
# And you won't pick up the phone
# Trying to peep my game baby
# You can't even hate
# Don't get up in my face
# Cause your boy got a taste
# He is your best man, your best friend
# I guess you didn't know that I had him
# I know that you hate that
# It's like that
# You were the best but yet he ain't so bad
# He is your best man, your best friend
# I guess you didn't know that I had him
# I know that you hate that
# It's like that
# You were the best but yet he ain't so bad
# So many times you broke my heart
# I never thought that it would heal
# So I decided to return the pain
# You always make me feel
# Now I won't try to justify
# But I'm telling you why
# If you think that someone else is in my life
# Then maybe you'll treat me right, yeah

# Drawing me closer, closer to you baby
# I can't explain, its just the magic that we share
# Something between us two
# Repeat 1
# Sitting here in my hotel thinking of nothing
# But your face, whoa baby
# I try to remember how we used to be
# When you used to love me
# Love me everyday and oh baby
# 2 - I don't want to fight you
# Just want you to see
# That you're are the one
# The only one that's for me
# Baby let me show you
# There's no greater love
# Baby I love you for the things you do
# And I want you to come over
# Repeat 1
# Repeat 2
# Repeat 1

# Baby don't be afraid of
# Afraid of my love
# Since we've been together baby
# It hasn't been too long
# But I slowly feel myself
# Falling love again
# And I want to give you more
# Of what I have inside
# But if I open up to you
# Baby you got to love me too
# 2 - Everytime I think about
# The time we spend together baby
# Holding hands and making love
# Long walks and morning talks
# I can't believe you only thought
# We were friends
# Boy you can't pretend
# 1 - Baby don't be afraid of
# Afraid of my love
# My baby don't be afraid of
# Afraid of my love
# Take some time to listen boy
# It's not so hard to do
# Why can't you understand
# After all that we've been through
# If you cut away your pride
# And search within yourself
# I know you'll change your mind
# Cause I'll be with someone else
# Repeat 1
# Repeat 2
# If I didn't have you baby
# I don't know what I'd do
# Cause you make me happy and I'm
# giving you all my love
# I never want to be without you
# I don't know what I'd do
# Cause you make me happy so boy
# Don't be afraid of my love
# Repeat 1

# Baby, if i just been a little different lately.
# But i wanna understand you so much more.
# Open the door. anything just tell me.
# Open up and say it baby.
# [Faith Evans]
# Lately, i've been tryin to keep my distance crazy.
# It's not what i expected at first
# But now i undersatnad you gotta be a man.
# And now it so clear to me so you can keep it real with me.
# You ever wondered what makes a woman cry
# you ever wondered why sometimes you make me cry
# you ever wondered what makes a woman smile
# its just the little things, you do to make me smile
# Maybe, we jumped into this situation to early
# But it's something that our bodies can't ignore
# Now you want more but i think i'm ready
# Just open up and say it baby
# Baby,not to mention that you got me feelin' crazy
# Everytime you walk through my door
# My emotions won't let me say no
# And now i'm wonderin' if i could??
# [Chorus 1x]
# You see i'm feelin' you
# You know i'm wantin' to
# Put all my trust in you
# 'cause aint no guarantee
# And i'm so glad you do
# I feel the same way too
# All we gotta do is keep communicating
# [Chorus 2x]

# Oh, oh...
# 1 - Falling in love, falling in love again
# Falling in love again with you
# Falling in love, falling in love again
# Falling in love again with you
# Sometimes I think about you
# And I remember all the things we went through
# And I realize that I need you
# I've fallen so in love with you
# Repeat 1
# Oh it's funny how things change
# Not long ago I thought my love for you would fade away
# Your love gets sweeter everyday
# So in love with you I want to stay, so baby
# 2 - Promise that you'll stay
# Never take your love away
# Cause I need your love
# You're stuck in my heart
# Don't you know
# And the feeling is strong
# And I can't let you go
# Repeat 1
# Repeat 2
# Repeat 1
# I'm all that you want and more

# Repeat 1
> Faith Evans
# I can remember the day and time that we broke up
# It was December and the holidays were coming up
# I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect to loose all of the time I shared with you
# But now that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone I find myself longing for you
# No doubt about it IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sorry for the way things worked out
# If I could change it I would change it but I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how
# Oooooooooooooooooo
# (No I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t no need to cry when I know the reason why)
# You chose to leave me but I still wish you were here with me
# Its true I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get over you
# No matter what I do
# Even if I try I, I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get over you
# I can remember calling your phone and hanging up
# Cause I was to afraid to talk, if by chance you picked it up
# But now that I done thought about it,
# IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d feel better if we talk about it
# And let you know whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on my mind
# See I wanna try to make things right.
# [Repeat Prelude]
# [Repeat Chorus]
# Lately IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been doing some reminiscing
# IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be lying if I said that I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss you
# I have feelings from deep in the past
# Cause now I need you back
# It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so bad
# [Repeat Chorus 2x]
# I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get over you
# I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get over you
# No I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get over
# Said no way I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get over
# I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get over you
# Alright yea yea

# 1 - You abandoned me
# Love don't live here anymore
# Just a vacancy
# Love don't live here anymore

# There was nothing I could conceive
# That you wouldn't do for me
# Trouble seemed so far away
# You changed that right away
# Repeat 1
# Oh, oh...
# [Mary J. Blige]:
# Love don't live here anymore
# Just emptiness and memories of what we had before
# You went away
# Found another place to stay, another heart

# Through the windows of my eyes
# Everyone can see the loneliness inside of me
# Why did you have to go away
# Don't you know I miss you so
# I need your love

# You got me so caught up

# To fall in love was something that my heart was dreaming of,
# and then there came the day when I found you
# then heaven came to earth and you were my angel,
# I fell in love with you
# no one but you
# and suddenly I saw the change that came into your eyes
# I feel you were afraid to tell me why
# I thought this thing called love would be forever,
# I thought our love was true
# and now the pain of losing you
# (chorus)
# If you never know just what you mean,
# you are my first love
# if you never know,
# you're everything
# you are my first love
# tell me how a thing that brings such joy can bring such pain
# and how could something so wrong seem so right
# we never had the chance to make it get better
# we never said goodbye
# I never wanna feel the pain of losing love again,
# 'cause love just has a way of breaking down,
# next time I'm gonna pray that this will be better
# the second time around,
# so here's to love that's lost and found
# I won't cry, no, I won't break down
# even though inside it hurts so bad
# next time I will make love last
# though you will always have a plave in my heart
# (chorus)
# if you never know just what you mean,
# you are my first love
# if you never know,
# you're everything
# you are my first love
# my first love, no one could ever take your place, no, no
> Faith Evans
# If I had one wish, boy
# I'd wish you next to me
# And it could be in summer, fall or spring, boy
# Cuz you make my heart sing
# I wanna give my heart, my soul, my love to you
# Oh baby, yeah
# Cuz every day I'm not with you
# I'm missing you like crazy
# I need for you to
# I need for you to love me
# Hold me
# Touch me
# Down deep in my soul
# And never let it go
# Of the love we share
# No one compares to you
# I'll never let you go
# Cuz I really love you so
# Oh I, I'll never let you go, oh no
# If you must know the truth, boy
# I'm nothing without you
# It's funny how I know what people mean, boy
# When it's too good to be true
# Because you bring me joy, good love
# Good times, such happiness, oh yeah
# And every day I thank the Lord for you
# I feel so blessed
# I need for you to love
# Hold me
# Touch me
# Down deep in my soul
# And never let it go
# Of the love we share
# No one compares to you
# I'll never let you go
# Cuz I really love you so
# Oh I, I'll never let you go, oh no
# If you only knew
# What you really do
# Ain't never had no one that does it quite like you
# You could spend half a lifetime
# Trying to find one like you
# That's why I am so glad I found you, babe
# I wished a upon a star, it came true
# Darling, I need for you to
# Hold me
# Touch me
# Down deep in my soul
# And never let it go
# Of the love we share
# No one compares to you
# I'll never let you go
# Cuz I really love you so
# Oh I, I'll never let you go, oh no

# I can never tell you
# That I didn't love you now
# Cause no other love can compare to you
# Ooh...

# This is something I, I must confess
# You're the only lover, who can love me like no other

# I knew from the start you were running game
# You'd fade away like Jordan then cross me over when you come back again
# I'm not superwoman so i can't see what's goign on in your mind
# It's been so long that i strung you along
# So many dates, so many hours on the phone
# And i know you getting tired of playing the game of cat and mouse
# I wonder if i let you catch me, would you run your mouth
# So i'm not sure if i wanna
# Stop
# Go
# Just move slow
# Let
# Go
# And enjoy the moment
# Stop
# Go
# So confusing that i
# Don't
# Know
# I feel i wanna explode
# We're in the first quarter and i feel i wanna but i know we oughta not
# Cuz if i pass it to you there's a chance that you might mess around and drop the rock
# So you better make sure in the court you're the best i've ever seen
# Cuz i would hate to have to trade you to another team
# It's been so hard playing my emotions off
# Knowing that i wanna give in but too afraid to go too far
# And i know you're getting tired of playing the game of hard to get
# But i wonder if i let you in would you tell your friends
# So i'm not sure if i wanna
# Stop, go
# Just move slow
# Let go
# And enjoy the momeny
# Stop, go
# So confusing that i
# Don't know
# I feel i wanna explode
# My heart, says yes
# My mind, says no
# Cuz i don't know if i wanna break down and let go
# My heart, says yes
# My mind, says no
# Cuz i know if i'm ready now i'll be wanting more
# More this, more that
# More time, to chat
# And i'll be wanting a commitment from you and much more attention
# That's why i'm so confused
# When it comes to loving you
# Stop, go
# Just move slow
# Let go
# And enjoy the moment
# Stop, go
# So confusing that i
# Don't know
# Feel i wanna explode
# Stop, go
# Just move slow
# Let go
# And enjoy the moment
# Stop, go
# So confusing that i
# Don't know
# Feel i wanna explode

# 1 -  Wipe your tears away
# You don’t have to cry no more, no more
# Wipe your tears away
# You don’t have to cry no more
# Take my hand and follow me
# I’ve got everything you need
# Long ago I had a dream
# Someone would come and share the years ahead
# So I waited and I prayed that he didn’t come too late
# (I didn’t know, know your name, but oh)
# I wanted him to say to me oh?
# Repeat 1
# Come to me so that I can be in love
# (How I long to be in love)
# I carried on in life alone
# No one to hold
# But I’m still strong
# 2 - Will I always be alone
# Trying to wait by the phone?
# Hoping one day soon you’re gonna find me
# That you’ll take me by the hand
# And then you’ll wipe my tears away?
# Repeat 1
# Repeat 2
# Tears away, tears away
# Won’t you wipe my tears away
# Tears away, tears away
# Won’t you wipe my tears away
# Tears away, tears away

# [Verse 1:]
# Six Years five months
# That's how long we've been havein' this thing
# We've got every moment hasn't been perfect
# But still when it's perfect it feels
# Like we're the only people who have somethin' real
# Now 3 years two weeks
# That's how long we've been raisin' our family
# And I wouldn't go tradin
# The love we got
# So don't go changin'
# I love you just the way you are
# It's true love
# When you say I need me like the way i need you
# And you can't be without me
# Like I can't be without you
# It's true love
# When we spend time talking on the phone
# Cause when we're not around each other you don't want to be alone
# It's true love, love, love, love
# Don't you know it's good to be in love, love, love, love
# Just believe me truthfully cause
# Love is never ever makin you cry
# Before I tell you a lie
# I'll give you my life
# Cause that true love
# [Verse 2:]
# Now when the love is right
# Somehow you just know
# Because you hold it tight
# And you don't want to let it go
# And it's so deep inside of you that
# You just can't take it cause it fills up your heart
# And you just, you can't replace it alone
# Somebody's makin love
# Non-stop tonight
# And And they can't make enough
# I know what it feels like
# Grab your lover by the hand
# Say that you understand
# How love really works
# So good that it hurts
# Cause I don't need nobody but you in my life oh baby
# Those of you who understand what I'm sayin'
# Sing along with me say
# Cause I don't need nobody but
# You in my life oh baby
# Those of you who understand what I'm sayin'
# Let me hear you say true love
> Faith Evans
# [Verse 1]
# Love was just a four letter word
# Misused to entrust the heart of followers
# But it never meant a damn thing to me
# Until you came so unexpectedly
# Then you curved my whole attitude
# Got me feelin' ways that I never thought I could
# See really what I'm tryin' to say is I like what I'm feelin'
# And I hope you never take it away
# I never gave my heart to love
# I never gave my time to love
# I never even cared for love
# Until you came
# Baby I never gave my heart to love
# I never gave my time to love
# I never even cared for love
# And then you came, baby I
# [Verse 2]
# I can't believe you walked through my defenses
# And made me smooth out my rough ends and
# You got me open and I'm hopin' that this ain't no act
# 'Cause I don't want no parts of that
# Matter fact, I really hope that you're true
# 'Cause I wanna invest my time in you
# And all my childish dreams with all my conversations
# 'Cause I know that somethin' special's in the makin' I
# [Chorus (1x)]
# Ooh la la la la la la
# Ooh la la la la la la
# La la la la la la la
# [Faith talking]
# Yo! Seriously though, I'm buggin'. I'm, I'm really confused
# 'Cause I trust you with some things you say, but with other things
# I just don't trust you. But my mama said work with it, you know what I mean?
# It's like I've been going through all these emotions
# And I'm dealin' with stuff I've never dealt with before
# It's like you just, hmm, you got me straight trippin' boo.
# I don't even know what's wrong with me.
# But I hope you understand how I feel, 'cause I really care about you.
# So check this out baby.

# I know you feel it too
# I know the feeling
# It is the real thing
# You can't refuse the embrace...
# It's like the pattern below the skin
# You gotta reach out and pull it all in
# And you feel like you're too close
# So you swallow another dose
# The pinnacle of happiness
# Filling up your soul
# You don't think you can take any more
# You never wanna let go
# To touch the roots of experience
# The most basic ingredients
# To see the unseen glitter of life
# And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife
# Cherish the certainly of now
# It kills you a bit at a time
# Cradle the inspiration
# It will leave you writhing on the floor...
# This is so unreal, what I feel
# This nourishment, life is bent
# Into a shape I can hold
# A twist of fate, all my own
# Just grit your teeth, make no sound
# Take a step away and look around
# Just clench your fist and close your eyes
# Look deep inside, hypnotize
# The whisper is but a shout
# That's what it is all about
# Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
# You will never let it slip away
# Like the sacred song that someone sings through you
# Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into
# Like the dream you know one day will come to life
# Try to hold on just a little longer, stronger
# It's the jewel of victory
# The chasm of misery
# And once you have bitten the core
# You will always know the flavor
# The split second of divinity
# You drink up the sky
# All of heaven is in your arms
# You know the reason why
# It's right there, all by itself
# And what you are, there is nothing else
# You're growing a life within a life
# The lips of wonder kiss you inside
# And when it's over the feeling remains
# It all comes down to this
# The smoke clears, I see what it is
# That made me feel this way...
# This is so unreal, what I feel
# Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood
# Pump through your veins, can't explain
# The element that's everything
# Just clench your fist and close your eyes
# Look deep inside, hypnotize
# Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
# You will never let it slip away
# Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after
# Like the first time love urged you to take it's guidance, in silence
# Like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying
# Like the way you cry for a happy ending, ending...

# [Verse 1:]
# I put your picture on my mirror,
# Start to blush when somebody says your name
# In my stomach there's a pain
# See you walk in my direction I go the other way
# I start to stutter when I speak
# Try to stand but my knees go weak
# What happening to me in the dark can you tell me what it means
# I lay my head on my pillow
# Staring out the window
# Wish on a star for a sign
# It's the reason why
# [Chorus:]
# Your always on my mind
# When you come around I get shy
# When I see you, when I see you
# Never know when you might walk by
# So I gotta be right on time
# When I see you when I see you
# [Verse 2:]
# I scribble X and O's in my notebook
# Checking how my hair and nails look
# I feel myself in the zone
# I get nervous when you call
# So I say I'm not home
# I see your face when I hear my favorite song
# Should I Send an email at home
# You're the number 1 topic on the phone,
# I wonder if you know or do you have a clue
# I lay my head on my pillow
# You got me staring out the window
# Wish on a star for a sign
# Whats the reason why Yeah...
# [Chorus]
# Something now is taking over me,
# Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
# I'm not going run I'm
# Just go to stand here and see yeah
# Oh
# Yeah

# [Verse one]
# Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could have,
# Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should have,
# If I made you feel second best,
# I'm so sorry I was blind...
# [Chorus]
# You were always on my mind
# You were always on my mind
# [Verse two]
# Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times,
# And I guess I never told you I'm so happy that you're mine,
# Little things I should have said and done,
# I just never took the time...
# [chorus]
# You were always on my mind

# Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died,
# Baby, give me, give me one more chance to keep you satisfied,

# On my dreams, yeah I'm gon get it
# Win it like the Lotto, dressed in Amavado
# Alligator shoe, when I smash on the throttle
# Angry super model, paparazzi follow
# Money hoes and clothes, it make my head hollow
# I'm drinking out the bottle, to ride on my sorrow
# A better day tomorrow, is all I wish for
# A millionaire dream, plus a whole lot more
# The country I'll explore, navigator
# System guides my way, for the lyrical AK
# [Hook - 2x]
# [Fat Pat]
# Stacks to be made, in the world gon get it
# Opportunities come, a mile a minute
# From start to finish, have big dreams baby
# Coming down Mercedes, everybody's angry
# Rapper or emcee, whatever you wanna call it
# Credit cards or cash, we balling in the mall and
# Hauling, three T.V.'s in my load
# Marble on my dash, got wood on my do's
# Who knows, what the world unfold as it go
# Round and round, I'ma keep putting it down
# Endo pounds, getting sent from out of town
# Me and my partna, in the kitchen breaking chickens down
# Making plastic fried, whoa look at me now
# I'm shining like the sun, Rolex dimaonds
# Here I come here I come, top down in my Bentley
# All my enemies looking, but come on get me
# [Hook - 2x]
# [Fat Pat]
# This just the beginning, of a next episode
# The game unfold, down a 24 karat road
# To success, no settling for less
# Strive to be the best, if I'm broke I can't rest
# Mind full of stress, so I break for my dream
# Like I'm running a marathon, and capalon hustle for me
# And my son, my job is never done
# It's like I'm one on one, me against the world
# And it's hard to hold on, but I keep a tight grip
# Write another song, drop it like it's hot no time to prolong
# Get out the hood, was something like a dream
# Whoever thought, Fat Pat would rap sing
# Have all these things, I'll be just like a king
# In your face one more time, just to let you know
# Coming up is impossible, if you don't hustle
# Trust no info, coming from the back
# Cause haters come in all size and forms, and that's a fact
# When I was growing up, I never got no slack
# No handouts for Pat, had to grind for it black
# I let my nuts hang in the game, pumped hard for it mayn
# When it sleets no rain, I wanted big thangs
# Plus a whole lot of what, pocket change
# Don't knock Pat, coming down the boulevard true
# Fantasies and dreams, I just came through

# Now I got fame, I ain't the one to blame
# Now them boys wanna be trying to what, claim
# A big old pimp, by the name of P-A-T
# Living in luxury, doing it like a O.G
# Everyday, all day

# Ike will spray, leave candy red
# Came up out the shop, and I turned a lot of heads
# Got new friends, cause I got ends

# Right behind him is the Lincoln, my favorite toy
# Candy red with the screens, and I'm riding on cream
# Mean mugs triple beams, make reality a dream
# Sipping lean sticky green, make em cloud the whole scene
# Europeans what the deal, making all haters chill
# While I show my naked skills, gripping wood grain grills
# Running lights shining bright, floating smooth as a kite
# Trunk cracked Fat Pat, breaking all haters hats
# Where they at where they at, 'fore I pull out my gat
# Looking good it's understood, flossing for my hood
# Taking pride in my ride, like every playa should

# They say she had a heart-attack, I think the creature's coming back,
# And I am flyin' coz all my love's electofying,
# And I can't feel like a cess-pool, I wanna be like you.
# And it's my premonition, I better give my heart a listen,
# And the creature says...
# Chorus :
# All of your demons will wither away,
# Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay,
# You'll understand when you come my way,
# Coz all of my demons have withered away.
# All of your demons will wither away.
# They say he shook himself to death, I wanna dance til my last breath,
# But Mr. Orchid only parties hard, and I said,
# Go feel like a cess-pool, wanna be with you, wanna be with you.

# really all good?  You serious?  I'm serious.  If it is, then I gotta
# jump on it, ride it--ghetto cowboy.  Surprise, you thought I was quiet.
# I never was shy, baby.  Niggas just act like that.  Lay back, but don't
# let that fool ya, rule ya.  Really give that the nigga the bag, 'cause
# we won't have time to talk.  I've been peepin' for a minute now [Yep,
# yep, yep . . .], and I know just where I'm a start.  Let me listen to
# your heartbeat.  Boomp, boomp, racin' in this situation.  Is it gettin'
# kind of hot in here?  Naw, that's you.  Temperature's risin', so am I.

# Mavrica luči, beli biseri letijo naokrog,
# ples nevidnih rok.
# Vmes vrti se svet, koket in striptizet,
# namišljenih bogov, utrganih sadov.
# A marsikdaj se najde sveža vrtnica,
# en dotik, ki nežno zadehti, brez skrbi.
# Disko raj, vse device plešejo,
# omamljene se dvigajo v raj tu in zdaj.
# Lahko sva to samo en dan,
# lahko mi daš za vedno svojo dlan.
# Neon v očeh, vino na zobeh,
# vonj sproščanja skokov v ritmu teh valov.
# Magične vezi trgajo strasti,
# prepletanje teles, beračevih princes.
# A marsikdaj se najde sveža vrtnica,
# en dotik, ki nežno zadehti, brez skrbi.
# Disko raj, vse device plešejo,
# omamljene se dvigajo v raj tu in zdaj.
# Lahko sva to samo en dan,
# lahko mi daš za vedno svojo dlan.

# But now - miracle is not so hard to find.
# There were times when I really doubted,
# If, after stormy weather, always comes the sun,
# But now - I can see the world from a different side, yeah.
# Singer after singer, remembered,
# Different flags, but nations gathered –
# From the north to the south, all standing side by side.
# There was laughter, and there was crying,
# But after all, I'm not denying –
# I'm so happy to be here, 'cause it’s the time of my life…

# No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior
# Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
# Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more.
# 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, Turn the lights on.
# I know I might come off as negative
# I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love
# But, relationships are often so hard to tame
# A Prada dress has never broke my heart before
# And, ballin's something that I'm fed up with
# I'mma do the damn thing, watch me do the damn thing
# Cause I know that my credit card will help me put out the flames
# I guess I'm Supercalifragi-sexy, nothing to be playing with
# I love him, hate him, kiss him, diss him, tryna walk a mile in my kicks
# [Chorus]
# Love's like a runway but which one do I love more?
# No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior
# Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
# Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more.
# 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, Turn the lights on.
# Gucci, Fendi, Prada purses, purchasing them finer things
# Men they come a dime a dozen, just give me them diamond rings
# I'm into a lot of bling, Cadillac, Chanel and Coach
# Fellas boast but they can't really handle my female approach
# Buying things is hard to say
# Rocking Christian Audigier, Manolo, Polo, taking photos in my Cartier
# So we can't go all the way, I know you might hate it but
# I'm a shop for labels while them ladies lay and wait for love
# [Chorus]
# Love's like a runway but which one do I love more?
# No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior
# Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
# Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more.
# 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, Turn the lights on.
# Shopping for labels, shopping for love
# Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of
# Shopping for labels, shopping for love
# 1, 2
# Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of
# 1, 2, 3 Turn the lights on.

# at the end of this narrow hall
# I wish it didn't matter
# I wish I didn't give you all
# But if I wanted silence I would whisper
# If I wanted loneliness I'd choose o go
# If I liked rejection I'd audition
# And if I didn't love you, you would know
# So why can't you just hold me
# How come it's so hard?
# Do you like to see me broken?
# Why do I still care?
# Poor little misunderstood baby
# No one likes a sad face
# But I can't remember life without him
# I think I did have good days

# Show me how you do that trick

# The one that makes me laugh he said
# And threw his arms around my neck
# Show me how you do it
# And I promise you I promise that
# I'll run away with you
# I'll run away with you
# Spinning on that dizzy edge
# I kissed his face and kissed his head
# And dreamed of all the different ways I had
# To make him glow
# Why are you so far away? he said
# Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you
# That I'm in love with you

# Dancing in the deepest oceans
# Twisting in the water
# You're just like a dream
# You're just like a dream
# Daylight licked me into shape
# I must have been asleep for days
# And moving lips to breathe his name
# I opened up my eyes
# And found myself alone alone
# Alone above a raging sea
# That stole the only boy I loved
# And drowned him deep inside of me

# I'm sure I upset someone but my memory has chosen to omit it
# A tiny voice telling me I really should cool it
# Chewing my face off talking absolute rubbish
# The first line hit me like a kick in the face
# I thought "I'd better have another one just in case"
# Next thing i knew, my heart was under attack
# I bought a one way ticket to hell...and back
# One way ticket to hell and back
# Bought a one way ticket to hell and back
# One way ticket to hell and back
# Bought a one way ticket to hell...
# I've always tried to keep my vices under wraps
# But a coach-load of mutes would appear talkative chaps
# If they had seen fit to join me for a couple of hits
# Now my septum is in tatters and I've still got the runs
# Burned for a moment, then it kicked like a mule
# The strangers I recruited thought it was rocket fuel
# Several massive choking lines of glorius gack
# I bought a one way ticket to hell...and back
# One way ticket to hell and back
# Bought a one way ticket to hell and back
# One way ticket to hell and back
# Bought a one way ticket to hell...
# Stick it up your f***ing nose!

# Mezzanotte di una domenica di luglio
# partivo in seguto a paura o un grande sbaglio
# luccicava quella strada bagnata
# la mia mente confusa e annebbiata
# avevo dei soldi rubati a un amico
# un motivo in più per il quale mi facevo quasi schifo
# ma la vita a volte è anche questo
# è solo che io non ci resisto
# sono un uomo in fuga
# in fuga dal nulla
# in cerca di gloria
# ma forse neanche di quella
# sono un uomo in fuga
# in fuga da sempre
# ma le mie urla non si sono spente
# ma le mie urla non si sono spente
# Dentro uno stupido bar per fare passare il tempo
# il mio dolore con il bere quasi non lo sento
# non che qualche cosa sia cambiato
# non che penso che sia passato
# ma bisogna sotterrare le angosce
# quella resa che nel cuore ti cresce
# perchè anche l'ultimo dei perdenti
# non vive solo per i suoi lamenti
# sono un uomo in fuga
# in fuga dal nulla
# in cerca di gloria
# ma forse neanche di quella
# sono un uomo in fuga
# in fuga da sempre
# ma le mie urla non si sono spente
# ma le mie urla nessuno le sente
# solo rimango
# solo rimango
# non mi sentite che piango?
# solo rimango
# solo rimango
# non mi sentite che piango?
# sono un uomo in fuga
# in fuga dal nulla
# in cerca di gloria
# ma forse neanche di quella
# sono un uomo in fuga
# in fuga da sempre
# ma le mie urla non si sono spente
# sono un uomo in fuga
# in fuga dal nulla
# in cerca di gloria
# ma forse neanche di quella

# I'm either so sick in the head
# I need to be bled dry, to quit
# Or I just really used to love him
# I sure hope thats it
# I knew that to keep in touch
# Would do me deep in dutch
# Cuz it isn't the rush of remembering
# Its just mush
# And the signature thing
# Is only growing harrowing
# I should have no trouble now
# To keep from following
# So why did I kiss him so hard
# Late last Friday night
# And keep on letting him change all my plans
# I'm either so sick in the head
# I need to be bled dry, to quit
# Or I just really used to love him
# I sure hope thats it
# Those boon times went bust
# My feet of clay, they dried to dust
# The red isn't the red we painted
# Its just rust
# And the signature thing
# That used to bring a following
# I have trouble now
# Even remembering
# So why did I kiss him so hard
# Late last Friday night
# And keep on letting him change all my plans
# I'm either so sick in the head
# I need to be bled dry, to quit
# Or I just really used to love him
# Or I just really used to love him
# Or I just really used to love him
# I sure hope that's it

# And do nothing
# 'Cause it's just what you must do
# Nobody does it anymore
# No I don't believe in the wasting of time,

# If you don't have a point to make
# Don't sweat it
# You'll make a sharp one being so kind

# I was staring out the window
# The whole time he was talking to me
# It was a filthy pane of glass
# I couldn't get a clear view
# As he went on and on
# It wasn't the outside world I could see
# Just the filthy pane that I was looking through
# So I had to break the window
# It just had to be
# Better that I break the window
# Than him or her or me
# I was never focused on just one thing
# My eyes got fixed when my mind got soft
# It may looked like I'm concentrated on a very clear view
# But I'm as good as asleep
# I bet you didn't know
# It takes a lot of it away if you do
# So I had to break the window
# It just had to be
# Better that I break the window
# Than him or her or me
# So I had to break the window
# It just had to be
# Better that I break the window
# Than him or her or me
# Because the fact in fact
# Whatever's in front of me is covering my view
# So I can't see what I'm seeing in fact
# I only see what I'm looking through
# I had to break the window
# It just had to be it was in my way
# Better that I break the window
# Then forget what I had to say
# So again I've done the right thing
# I was never worried about that
# The answer's always been in clear view
# But even when the window's clean
# I still can't see for the fact
# That when it's clean it's so clear
# I can't tell what I'm looking through
# So I had to break the window
# It just had to be
# Better that I break the window
# Than him or her or me
# I had to break the window
# It just had to be it was in my way
# Better that I break the window
# Then forget what I had to say
# I had to break the window
# It was in my way
# Better that I break a window
# Then forget what I had to say
# Or miss what I should see
# Or breaking him or her or me

# Igot home late on a Saturday night

# She took all I had but, left a hole in my heart
# Should've known it would go bad, right from the start
# -What did I do wrong?
# I can't understand why she would leave me this way
# -With nothing to say
# Then I found the note on the door
# It said good-bye and she don't want me no more
# "Bye bye baby, bye bye....", She said in her letter
# -And that was all she wrote
# Guess this is goodbye, guess this is forever
# -And that was all she wrote
# I called on the phone, but she wasn't there
# Should've know all along that she just didn't care
# -Why did she have to go?
# Now I look at her picture and I wonder why
# she left me this way...-Why did she say goodbye?
# -I guess I'll never know
# I can't understand why she would leave me this way

# Happy Birthday...so make a wish
# Verse 1:
# Please accept my apologies, wonder what would have been
# Would you've been a little angel or an angel of sin?
# Tom-boy running around, hanging with all the guys.
# Or a little tough boy with beautiful brown eyes?
# I payed for the murder before they determined the sex
# Choosing our life over your life meant your death
# And you never got a chance to even open your eyes
# Sometimes I wonder as a fetus if you faught for your life?
# Would you have been a little genius in love with math?
# Would you have played in your schoolclothes and made me mad?
# Would you have been a little rapper like your papa da Piper?
# Would you have made me quit smokin' by finding one of my lighters?
# I wonder about your skintone and shape of your nose?
# And the way you would have laughed and talked fast or slow?
# Think about it every year, so I picked up a pen
# Happy birthday, love you whoever you woulda been
# Happy birthday...
# Chorus:
# All I thought was a dream (make a wish)
# Was as real as it seemed (happy birthday)
# All I thought was a dream (make a wish)
# Was as real as it seemed
# I made a mistake
# Verse 2:
# I've got a millon excuses to why you died
# Bet the people got their own reasons for homicide
# Who's to say it woulda worked, and who's to say it wouldn't have?
# I was young and strugglin' but old enough to be your dad
# The fear of being a father has never disappeared
# Pondering frequently while I'm zippin' on my beer
# My vision of a family was artificial and fake
# So when it came time to create I made a mistake
# Now you've got a little brother maybe he's really you?
# Maybe you really forgave us knowin' we was confused?
# Maybe everytime that he smiles it's you proudly knowin' that your father's doin' the right thing now?
# I never tell a woman what to do with her body
# But if she don't love children then we can't party
# Think about it every year, so I picked up a pen
# Happy birthday, love you whoever you woulda been
# Happy birthday...
# Chorus:
# All I thought was a dream (make a wish)
# Was as real as it seemed (happy birthday)
# All I thought was a dream (yeah, make a wish)
# Was as real as it seemed
# I made a mistake
# And from the heavens to the womb to the heavens again
# From the endin' to the endin', never got to begin
# Maybe one day we could meet face to face?
# In a place without time and space
# Happy birthday...
# From the heavens to the womb to the heavens again
# From the endin' to the endin', never got to begin
# Maybe one day we could meet face to face?
# In a place without time and space
# Happy birthday...

# They tellin' me it's all good just wait
# You know you're gonna be there someday
# Sippin' on Jim Beam ok
# Gotta get these things one day

# Try to lie but it ain't me Ain't me
# Try to look but I can't see
# Can't stop right now cause I'm too far and I can't keep goin' cause it's too hard
# In the day in the night it's the same thing
# On the field on the block it's the same game
# On the real if you stop then it's no pain but if you can't feel pain then it's no gain
# Rearrange and you change and it's all bad and you try to maintain but you fall back
# And you crawl and you slip and you slide down
# Wanna make it to the top better start now
# So I hold my soul and I die hard
# All alone in the night in the graveyard
# Someday one day I'm gonna be free and they won't try to kill me for being me
# Hey someday
# [Chorus]
# Someday we gonna rise up on that wind you know
# Someday we gonna dance with those lions
# Someday we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'
# If you know how this is
# Gonna see it's not that easy
# Don't stop get it till it's done
# From where you are or have begun
# I said keep on try a little harder to see everything you need to be
# Believe in your dreams
# That you see when you're asleep
# [Chorus]
# Someday we gonna rise up on that wind you know
# Someday we gonna dance with those lions
# Someday we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'

# Ko za ?elje skrite ves
# In, ko v zarjo k soncu gre?
# In, ko cvetje oveni
# So oblaki erni zbrali se
# Nad goro objeli te
# Se reka je za hip postala, so srne jokale
# Se tudi ribie ni privzdignil, so ribe spavale
# Na mojih iluzijah mala, zagugaj se -
# Zagugaj se!
# Se najinih oprimi sreeanj
# Lepoto snemi z ?itnih polj
# Okleni klasja se naj zadehti
# Ko za ?elje skrite ves
# In, ko v zarjo k soncu gre?
# In, ko cvetje oveni.

# Don't ask me more questions, don't fuck with my head

# I've been down in this world, down and almost broken

# Oh mother of Jesus, I feel pretty ill
# I want to go home where my feet both feel safe
# But there ain't no jobs in the old free state
# So I must remain in my new adopted land
# I'm doing the best, Hell I'm doin' all I can
# So next time you see me, don't ask for my name

# Haunt the ground where it was I once tread
# On Grafton's Arcade pours the rich commerce rain
# Though the voices I no longer hear speak
# Heaven's to blame so on that I'll abstain
# Best clean the church from my cracked fingernail
# But don't let me die still wondering
# What it was I left behind
# From God's golden plate begrudgers they eat
# Till their belly's burst ignorance bliss
# Never they roam a wanderless home
# Is as far as their sorry eye sees
# Give me a rusty ol' goat wekk trampled and soaked
# Until these ashes abd blood mingle deep
# But don't let me die still wondering
# What it was I left behind
# Though I've been that face before
# Slammed every open door
# Squandered once scattered beliefs
# So when the waves come crashin' in
# I'll swim as the ocean swims
# Out with the morning tide
# Then back for my tea
# So I'll do as I please like the well-tempered breeze
# Blowin' which way I see fit
# I'll grey with the clay seven days till the day
# When they throw me on the potter's scrap heap
# But take my advice; you'll have to bury me twice
# Cause the first time I won't rest easily
# But don't let die still wondering
# What it was I left behind
# So don't let die still wondering
# What it was I left behind
# I want a rach well run ahead of the gun
# With a dance before the far finish line
# So no life long regrets, only well feathered steps
# Until these shoes I can longer shine

# And we'll never see the likes of you again
# No we'll never see the likes of you again
# There must be more to life, than this poxie life

# Hello, I've waited here for you, everlong
# Tonight, I throw myself into and out of the red, out of her head she sang
# Come down and waste away with me, down with me
# Slow how, you wanted it to be, I'm over my head, out of her head she sang
# And I wonder when I sing along with you if everything could ever feel this real forever
# If anything could ever be this good again
# The only thing I'll ever ask of you
# You've got to promise not to stop when I say when she sang
# Breathe out, so I can breathe you in, hold you in
# And now, I know you've always been out of your head, out of my head I sang
# And I wonder when I sing along with you if everything could ever feel this real forever
# If anything could ever be this good again
# The only thing I'll ever ask of you
# You've got to promise not to stop when I say when she sang
# [Spoken]
# Sometimes in life we wander aimlessly,
# Searching for a purpose, searching for ourselves.
# And yet, sometimes in life, we are so oblivious to the obvious
# Because everything is right in front of us
# And we're missing the point of living
# We're missing the point of living
# And I wonder if everything could ever feel this real forever
# If anything could ever be this good again

# uhh
# its kinda in the middle of the city

# second European tour
# and everything was going pretty good
# Skeeter, he met this girl that lived
# next door to Toss's
# and within a couple of weeks he started
# living with her, you know?
# and i guess she had a lot of money or something
# cause she was constantly buying him clothes
# and getting him lots of stuff and loading him
# with money, you know?
# He was constantly going to the coffee shop
# always getting the best herb and the best
# hash, you know?
# he was in good shape
# she was really good looking, she was
# really cool
# i, i don't think he'd ever met her before
# but she had, you know, other boyfriends i suppose
# so i'm sitting on the couch, you know, in
# Toss's apartment
# and im reading, you know, maximum rock and
# roll or flip side
# one of those punk things
# and i heard Skeeter come in
# and he came in and he had all these really
# nice clothes on
# she bought him all this stuff
# she like bought him cologne
# he was really really smelling good, you know
# he looked good too
# you know he came in and put his herb
# on the table and, whatever
# i'm just reading my little punk magazine
# not really paying attention
# and then he says, uh, he says hey dave
# and i look up
# and he's standing there with his dick
# in his hand
# and he's kinda got it like lifted up so
# he's looking at the head of his dick
# he kinda pointed it at me
# i didnt know what to think

# Damn the rap game done changed
# Everytime I turn around niggaz spittin' nigga's names

# When Big came and took the whole Brooklyn to fame
# Straight off of St. James
# Lookin' all Dapper Don, he threw a party and bullshit, it was on
# And, B.I.G. spot'll never be claimed
# 'Cuz Mrs. Wallace, Cease and Roc carry his name
# And later on in '96 when Hovi came and
# "Ain't No Nigga" was the key to his fame
# Introducin' a little Brooklyn girl by the name of Fox Brown
# About to shut this rap shit down and
# To the world we was Bonnie & Clyde
# And everything my nigga Jay said I'm ready to ride
# Then "I'll Be" came to skyrocket our fame
# And 2 million sales later bet I rode the same

# We snatched AZ and Mega and our team was born
# I took 'em on Puff tour, turn around Nas gone
# And the whole crew follow, what a hard pill to swallow and
# I had to thug it out and go in the zone
# And rock 30 thousand on my muhfuckin' own but
# I couldn't break down, I couldn't moan
# I got this Ill Na Na blood in my veins, I spar alone!
# Then 4 weeks later Puff ended at home at the Garden
# The show I came up on the throne
# See I...Can't believe my niggaz left me alone
# And I don't buy the shit about Puff was treatin' 'em wrong
# How the fuck we tryna pull weight on this man tour?
# At the time Puff 8 mil, the fuck you mad for?
# That's the problem wit niggaz, see they worse than broads
# Want a bitch to conceal they scars, yeah

# Depths of madness to unfold
# As my inner demons feed
# A battery that's charged inside
# Powering my redrum ride
# Dr. Jeckyll quickly turns to Hyde
# Now there's no blood left to bleed
# Born of anger
# Blinded by the rage that burns in me
# Born of anger
# Driving me insane I can't break free
# Stare into my lifeless eyes
# Feel the flames of hatred rise
# Fueled by my accuser's lies
# I'm a man without redemption
# On broken glass I walk alone
# A bed of nails I call my home
# Veins of ice and heart of stone
# A tribute to aggression
# Don't waste your time to understand me
# Psychoanalyze and pry just so you can brand me
# I am the child of hope that has died
# Twisting and turning with venom inside
# From this world I am freed only then you will see
# The monster you have made...
# Of me
# Solitude becomes my song
# Silence slowly screams along
# The choir's chorus heard so strong
# The symphony begins
# An impulse sent straight to my brain
# One false move against my grain
# Violence erupts again
# The madness always wins

# Conviction that builds with time
# I breathe life into my heart deceived
# Now the truth is of my design
# When your truth turns to lie
# And the pain makes you cry
# And the fountains of faith run dry
# Take a look at yourself
# And what you've sacrificed

# Avevano parlato a lungo

# della loro provvisorietà
# lei disse "Sta arrivando il giorno
# chiudi la finestra o il mattino ci scoprirà"
# e lui sentì crollare il mondo
# sentì che il tempo gli remava contro
# schiacciò la testa sul cuscino
# per non sentire il rumore di fondo della città
# Una tempesta d'estate
# lascia sabbia e calore
# e pezzi di conversazione nell'aria
# e ancora voglia d'amore
# lei chiese la parola d'ordine
# il codice d'ingresso al suo dolore
# lui disse "Non adesso,
# ne abbiamo già discusso troppo spesso
# aiutami piuttosto a far presto,
# il mio volo lo sai partirà tra poco più di due ore"
# Sentì suonare il telefono
# nella stanza gelata
# e si svegliò di colpo e capì
# di averla solo sognata
# si domandò con chi fosse e pensò
# "è acqua passata"
# e smise di cercare risposte,
# sentì che arrivava la tosse,
# si alzò per aprire le imposte

# Due buoni compagni di viaggio

# Mio fratello che studiava lingue misteriose,

# Come mazzi di rose

# Mamma chissà se valeva la pena
# fare tanta strada e arrivare qua
# la gente è la solita non cambia scena
# la stessa che ho lasciato tanto tempo fa.
# Hanno fame di soldi, hanno fame d'amore
# e corrono a cento all'ora
# i loro figli non somigliano a niente
# l'adolescenza subito li divora.
# Ma se potessi tornare indietro
# indietro io ci tornerei
# ma se potessi cominciare daccapo
# quello che ho fatto non lo rifarei.
# Ora c'è una ragazza di vent'anni che vive qua
# con lei dorme la notte
# e divido la notte e una notte forse lei mi sposerà.
# Ora c'è una miniera
# che ci danno mille l'ora per andare giù
# e quando usciamo inciampiamo nelle stelle perch? le stelle
# ormai quasi non le vediamo più.
# E meno male che c'è sempre qualcuno che canta
# e la tristezza ce la fa passare
# se no la nostra vita sarebbe come una barchetta
# in mezzo al mare
# dove tra la ragazza e la miniera
# apparentemente non c'è confine
# dove la vita è un lavoro a cottimo
# ed il cuore un cespuglio di spine.

# che esplodono
# Ancora in cerca d'autore
# Paese di uomini tutti d'un pezzo
# Che tutti hanno un prezzo

# Papaveri e vipere e papere
# dov'è finita la tua dolcezza

# E' chiusa a chiave dentro la tristezza
# dei buchi neri delle tue città
# Chissà se davvero esisteva una volta o se era una favola

# Era scomparsa nella mano

# E chissà se era mai esistita

# E restava la nostalgia
# E il guanto e la sua padrona
# Scivolavano via
# Il guanto e la sua padrona
# Pattinavano via
# Sotto un albero senza fiori
# Si struggeva l'amore amato
# Il guanto era a pochi passi
# Irraggiungibile e consumato
# In quella grande tempesta d'erba
# Non era estate n? primavera
# E non sembrava nemmeno autunno
# Però l'inverno non esisteva
# E non sembrava nemmeno autunno
# Perch? l'inverno non esisteva
# Quando un uomo da una piccola barca
# Con un mezzo marinaio
# Vide qualcosa biancheggiare
# Un uomo da una piccola barca
# Sporgendosi sul mare
# Era il guanto che rischiava di annegare
# Era il guanto che rischiava di affondare
# Fu un trionfo di conchiglie
# Un omaggio di fiori

# Alla banalità dei cuori
# A un spiaggia senza sabbia
# A una passione intravista
# A una gabbia senza chiave
# A una stanza senza vista
# A una gabbia senza chiave
# A una vita senza vista

# Rifluivano sul bagnasciuga
# E chissà se si può capire
# Che milioni di rose
# Non profumano mica
# Se non sono i tuoi fiori a fiorire
# Se i tuoi occhi non mi fanno più dormire
# Era la notte di quel brutto giorno
# I guanti erano sconfinati
# Come l'incubo di un assassino
# O i desideri dei condannati
# Dietro al Guanto Maggiore
# La luna era crescente
# E piccoli guanti
# Risalivano la corrente
# E piccoli guanti
# Risalivano la corrente
# Fino al Capo dei Sogni
# E alla Riva del Letto
# Dell'innocente che dormiva
# Un mostro sconosciuto
# Osservava non osservato
# Sopra un tavolo il guanto incriminato
# Sopra al tavolo un guanto immacolato
# Ed il guanto fu rapito
# In una notte d'inchiostro
# Dal quel mistero chiamato amore
# Da quell'amore che sembrava un mostro
# Inutilmente due nudi mani
# Si protesero a trattenerlo
# Il guanto era già nascosto
# Dove nessuno può più vederlo
# Il guanto era già lontano
# Quanto nessuno può più saperlo
# Oltre la pista di pattinaggio
# E le passioni al dì di festa
# E le onde di tutti i mari
# E il trionfo della tempesta
# E le rose nella schiuma
# Il guanto era volato
# Più alto della luna
# Il guanto era volato
# Più leggero di una piuma
# Oltre il luogo e l'azione
# Ed il tempo consentito
# E l'amore e le sue pene
# Il guanto si era già posato
# In quel quadro infinito

# Dentro gli occhi tuoi
# Parlami di come la fortuna aspetta
# E tienimi tra le tue braccia

# Dimmi che tu ci sarai

# Quando la malinconia
# Vestirà i ricordi
# Della vita mia
# Toglierò la polvere
# Laverò le lacrime
# Che tu

# È una poesia
# Che non ho sentito andare via
# Spiegami le cose che non ho capito
# E svegliami se senti freddo
# Vedi, sono qua

# Avrà ormai lasciato

# Dimmi che tu ci sarai

# Le cose che non voglio perdere
# Volti che non ho rivisto mai
# Le parole dette e poi

# I've got you under my skin?
# I'd sacrifice anything come what might
# For the sake of havin' you near
# In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
# And repeats, repeats in my ear:
# Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
# Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
# But each time that I do just the thought of you
# Makes me stop before I begin
# 'Cause I've got you under my skin.

# Why not use your mentality - step up, wake up to reality?

# The tables are empty - the dance floor's deserted

# The cigarettes you light - one after another
# Won't help you forget her - and the way that you love her
# You're only burning - a torch you can't lose
# But you're on the right track - for learnin' the blues
# When you're at home alone, the blues will taunt you - constantly
# When you're out in a crowd, the blues will haunt your memory
# The nights when you don't sleep - the whole night you're crying
# You just can't forget her - soon you even stop trying

# and now, the end is near;

# Regrets, i've had a few;

# I ate it up and spit it out.

# And did it my way.
# I've loved, i've laughed and cried.

# And now, as tears subside,
# I find it all so amusing.
# To think i did all that;
# And may i say - not in a shy way,
# "no, oh no not me,
# I did it my way".
# For what is a man, what has he got?
# If not himself, then he has naught.

# then she's old enough to give her heart away
# when a girl changes from bobby sox to stockings
# and she starts trading her baby toys for boys
# when that once-shy little sleepyhead
# learns about love and its lilt
# you can bet that the change

# I know that it's kinda crazy
# But I feel like I'm falling apart
# Usually I'm cool, but I lost it when
# She walked away
# Lost without her...and she's gone
# Gone...gone...gone
# Don't think she's ever coming back
# It's killing me
# That I let her heart down completely
# I should've gave her all of me
# She's gone
# Gone...gone...gone
# She ain't even thinkin' 'bout me honestly
# Being strong to carry on ain't easy
# Gotta face it she's gone...gone
# Without some kind of intervention
# I can't go on another day...oh
# And I can't even bare to mention
# The very sound of her name
# Without the sky turnin into clouds
# Without the rain falling down
# Falling down...again...again
# I can't face the fact that she's gone
# Gone...gone...gone
# Don't think she's ever coming back
# It's killing me
# That I let her heart down completely

# do i live my life with you as my wife
# or do i go on and pursue my lifetime dream
# i gotta do this for me

# but if i dont i'll probably regret it
# how i cope
# CHORUS:
# how do you cope when
# the one you love is with somebody else
# and theres nothin you could do about it
# how do you deal with
# the fact that you had a chance
# but you chose to turn away for your career
# i gotta take it though its heart breakin
# its somethin that i had to do
# but nobody said that it would hurt so bad
# so how do i live... and how do i deal
# without you
# 2nd Verse
# its killing me to know

# At ang nanay at tatay mo'y
# 'Di malaman ang gagawin
# Minamasdan pati pagtulog mo.
# At sa gabi'y napupuyat ang iyong nanay
# Sa pagtimpla ng gatas mo
# At sa umaga nama'y kalong ka ng iyong amang
# Tuwang-tuwa sa iyo.
# Ngayon ng malaki ka na
# Nais mo'y maging malaya
# 'Di man sila payag walang magagawa
# Ikaw nga ay biglang nagbago
# Naging matigas ang iyong ulo
# At ang payo nila'y sinuway mo.
# Di mo man lang inisip na
# Ang kanilang ginagawa'y para sa iyo
# 'Pagkat ang nais mo'y masunod ang layaw mo
# "Di mo sila pinapansin.
# Nagdaan pa ang mga araw
# At ang landas mo'y naligaw
# Ikaw ay nalulong sa masamang bisyo
# At ang una mong nilapitan
# Ang iyong inang lumuluha
# At ang tanong "Anak, ba't ka nagkaganyan?"
# Pagsisisi at sa isip mo'y nalaman mong
# Ikaw'y nagkamali.
# Pagsisisi at sa isip mo'y nalaman mong
# Ikaw'y nagkamali.

# I see you're true colors shinning through I see your true colors and that why I love you
# I see your (one for the ghetto) true colors shinning through (straight up) I see your true (I am make it out) colors and that's why I love you…
# Yo father forgive we all trying to survive were we live
# I'd rather feed the homeless and take time talk to the kids
# Show them that life ain't no walk on the bridge
# Damn as hard it is when I be dreaming I be talking to Big
# In my hood it ain't no yellow brick road you hear the shots echo
# Sneakers hanging from a telephone poll
# In my ghetto there aint no rainbow or pots o gold
# But there was love from the family when times were cold
# I sit an analyze the world from my roof seen the hope in the eyes of the trouble youth
# A good killa kept a burner in his bubble goose a mother less child lost in these streets lose
# In the murder days these are rainy days my man got poped at an early age
# His college fund saved flipped into his grave they say the good die young were headed for them pearly gates
# I see you're true colors shinning through I see your true colors and that why I love you
# I see your true colors shinning through I see your true colors and that's why I love you…
# Yo they say this love wasn't meant to be
# Two people from different worlds we wasn't be
# It must have been faith you were sent to me
# Will make it threw these hard times eventually
# The standard fight brought by faith not by sight
# We all the same color when u turn out the lights
# I take the sunshine with the pain
# Grab my Sara gone sad that when it rains
# No French kept the food on the window pain
# We all breath the same air so we all the same
# I am trapped in this ghetto maze trying to make it out
# If you don't know me don't judge me what you talking bout
# I am dividable by broken dreams
# Single moms you my heroes you my queens
# To get my mom out the hood that is my hopes and dreams
# to reach my son to be a solja by any means
# I see you're true colors shinning through I see your true colors and that why I love you
# I see your true colors shinning through I see your true colors and that's why I love you…

# Stara ti je dozivjela slom
# i u bolnicu odvedena
# a tvoj stari se na sahrani
# na mene dere
# Sto te nisam pazio
# ja sam tek to shvatio
# kad sam sliku u dzep stavio
# sad ti gledam sliku
# I sjecam se kad smo pili
# prvi put travu pusili
# i govorili jebo hemiju
# treb'o si mi biti kum
# dvije glave, jedan um
# Prije sam mog'o puno vise
# uticat' na tebe
# a sad listam proslo vrijeme
# gledam gdje smo pali
# Ali nema, buraz, jedno poglavlje
# u toj prici fali
# prije smo se talili za albume nove
# onda si se talio za bobe
# I rok'o tramale kod rodje
# i non stop si zvao mene
# na rave party da dodjem
# kako pomoc drugom
# ako tim putem podje
# Nikad se nisam fur'o na ulogu vodje
# al' kod tebe sam fakat
# jedno vrijeme mozda cak i treb'o
# primjetio sam jer si me drugacije gled'o
# Nisi k'o prije se zez'o
# al' mi nisi nikad nista rek'o
# mozda si me tako
# ustvari upomoc zvao
# al' ja to nisam znao
# Samo da si mi jedan znak dao
# i onu jaknu kad si prod'o
# ja sam kasnije skont'o zasto
# im'o si dug kod dilera
# on ti nije prast'o
# One price o skidanju
# sad znam da si mast'o
# prije sam ti vjerov'o
# a kasnije si me samo lag'o
# Jedan bez drugog prije nije nigdje mako
# kasnije si furo s kim si stig'o
# i gdje god si lovu dig'o
# Sve si s nekim lafo jaranima
# na gadro spicko
# govorio si kako su ti oni pravi jarani
# al' svako je vidio
# da je to interes ustvari
# De mi, Frenkie, cenera pozajmi
# sutra navrati
# i jebo mater ako ti ja to sve
# sutra odmah ne vratim
# najkasnije tad
# Sve sam treb'o znat'
# al' nisam mog'o vjerovat'
# sad se osjecam krivim
# ne mogu da se pomirim
# i taj gubitak da primim
# Da sam te bar
# kod tvojih roditelja izd'o
# kad si onog taksistu
# zbog onih par maraka izb'o
# I onaj nakit kad si
# onog dana od stare ukr'o
# skont'o sam da si preduboko
# u to sranje up'o
# Sitnice bude u meni
# one lude slike stare
# zajednicke gide i upute tvoje
# kak' se cure bare
# I tvoj mladji brat
# na tebe sad pravo lici
# nekad kad ga vidim
# zovem ga imenom tvojim
# Al' za njega se ne bojim
# on nece tvojim putem ici
# svaki dan na trening pici
# s tim ce jos daleko stici
# Bice pravi jebac
# k'o sto smo uvijek govorili
# mi smo se za trebe borili
# a njemu dolaze sad same
# i to ne one glupace k'o nama
# nego prave dame
# I uvijek kad ga vidim
# jako k'o tebe ga grlim
# stara ti od onog dana
# nije bas vise ista
# I dalje ti je soba cista
# nikom ne da da dira ista
# uvijek pita neka tvoja
# stara majica kod mene
# Jer treba da bude sve cisto
# i spremno za tebe
# uvijek se jezim
# kad s njom u istoj sobi sjedim
# A brat svaki dan
# cvrsto grli i ljubi nju
# a ona prica s tobom
# k'o da si za stolom tu
# I uvijek kaze, Frenkie, vrati majicu
# nemoj da bi zaboravio
# stari ti se popravio
# i on je dosta propatio
# Al' ozdravio je
# na kraju svega fino se oporavio
# cesto nazove, pita, trebal' mi love
# zeza za siroke tole
# glumi neke reperske fore
# Znas, bolan, kako nas je
# uvijek zez'o prije
# samo sad sto mu osmijeh
# na licu isti nije
# Nedostajes mi, brate
# neki ne mogu da shvate
# kako tuga tol'ko traje
# i zasto ne zivim vise dalje
# Jarane, ne mogu
# k'o da si mi iscup'o nogu
# s tobom umro je i dio mene
# a onaj drugi vene
# Sto nastupa sam tebi posvetio
# nadam se da sam se barem malo
# promjenio i opametio
# nisam znao da mi droga
# moze druga otet'
# Znam, sad ne mogu
# vratit' vrijeme i ispocetka pocet'
# al' navece kad legnem da spavam
# vidim te opet i opet

# ti ostanu lijepi snovi

# I thought I could get over you

# I looked around my car...no way
# Because your cigarettes are in my back seat
# And I can't get very far listening to the CD mix you made me
# There's your lipstick on my floorboard
# Your footprints on the dashboard
# You're everywhere but by my side
# And I can't drive

# Who threw the party
# Where we finished all the alcohol
# And passed out on the lawn

# Hey what about the promise that you made to me
# That we'd always be together and you'd be there

# Sometimes I pray it would not last
# While lying on the floor with broken chest;
# Self denial sharp as razor blade;
# Sitting on the throne of fear
# Feeling so depraved;
# I took off my skin to repair my self
# To rise above my broken former self;
# I'm rising high now I can scent your breath
# I'm breaking the chains and caping this game of pain;
# Watching the flames engulfing me, licking worms of demise
# Chewing my bones, my memories
# Foul creature in disguise
# Why is it so hard for me to see the right destinity
# I had a dream once, I had a dream in my mind...

# Your rigid mind will bring me down
# Crawling, bending, mold is grownig, red river...blood is flowing
# I'll show you things you won't deny
# One day I'll reshape, dark world around me as a better place
# No more living in a dream, mesmorised old memories
# I'll build myself a place, new dimension of qualities
# There I'll plant a seed of ash and be reborn for you
# I'm on the roll
# The phoenix has risen from ashes today
# Now I'm going home, I'm gonna be whole again
# I'm going home, I'm gonna feel the wormth again

# Hell On Wheels is no big deal
# Takin' 'em out of the Masterplan
# An idea whose time has come
# A land ride for everyone
# Been like this for years on end
# We'll let you know where and when
# As he splits the road in two
# Underdrive we never knew
# Ourun 'em you know we can
# So put the keys in my hand
# In my hand
# Chorus
# In my hand (8x)
> Fu Manchu
# 3 weeks after!
# made a discovery
# it was linked with
# I had witnessed..
# refused to admit
# rumor of the voice say..
# jolted down the broadcast
# Second Time today
# (chorus)
# dealin with the hogwash
# as you know (2x)
# flyin through this trail
# a blue rain fell
# just before daybreak
# It was a huge mistake
# so around midday
# or so they say
# a close escape..
# on our way
# (chorus 4x)
> Fu Manchu
# In the old days - I seen 'em come and go
# Built on a huge fort - that much I know
# Maybe a good deal - hard to find
# Location unknown - again this time
# Chorus: Keepin' the road clear
# Hang at the back
# Old Miss River
# We see at last
# Invisible
# Has seen it fall
# And 10 times over
# That ain't all
# Eliminate - and move on through
# Learn from the master - like we knew
# Early morning hour - time drew close
# Over the top - that much we know
# Chorus
# Again they roll on and on
# Hotdoggin' (4x)
> Fu Manchu
# The universal eyes tell me where to go
# White line movin' slow
# Million miles an hour headfirst and alone
# All I got is tuck and roll
# All through my head
# It's happenin' over again
# Under forty over is U.F.O.
# Hell bent stacked in rows
# The galaxy is lined with hundreds more
# Small town you bet we're sure
# All through my head
# It's happenin' over again
# As the day is long They keep movin' on
# Laughin' at the notion of a signal light
# Knew we'd gone too far
# No one knew what happened but it seemed alright
# We quickly jumped in the car
# All through my head It's happenin' over again
# King of the Road says you move too slow!
> Fu Manchu
# The almighty hand in sight
# been shown it from time to time
# and life exists for the chosen few
# they return showing what to do
# Invisible to the human eye

# your closing in never knowing the truth
# search light blinds... now what do we do?
# angel hair fell made the news
# The ends in sight.. they never knew!

# Man made way uknown..change course.. back to home

# By now the controller knew..full power chased by two
# No one in the room could tell... a wild story yea ohwell
# For a moment things went calm..no need to sound the alarm
# The controller gave the word...planes vanish is what we heard
# Did it happen like he said.. better find out instead
# Rolling back in time..short notice.. but we'll try
# Will they ever show..Orbiter lays low
# Next morning we arrived on site.. had a feelin something aint right
# Soon as the car door slammed.. Hemi's keys were in my hand
# Blown heads on a six fifty four (654) All right now we need one more
# Orbiter is close at hand.. we all agreed on a skyward plan
# Will they ever show.. Orbiter lays low
# So now months passed us by.. we're sure it was all a lie
# Sun mirror was placed on high.. will let us know over time
# First step to another world..is from years gone by were sure

# Keep it centered - keep it low
# Keep it runnin' - let's go
# Watch it climb - on its own
# The more we see - the more we know
# We know
# Four wheels and a lift
# What we gave - we get
# The convoy was down
# There was nothing left - no one around
# We strapped ourselves in tight
# We were the first - and we're alright
# It's movin' way too fast
# Now shut the doors - and hit the gas
# Chorus: Soo over the edge
# They said (2x)
# I lift my head I soon realized
# I remembered - back in time
# What was rollin' along
# Movin' circle - on and on
# An image so small
# We heard the word - we heard the call
# Let's keep our story straight
# It doesn't matter - it's way too late

# Wrong place and the right time
# Ride high and low
# Left for good
# We'll never know
# Can you see by the tracks left
# Dust settles slow
# So we all bow down
# PIGEON TOE!
# First few were a get down
# Fast times and all
# So out of nowhere
# They began to haul
# Rollin through the flatlands
# End of day
# It too bolts upright
# Or so they say

# Like so with gasolene
# On more we ever been
# Went back another day
# Off the road..we never made
# Mola sinnin until before
# Between the lines..readin more
# Across the field with little known
# It's what they said get in it and go!
# Accelerate ..to the floor
# Observe the light .. observe the 4
# 1000 feet had passed us by
# Make up the time .. we have to try
# Motionless .. and revived
# Up above .. a blinding light
# Once again .. a different route
# Give us the time .. we'll find it out
# (chorus)
# It's been hidden away .. for 50 years
# So says the four .. so says the four  (so says the ball.. is what I thought)
# At first they were cleared .. until the 4
# Had gained control .. had gained control
# (Bob Balch rocks some ass)
# A certain sign just like we found
# It's what we see .. it's what went down
# Urethane has given way
# Breakin' down .. just like they say

# A cover up .. is what we knew
# No time to check the facts
# Never told ... we'd make it back!

# Every night at sunrise.. bright lights shinnin in my eyes

# Dear friends of this, I cannot be..
# Oh, Romeo is bleeding to death..
# 'Til, secretly, to death,
# Not more than some kind of metaphor
# That I can't see..
# So I'll drink until I see it.
# I can't see, so I'll drink until I'll see it.
# This sky will make me sick,
# So I'll give up on you,
# I'll give up on this.
# This sky will make me sick,
# So I'll give up on this,
# I'll give up on you.
# Archers in your arches,
# Raise your fingers for one last salute..
# I'll bleed this skyline dry,
# Until your history is mine.
# So you want to hold me up and bring me down?
# Yes, you want to hold me up and break me down..
# But I don't care for your sweet scent
# Or the way you want me more than I want you.
# I don't care for your sweet scent,
# Or the way you want me more than I want you.
# It's all mine.. it's all mine..
> Funeral For A Friend
# Just to say we're sorry,
# For the black eyes and bleeding lips.
# When it's hard to forget
# How many lies we've told.
# Oh, how we go,
# Before I said goodbye.
# So let's scrape our knees on the playground.
# It's not your fault,
# You feel okay.
# It's too late in the day.
# It's not your fault,
# You feel betrayed.
# You can't come out to play.
# I never listened to a word you never said.
# I never listened to a word you never said.
# Wasting the hours now,
# We're all suckers for tragedies.
# We'll start things over again,
# And you'll bring us to our knees.
# When sunrise comes,
# And the story will sell,
# There'll be a hundred papers,
# So we'll fight all you want.
# It's not your fault,
# You feel okay.
# It's too late in the day.
# It's not your fault,
# You feel betrayed.
# You can't come out to play.
# I never listened to a word you never said.
# I never listened to a word you never said.
# So raise your hands up high
# And let this rain pour.
# So raise your hands up high
# And wash us away.
# We still have got each other.
# You look just like your mother.
# You look just like your father.
# Forgive me, my father,
# The sun is smiling,
# So let roses be red?

# Till you're trying to find the you that you once had
# I have heard myself cry, never again
# Broken down in agony just tryna find a friend
# Oh Oh

# Up high
# Nothing can touch me
# But why do I feel this party's over?
# No pain

# I hear my name,

# In your sleep, the secrets that you're keeping,
# A chick, this smart
# Did you really think you could keep her in the dark?
# Does she purr?
# Does she make it hard
# Hard to speak?
# Does she dress the part?
# I'm sure she'll take some getting used to,
# Brother she will never be me
# Feel the burn, take a spin,
# Suck the poison out of me,
# I'll make your beg, I'll make your come,
# To your senses if you keep,
# Up the shit, take the hit,

# This is how it goes down,
# This is how it goes down
# Gonna run, gonna scream,
# Gonna crawl down on your knees,
# When you realize that no one's gonna measure up to me,
# Doesn't matter cause I'm over it now,
# This is how it goes down,
# This is how it goes down,
# I'm gonna rage,
# Stay out really late,
# Gonna hang, with all my friends you hate,
# I may try that three-some,
# Better late than never,
# And better without you,
# This is your future as I see it,
# You will be homeless, bald and broken,
# She will have left you when she finds out who you are,
# You're nothing but an extra, and baby I'm the star,
# [Chorus 1x]
# [Rap:]
# Suppose this is how the story goes but ever since that door closed,
# I've been going down (down), the dream, in the pink got me nausious,
# I should've grown more cautious, and clever, whatever
# you never find a dude with better head game and,
# You can take that both ways,
# You laughing like I'm playing with your fingers up like OJ,
# Missy you would have a three-some without me,
# I'll pull an OJ, and text you some incriminating pictures from my old days,
# [Chorus 1x]
# Somebody done lied to you
# Because you're not such a big shot dude,
# You might wanna rethink it through,
# You should've asked me I would've told you the truth,
