# Baby dont understand why we just cant hold on to each others hands
# this time might be the last I fear unless I make it all to clear
# I need you so ... can't let you go ... noo oh

# learn to live so free and when we hear the voices sing
# the book of love will open up and let us in
# take these broken wings ...

# and make it right ... cause baby it's all i know
# that your half of the flesh and blood that makes me whole

# verse 1
# All I can do
# Is sit alone
# In my room
# Thinking about you
# How could it be
# That you are not here with me
# When I gave you the best of me
# I face each day
# Without a smile
# And life seems so unfair
# I feel like I wanna die
# Cause you didn't even give me a last
# You didn't even give me a last goodbye
# chorus
# I've waited weeks for your call
# I've waited here by the phone
# But when the silence grew long
# I knew that something was wrong
# Right then I knew it babe
# How could you do it babe
# How could you tear my poor heart in two
# How could you do it babe
# Do it, do it, do it babe
# How could you do it babe
# And tear my poor heart in two
# verse 2
# Ain't no more blue up in my sky
# Only cloudy mornings
# And these tears like rain you left behind
# All of those memories
# In the corner of my mind
# I started looking at us
# At a picture in a frame
# As I start to cry
# Cause I can't picture us apart
# Oh my God can you help me
# Can you help me with this pain
# With this pain I'm feeling deep down inside

# It's 3 o'clock and you're still not home
# You're already 2 hours late
# I gave you the benefit of the doubt
# But babygirl, you always disappoint me
# And lately, you've been bringin' home
# The smell that you're wearin'
# Is not my cologne

# The other night, I couldn't fall asleep
# I heard you whisper his name, in your dreams
# What kinda man would I be to stay
# There ain't no question
# I got to leave

# I did the best that I could for you, babe
# But I guess the best wasn't good enough for you
# How could you let him break up our happy happy home

# But I'm a firm believer
# In trusting, caring, and loving
# My love for you is so timeless
# It's deeper then the depth of emotion
# And every day goes by, I am finding

# All around my home town
# They try to chop me down
# But the truth shall not forsake me
# Take me up to higher grounds
# And ooohh-hoooo

# We've just landed

# These humans are crazy
# Just don't even show them your micrpphone

# We love hip hop
# Stop, please stop please
# Okay here we go
# [Verse 1]
# Holding my raps
# Olden is golden and black
# Extolling virtues of rap
# With monkeys riding my back
# I see them falling
# Doing commercials and balling
# I'm not a hater but she's closing the gate
# And we stalling
# Woke up in the early morning
# I heard a voice that showed me the things to come
# And told me I had a choice
# To build it 300 cubits by 50 cubits
# Driking thinking I'm stupid but deep in my heart I knew it
# Money and fame could lead to emcee murder
# You think you can escape but you can't take it any further
# You call it writer's block
# But you stop cause the vine is empty
# Hip hop's not dead, it's really the mind of the emcee
# It's all around me
# It's emcee murder
# Though God has found me
# I thought I heard the
# Sound of a thousand angels
# It's the sound of danger
# Know myself but I'm still a stranger
# Emcee murder, emcee murder (oh)
# [Verse 2]
# I'll be damned if I do
# And damned if I don't
# My soul won't allow me to fake on the phone
# Rocking the chrome
# Another seed gets sown
# Anonymous, I'm hailin from parts that's unknown
# I looked to the heavens above to spread love
# But emcees keep faking hoping to make the bacon
# Matters mistaken, cause who we are is not physical
# Bury mystical with the mind non typical
# But, they want the cash flow
# They steady scheming for the number one spot
# These emcees they won't last though
# I really feel somebody's watching me
# From the third the star and telling us who we are
# In this universe we like a speck of dust
# You can't expect to trust man is living for the lust
# Everbody wants the eye in the sky to come and save us
# But maybe, the planet itself will terminate us with the

# Yo, uh uh uh uh uh
# This is the mission out a small time thing
# Let me tell you bout what happened when the phone went
# I was chillin' at the crib with this girl named Wise
# She was kissin' my brain, caressin' my third eye
# When the phone rang, I couldn't believe it
# Told myself to forget it, ignore it, leave it
# But just when things started goin' great
# It rang again, I said hold up, wait
# Picked up the phone, 'Yeah who the hell is this?'
# Somebody said, 'This is serious business
# Hip hop is dyin' it's all Darth Vader
# So pick up your mic and swing your light sabre.'
# The Skywalker, the fly talker from the T-dot
# We got, beats and lyrics to get you up
# Kick in the door, wavin' my ASR
# Who got my back? In fact it's Figure Four
# I keep it raw, cross the city just like gore
# Rappers are claimin' to be hardcore
# But never no more
# (Chorus: K-OS)
# Some just lost, they floss they don't get it
# When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
# If you love this life I know you'll get with it
# Cause all in all it's fantastique
# Some just lost, they floss they don't get it
# When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
# If you love this life I know you'll get with it
# Cause all in all it's fantastique

# There's only two digits; zero and number one
# But some get fooled by countin' bullets in a gun
# I make a run, with that renegade Red 1
# We so close you can figure us cousins
# So step up if you want to get taxed
# Hip hop used to be black, but now it laxed
# The brick cause they mostly spit like demonology
# My psychology not dependant on pimpology
# Cause pimps just react to things, men make em happen
# This rappin' dedicated to soul clappin'
# If you got soul, than The Infinite's in control
# Stop using mine, people to legitimize
# Youself cause you raped the Earth and tell lies
# My man positive intelligent and wise
# I don't suck energy son, I energize
# This is dedicated to make it live, bring it back

# Positivity, that's my man
# And to the one Godzillah, understands
# The deep, Cole got the beat
# And to the one that fit, is for the street
# And contents of the Pressure
# Knows the deal, and to the girl, Victory
# You make me feel, but my man John Salle'
# We keep it down, Figure Four kinda love
# I pull out the mic, and shock MC's for spite
# Whatever I write, magnifies heavenly sight
# You said you shinin', but that really means you reflect
# I absorb light within my pores and then connect
# With the righteous one, he told me son, 'Forget it
# Live your life for the truth don't anyone ever let it.'
# Shed often, trapped on the Earth light walkin'
# I meditate day to day so I can stay on the right path
# How many know just what I'm feelin'?
# The Eart keep revealin' songs you can't sing
# To the non-believers, deceivers that can't see this
# They blind to the fact but I can't relax
# I keep runnin' see the light towards the sun and
# They keep shunnin', but I bow my head to The One and
# I can't lie, so you for it, I want to fly
# Up to the heavenly hills where love chills

# He told me, 'Son, follow me
# And I will come to.'
# He told me, 'Son, follow me

# My method is wild, original style
# Acoustic, some'll refuse it
# Cause they don't know the real
# The Seventh Seal, is broken so I be smokin'
# On these whack rappers, cause they never knew the time
# Easy to find, out the way things are
# But how it's supposed to be is to far
# For your mind to grasp so you follow the mass
# Playin' the role of a mack, but deep inside the mack knows
# The spirit is under attack, and I lead the war
# With my battalion, lyrical stallion, riding
# Dividing the sheep from the golden lyrical quote
# If not you could get smoked, by the mind is sore genius
# I mean this I guarantee you never seen this before
# Rappin' over guitars and finger snaps
# My rapid raps, open a whole fire bun
# He told me son, so check it out
# (Chorus: K-OS)
# (Red 1)
# Yo, my war's against the foundation
# Of a global united nation
# When humans rule the world
# By the codes of free mason
# Hallucinated, by the quest for domination
# An equation, which equals the battle station
# Ready to bust, capture and crush
# Move a nine of us, stealth style rebellious
# Prefer profile, cause the beast is hideous
# So move agile, seek the facts and compile
# More wisdom, smokin' isms
# That your knowledge and your children
# Give thanks and it has nothin' to do
# With the f***in' Pilgrims
# Startin' the curriculum, the Devil wants to be Ichiban
# Interception is how this is done
# But by the locks of the dreaded don aka Red 1
# We'll emerge the champion cause the war is on
# So grab your Teflon, your muskets and your swords
# And peace love and unity will be your reward

# Yo, yo what the f***, yo, yo
# (Chorus: K-OS)
# It goes stop, don't make a move, just freeze
# Instead of tellin' a lie, get down on your knees
# Please, give up the mic to MC's
# Masters of the ceremony, is what we be
# It goes stop, don't make a move, just freeze
# Instead of tellin' a lie, get down on your knees
# Please, give up the mic to MC's
# Masters of the ceremony, is what we be.
# (K-OS)
# I was walkin' down the street about three o'clock
# When I saw another MC at the end of the block
# Talkin' to kids tellin' em, how they had to get the dough
# So I rolled right up in the Cypher and said 'Yo!'
# Here is an example of a whack MC
# Caught in the world and he just can't see
# He said, 'What? Aiyyo, you disrespectin' me?
# Now I got to battle you and show them who the best be.'
# He started spittin', he said, 'Somethin' somethin' hot.'
# Then he tried to talk about the money that he got
# I said, 'Shhh c'mon yo, that's all passé.
# I got to break it down another way like this now.
# Follow me here in this moment and time
# Follow the rhyme created instigated to see the crime
# You commit, when you sit in the past. Don't you know?
# You construct a future based on everything that you know.
# But to get to the unknown, we surely must erase
# All the preconceived notions they keep throwin' up in our face
# On the daily. I run over tracks like Donavan Bailey
# And break every record, in less than ten seconds.'
# They said, 'Oooooh! That's a real metaphysical.
# We pull down the light cause the force is centrifugal'
# He tried to act up I had to give in
# Because the truth is an offense and not a sin, word life.
# (Chorus: K-OS)
# (K-OS)
# MC's ain't comin' equipped, with the rhyme
# Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
# The time is essential when you play with the lives of the youth
# They want the truth, but you want loot
# So ya change a little bit switch up your steeds
# Now you got a bigger bag and countin' extra ki's
# Please, everything you do we do with these
# Real MC's are universal entities, that
# Scope the universe lookin' for the fraudulence
# Then we take a disguise like Clark Kent
# My manner would have quick to check a scanner
# For a weak MC sinkin' a city like Atlantis
# You can't stand this, missile placed and you vanish
# I meditate delevitate the twelve planets
# You cannot withstand the heavy verbal attack
# I'm the lyrical master blaster yeah I can do that
# I can also be your style, because I analyzed it
# You used to rock, but now you paralyzed it
# Doesn't really matter like platinum blondes
# Think what is an MC if he can't drop bombs
# Don't really matter if it's over your head
# Cause the job of resurrectin' is to wake up the dead
# So pay attention it's the hard to behold
# That everything that good it ain't gold, for real.
# (Chorus: K-OS) x2 1/2
> K-Os
# Turn this up (x2)
# Yo uh-huh
# Yes no no no beat yeah no no no beat
# Bring it (x2)

# Heaven only knows, cause I don't understand (understand now)
# Won't you tell me please (tell me) what's the master plan (master plan)
# Spend so many days (many days), sitting on a cloud (sitting on a cloud)
# Heaven only knows (only God knows), so I'll just move the crowd
# Now I break out of my physical shell and exhale past this so called body
# Used to go to the party, but now I sit and chill with a pen and a pad
# Dropping ill philosophical science me and my dad, we talk about life and how it started
# How we departed from life's path and probable right math
# The task at hand is making people understand that were not who we think we are
# But in this land of the lost the cost of souls could be so high
# People be gettin high, wondering why we die
# But it's all planned, forget your fear take the hand
# We keep on returning cause the lessons need learning
# Concerning (what) fact I sing and I rap, I hold this mic contact
# Critics can step back and analyze, I energize, cosmic rays of days the igno
# (??) for the sun
# (Chorus)
# Heaven only knows, cause I don't understand (don't understand)
# Won't you tell me please (cause I pray everyday) what's the master plan (the master plan)
# Spend so many days (many days), sitting on a cloud (sitting on a cloud)
# Heaven only knows (only God knows), so I'll just move the crowd
# So uh riddle me this, riddle me this like this
# Melodical prodigal flows, hypnotical blows to brain pieces (ooh)
# Telekinesis (ahh) when I reach this pinnacle, cynical, clinical
# Microphone autobots, waiting on lotto spots, trying to rock
# But yo they can't understand, there's only one plan
# The time is at hand, in the year two zero one one
# The people of the sun return to save the righteous children
# Now, I know you wanna be on top of the world
# Giving a diamond and pearl to your girl
# Watching your jacuzzi swirl (uh), seems like material lust
# We need to look up to the heavens for imperial trust (me)
# It's kinda hard you rhyme sometimes everybody wants to scrutinize
# Redefine who you are, but every person is a star
# So let your light shine far, and praise god
# (Chorus)
# Heaven only knows (only knows now), cause I don't understand (don't understand now)
# Won't you tell me please (tell me please) what's the master plan (I wanna know the plan)
# Spend so many days (many days), sitting on a cloud (sitting on a cloud)
# Heaven only knows (yo if you feel this sing it wit me now), so I'll just move the crowd
# La la la la la la la la la la I'll just move the crowd for now (gotta move the crowd (x3)
# La la la la la la la la la la (la la) I'll just move the crowd for now
# Somebody told me they said uh
# If you free them (uh huh) they will start revolution and Babylon can not defeat them
# (right yo)
# And they don't want that (x3)
# If you free them (free them) they will start revolution (uh huh)
# and Babylon can not defeat them (mind revolution (x2))
# And so uh huh huh, my sister (??)

# I tried it, I couldn't find it
# Now I just wanna get back to me
# Awe baby, hoo hoo
# Back into the man I used to be

# Things that I said I wouldn't do, I did 'em
# Secrets below the service of truth I hid 'em
# This mankind is past, but can he erase
# The tears of a million years is human race
# Of animals, that taught to walk upright
# Then slave all day and fall in a trance at night
# Flowing the planet, trying to find missing links
# Like the men we used to be and always suppose to think
# Mysteries, maybe not
# It's getting hot, we better configure the plot, but
# I hold a pen with the grip so tight
# That'a squeeze the ink out'ta the page, and write a song for the people
# Came up from the underground, now I write above on a hovercraft sound
# This microphone, like an an amphetamine
# Keeping me clean, speaking in dreams
# So nature can intervene, just for a scene
# [Verse 2]
# I walk the long path alone, my feet hurt
# Lost some friends along the way, I did dirt
# I went to church, I tried everything
# From leaving my body, to watching the birds sing
# For hours, so I could feel heavenly powers
# Had been across the universe and inside of flowers
# But what is it worth, i'm still just a man on the earth

# So I sit back, planning my great escape
# Load up my EPS and peruse my record crate
# The man I used to be, I can only see by looking beyone me
# So what is reality, I don't know
# Oops, wrong song, stop it stop it
# You know what
# I woke up in the morning
# I took a trip to the corner store
# That's when I heard my calling
# But i'd never heard the voice of truth before
# So I kept on walking
# Pretended I didn't see
# Walked by a window and my reflection said to me
# You could try all the same
# But you'll never know this mystery
# There's no pile on your plane
# So you're not the man you used to be
# Try all the game, but you'll never know this mystery
# When your pile has no plane
# Said you're the man you used to be seen
# Holla and ya holla, you folla you fall
# Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
# Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
# Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
# Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
# Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
# Yo, microphones get ripped holding us back

# In this venture, nothing gained
# I've only just touched the surface
# Once nervous, when writing for a worthless purpose
# It was once more than this, before the heart left the beat
# The soul left the speech, I'm still trying to reach
# My niche, and teach the love again
# Inside the hate of a present day
# Got stepped after, being genuine we're swept away
# Before the importance of diamonds, bells
# And a platinum place, fallen from grace
# Not my campus with another trace
# Of the same thing I came in, this thing is worth saving
# Standing in the pockets holding tongues of what I'm saying
# Blaming myself only for supporting what they're playing
# I may peek through the storm, but now it's raining
# Unchanging of late, it's hard to be creative
# Although creating is native to me, I tried to be
# Even patience couldn't save it, from the days of pages
# They couldn't believe I would say this
# No longer without wings, Kamau is what my name is
# Too many undermind, what I underline
# Placing my poetry underneath their making of rhymes
# It was a creation of frustration
# Brown bricks or blank slates
# Subway trains and cardboard bound with masking tape
# It was the sound of the evening, the way the day grew late
# Words tumble from lungs over my tongue
# And gave a new taste to my fate
# It doesn't even matter how the chatter would paint us
# With love on our side they could barely stand against us
# Um, what up? Uh Kheaven, what's goin' down?
# Um I got your message, and uh yeah, basically call me back
# Basically call me back and tell me
# Sorry about the length of the message, but you know
# You feelin' it? Aight man peace
# (End of message)
> K-Os
# (Intro)
# Swing high then swing low
# I know we all know
# Swing high then swing low
# I know we all know
# (K-Os)
# I was rushing to the end
# But you're everything I saw, again
# And hoping to pretend
# I was knocking on heavens door my friends
# But I was just a fool, caught up in the game
# Everything is cool, believing in my name instead of his
# And then the sun came out
# I couldn't find the shade, I'm not afraid
# Of the light anymore
# (Chorus)
# Patience
# Heavens on the side be patient
# The universe is mines
# Patience
# Everything is grand use patience
# And you can understand
# (K-Os)
# Now everyone knows
# We hold the key deep in our souls
# But we are living a life on the surface yo
# What's the purpose of living lies
# Somebody tell me
# Some hearts are made of stone (of stone)
# They'll find their way back home (home)
# I know I walk the path of life eternally
# To be free, its all time
# (Chorus)
# Patience
# Heavens on the side be patient (heavens on your side)
# The universe is mines (and you don't travel anywise)
# Patience
# Everything is grand use patience (use patience)
# And you can understand (you can understand)
# (Outro)
# Swing high then swing low
# I know we all know
# Swing high then swing low
# I know we all know

# [Verse 1]
# Ending is coming and fast is soon
# I don't need your pain and adversity
# Rising like the sun in the highest noon
# I don't want to lose the ability
# Look at how they coming and they hang me high (hang me high)
# Leave me out here, hang me out to dry (out to dry)
# Standing on the side like some parasites, waiting on their turn to eat
# And in this game of destiny, every man is asking 'why?'
# Or how they want to govern me
# I couldn't let them if they tried
# And in my deepest, darkest side
# He was there to ease the pain
# So i give up all my pie, just to glorify his name
# [Chorus: x2]
# Tell me 'how did you get so low?' (so low)
# When you know you're a superstar
# If there's pain, then just let it go (let it go)
# Don't forget that you know who you are...
# [Verse 2]
# And it doesn't last
# When you turn the sand, into glass
# They can steal the sun, out of the sky
# Reach for a star, never too high
# Don't shoot me down, not that you would
# Don't pass me by, i'm not your fool
# [Chorus: x3]
> K-Os
# She could turn the sand into glass
# She could steal a jewel from the past
# She could steal the sun out of the sky
# Reach for a star never to high
# Don't shoot me down
# Not that you would
# Don't pass me by...
# Baby she's a superstar who likes to dream
# Baby says to me her mind is never gonna change
# Baby she's a superstar who likes to dream
# Baby says to me her mind is never gonna change
# Never change (superstar, superstar)
# Never change (superstar, superstar)
# Never change (superstar, superstar)
# Never change...
# Intoxicate my every thought
# Try to forget things I forgot
# Don't shoot me down
# Not like you would
# Don't pass me by
# Baby she's a superstar who likes to dream
# Baby says to me her mind is never gonna change
# Baby she's a superstar who likes to dream (superstar)
# Baby says to me her mind is never gonna change
# Baby she's a superstar (superstar)
# Baby she's a superstar (superstar)
# Baby she's a superstar (superstar)
# Baby she's a superstar (superstar)
> K-Os
# Contrary to popular belief, know what yo
# This is not a lovesong
# It's a sonnett
# Damn if feels good to have people up on it but
# I'm just a fool playing with the masters tools
# Learning how to break the rules of this record company pool
# Hallucination - I see with my eyes
# But my heart's telling me lies
# Why do I fantisize?
# Why am I telling lies to the people from the stage
# Pretending it's all good when inside it's fire and rage
# Cuz I can't understand how a man lives off the life of another man
# Tryin to pimp the universe - that's a joke
# I stay rockin the boat down on my last note
# It's murder she wrote
# Assassination vocabulary
# I see your termination is heavily necessary
# I should have known - they do it for Forbes alone
# I do it to break the walls if I fell off then let me know people
# CHORUS
# It's funny how life can go
# First you ride high then you might lay low
# Don't get high off your own supply
# Someone said first before a four comes five
# This is my message to the world
# Just tryin to reach every boy and girl
# Not tryin to say if it's right or wrong
# This is not a love song
# Lyrical optometrists with 20/20 vision
# Are serving rounds like my granny used to serve provisions
# Chaotical amneotical fluid
# The rap druid is fluent in the art of onomatopoeia
# Metaphysical microscopic topic dropper
# When I was a kid I wanted rollerskates and a bike chopper
# But alas, pop, pop never thought to keep me in style
# Thats why I'm schizophrenic now
# So God bless the child that has his own
# The harvest we reap is what we sow
# Chrome microphone - shoot it
# Towards a dome of computer digital clones that could be mixed for lots of pistones
# Sayin a style's their own when they bite like Mike Furounsville
# The sounds ill
# Relationship is a mirror
# That you see yourself up in and the picture is clearer
# Thats why I'm on the scene with a mike like Ernesto Guevara
# Why I may exploit with lights like Geraldo Rivera, they just.
# CHORUS(again)
# It's easy not to care what people say
# It's harder to pretend and try
# Cuz they can only love you from yesterday
# I'm looking at them now they pose high
# I'm just a man who's walking
# They stand around and keep talking
# They tried to clip my wings
# But wisdom fills so many things
# Say it again
# I'm just a man who's walking
# They stand around and keep talking
# They tried to clip my wings
# But wisdom fills so many things
# It's funny how life can go
# Dont get high off your own supply
# This is my message to the world
> K-Rino
# Straight from god a gift to bring calm to the storm
# Soft and warm a heaven in human form
# Black queen her touch is like energy from the sun
# Can't imagine life without her cuz it wouldn't be none
# My respect for you seems to increase with time
# Blessed to find one who gives me constant piece of mind
# Stress free which lets me overcome struggle & grief
# A sacred specimen creation beyond belief
# Her beautiful conversations like songs from a bird
# Hidden power deep enough to move mountains with a word
# React as if I ain't seen black women in days
# I'm overpowered and phased by sweet feminine ways
# Darkness come I find you bring light to the mind
# Memories of you rewind time give sight to the blind
# Keeping learning about each other it remains new & fresh
# Let our souls merge together till we transcend flesh
# It's like heaven on earth when you're around
# After all the things we been thru we still down
# You show love for me (love for me) when I'm wrong
# You give me so much in my life you keep me strong
# The things you do for me to satisfy me baby baby
# Ready to face whatever god plans to stay together
# God leading the way so we ain't scared to pray together
# Whatever you're past holding baby never mind that
# Let's take the word relationship and redefine that
# Never ever disrespect ya that's the ultimate rule
# To curse a woman is to curse your own existence fool
# It don't matter if she yella caramel pitch black
# I be feeling what you say just thru eye contact
# Able to take a man civilize him when he was wild
# And reproduce a copy of him in the form of his child
# Your like the sun in the daytime and the moon at night
# Universal life I see you when my thoughts take flight
# & if it's real we gonna step it up when trouble appears
# And every second that we spend apart gonna seem like years
# My life is gonna be judged by the way that I treat you
# Lets start over boo my name is K-rino it's nice to meet ya
# It's like heaven on earth when you're around
# After all the things we been thru we still down
# You show love for me (love for me) when I'm wrong
# You give me so much in my life you keep me strong
# The things you do for me to satisfy me baby baby
# Your life story got to be one developed in stages
# y'all can't write the same book if you on 2 different pages
# Understand it ain't about material stuff
# If you don't stimulate her mind then the world ain't enough
# She down to earth but if im in the wrong quick to get brave
# Knowing how to be submissive without being a slave
# Consolation that I'm needing when she feeding my soul
# Cast my words into the universe and let them unfold
# Anything I'm tryna get done she ready to roll
# The most beautiful vision 2 eyes could ever behold
# Knowing she will be the one from the second we meet
# I strive to elevate and place the universe at her feet
# Everyday is mothers day so don't ever forget it
# Tryna keep it real and do better by staying committed
# From body, soul to mind she Devine by design
# Just to keep her safe I'm down to place my life on the line
# It's like heaven on earth when you're around
# After all the things we been thru we still down
# You show love for me (love for me) when I'm wrong
# You give me so much in my life you keep me strong
# The things you do for me to satisfy me baby baby

# Thinking about what a

# Well, I dreamed I saw the silver
# Space ships flying
# In the yellow haze of the sun,
# There were children crying
# And colors flying
# All around the chosen ones.
# All in a dream, all in a dream
# The loading had begun.
# They were flying Mother Nature's
# Silver seed to a new home in the sun.

# Like a bird on the wire,
# Like a drunk in a midnight choir
# I have tried in my way to be free.
# Like a worm on a hook,
# Like a knight from some old fashioned book
# I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
# If I, if I have been unkind,
# I hope that you can just let it go by.
# If I, if I have been untrue
# I hope you know it was never to you.
# Like a baby, stillborn,
# Like a beast with his horn
# I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
# But I swear by this song
# And by all that I have done wrong
# I will make it all up to thee.
# I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
# He said to me, 'You must not ask for so much.'
# And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
# She cried to me, 'Hey, why not ask for more?'
# Oh like a bird on the wire,
# Like a drunk in a midnight choir
# I have tried in my way to be free

# Now I've heard there was a secret chord
# That David played, and it pleased the Lord
# But you don't really care for music, do you?
# It goes like this
# The fourth, the fifth
# The minor fall, the major lift
# The baffled king composing Hallelujah
# Hallelujah
# Hallelujah
# Hallelujah
# Hallelujah
# Your faith was strong but you needed proof
# You saw her bathing on the roof
# Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
# She tied you
# To a kitchen chair
# She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
# And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# You say I took the name in vain
# I don't even know the name
# But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
# There's a blaze of light
# In every word
# It doesn't matter which you heard
# The holy or the broken Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# I did my best, it wasn't much
# I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
# I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
# And even though
# It all went wrong
# I'll stand before the Lord of Song
# With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah

# When you went up
# On so bright a burning trail, Tom
# I thought of it as my love
# Rocketing you along
# When you didn?t come back
# And didn?t come back, oh
# My nova heart collapsed
# To a black, black hole
# (chorus)
# From Ground Control
# To lost control
# From ballet to battle
# Halo to hole?
# (verse)
# You were so far gone
# Right was wrong, up was down.
# By going still further on,
# You?d hope?d  to come around
# It was light years long
# Dear husband Tom.
# At last back you?ve come
# ?and yet, still, you?re gone.
# (repeat chorus)
# I watched the sky, oh for all that time?
# And now your asteroid eyes
# say you were never mine.
# You didn?t burn up, my Major Tom.
# You just burnt out. You just burnt out.

# Tell me baby, where did we go wrong,
# How did we lose a love so strong,
# What can I say to make things right,
# Baby hold on, don't leave tonight,
# There's no reason why,
# A part of us should die,
# Don't say goodbye.
# Searching for answers.
# But they're all so hard to find.
# Cuz I'm still loving you baby,
# Are you still loving me?
# Baby, don't turn and close the door,
# Is it you don't love me anymore.
# Tell me baby, where did we go wrong,
# How did we lose a love so strong,

# Bluish gray,
# Suns don't rise,
# Bathing deep in stolen dreams from borrowed times,
# The morning breaks to vacant signs of you.
# The shallow pools,
# As if the tears were mine,
# Shade the waves' reflections left behind,
# I search my faith to never find a clue.
# And now you're gone,
# Somehow your're gone,
# You were my midnight, you were my dawn,
# You were my world, you were my song,
# You're everything i could depend on,
# But now all you are is gone...
# And I passed the blame, and it's passed the time,
# To cross my heart and walk across that line,
# Whose will is this, which poets lines pull at you?
# And now you're gone,
# Somehow your're gone,
# You were my midnight, you were my dawn,
# You were my world, you were my song,
# You're everything i could depend on,
# But now all you are is gone...

# I feel you fading away
# I feel you falling apart
# I see behind all the tears
# Don't let yourself cry... cry...
# I see goodbye, in your eyes
# After the roses, after the rain
# Baby, I'm holdin on
# And you feel a million miles away
# Leaving you in my heart
# I see the sweetness of what used to be
# Becoming apart of my memories

# Baby, don't let go
# Tell me I'm wrong

# The candles whisper,
# The shadows outline that you're right on time for the very first time...
# You can't conceal that look,
# The one I couldn't ignore,
# Your look this evening was meant to deny...
# The black and white's on the wall,
# Our future there in Doisneau,
# My pocket is heavy with diamonds tonight...
# But they won't shine on your hand,
# And what I thought were our plans flicker out with goodbye...
# Am I the last to know?
# Your eyes are cold but my tears are warm,
# Why do people like you hurt people like me?
# You blind your fear with your pride,
# Protect the woman inside,
# I know you know how true it can be...
# But you're afraid of the need,
# Can't risk the imminent bleed,
# What is love but the greatest of dangers...
# And now the songs are a lie,
# I never dreamed you would cry in a bed of a stranger...
# Am I the last to know?
# And in the shuddered rush, I will fall...
# And in the tumbling I see it all...
# A hushed release of you, and I'm free, and alive, and my heart, is the
# last...
# Am I the Last to know?

# (Verse 1)
# I use to think that love was just a fairy tale
# Until that first hello
# Until that first smile
# But if I had to do it all again
# I wouldn't change a thing
# Cuz this love is everlasting
# (Chorus)
# Suddenly (Suddenly, suddenly)
# Life has new meaning to me
# There's beauty up above and things we never take notice of
# You wake up and suddenly you're in love (oooh)
# (Verse 2)
# Girl you're everything a man could want and more
# A thousand words are not enough to say what I feel inside
# Holding hands as we walk along the shore
# Never felt like this before (Never felt like this before)
# Now you're all I'm living for
# (Chorus)
# Suddenly
# Life has new meaning to me
# There's beauty up above and things we never take notice of
# You wake up and suddenly you're in love
# (Verse 3)
# Each day (Each day baby)
# I pray
# This of love we feel will last forever
# (Chorus)
# Suddenly
# Life has new meaning to me
# There's beauty up above and things we never take notice of
# You wake up and suddenly you're in love (ooohhhh)
# You're in love (ooohh)
# There's beauty up above and things we never take notice of

# Občutek me ne vara in slutim tudi to,
# poglej me drugič dvakrat v oči,
# mogoče tudi v tebi čustvo se zbudi
# in skupaj bova odšla. --- Vem zakaj...
# Tri dni ne bi odklenil, odprl okna, ti nežno šepetal,
# pozabil bi kaj je naokrog, pokril bi ti telo s poljubi.
# In večno rad poslušal bi le
# tvoje dihanje kot glasbo.
# Na koncu razočaran bom in žalosten
# odšel domov.
# Rad bi ti zapel pesmi o ljubezni,
# ki rada jih poslušaš vsak dan.
# Le znaj, da te besede, mogoče brez pomena,
# povedati želijo ti le:
# Le kaj naj naredim, da te dobim
# in da ti ukradem noč.

# Slabo počutim se,

# Po robu hodim zdaj,
# po robu hodim zdaj, slišiš.
# Strupeni jezik otresaj drugje,
# odprte misli pusti za me.
# Naj te ne slišim, čakajo me.
# Samo še jaz ustavljam jih še, oh, vse.
# Ne bom se jokal za,
# ne bom se jokal za denarjem,

# smisel na svetu ni živeti sto let v prazno,
# Smrtni greh --
# v svoji sluzbi vsak dan zapet.
# Sto let v prazno. Smrtni greh --
# V svoji druzbi vedno odpet.
# Vedno odpet, vedno odpet.
# V svoji družbi sem,

# Debate od miz do miz,

# Prišla si z jutrom, obdana z lepoto.
# Nemir je v meni,
# zastal mi je dih,
# nič več obljub, le žarek pronica,
# vedno dlje je ozorje,
# obris tvojih let.
# Gladina dneva z jutrom v roki,
# negotovi koraki,
# dan prelil se je v noč.
# In ta je vtkana v reliefe obraza,
# spojena s pogledi zamujenih let.
# Minevajo ure in ure,
# dnevi in leta,
# v dlaneh življenje je zastalo,
# žarek skozi meglo mojega sveta.
# če iščem v vsakem pogledu,
# kaj je v njem, kaj se skriva.
# Spomnim se:
# debele solze zalila tvoj otroški je obraz.

# Zvečer odprem tvoje dolgo pismo.
# Saj že vem: stavki kratki,

# Oči zaprem,
# misli ustavijo se mi za hip.
# Zgodba znana znova se ponavlja:
# Ljubezen je kot roža,
# hitro oveni,
# čas, ki ima v sebi, hrepeni.
# Ljubezen je sreča in raj.
# Glej, to je krog lepote,
# minljiv, kakor raj.
# Ta hip je sreča, ljubezen in raj.
# Zato prižgem stari dober radio,
# saj že vem: pesmi stare,
# polne znanih mi vsebin.
# In spet ta glas,
# čas ustavil se je za hip.
# In zgodba znana znova se ponavlja.

# have I been just and righteous
# what is glory
# I know I've torn and taken life
# and here I stand
# a small and simple man
# who will trade his karma for my kingdom
# a sacrificial rite to render truth
# the fire in my soul rejects my wisdom
# cause all you do in life comes back to you
# I am a king in crisis
# counting minutes
# there is an ending to my reign
# my sins have come to face me
# I can feel it
# that I have lived my life in vain
# and now I know I'll reap
# the seeds I've sown
# who will trade his karma for my kingdom
# a sacrificial rite to render truth
# the fire in my soul rejects my wisdom
# cause all you do in life comes back to you
# am I mad
# I feel so void and cold
# who can tell
# who holds the stories untold
# tired and trembling
# I am descending
# will I have to stay here

# A funny thing happened to me just the other day
# A girl came my way
# She called your name, she said some things
# I thought it was just some hear-say
# But then she showed me a picture or two
# Of her with some dude
# In positions that weren't cool
# And then I looked again
# And I saw that this dude was you
# My first reaction was to snap on her
# But what good would that do?
# You know that I had better things
# Than fightin' over you
# So many times, it seems that I refuse to see the truth
# But this time, you know that I am through
# So just walk right out the door
# Cuz you can't come back here no more
# You know we've been through this before
# So you can't come back, you can't come back
# You're in and out of my life
# This time was your last try
# You made your bed, so there you lie
# So you can't come back
# The last time you deceived me
# You said give you one more chance
# You blamed it on your weaknesses
# Of just being a man
# I was a fool to believe in you
# Put my heart in your hands
# I shoulda known when you did me wrong
# You'd just do it again
# Please just leave, no convincing me
# You will ever be the man for me
# I'm so sick and tired
# Of hearing lies from you
# Just pack your bags
# Cuz I am through
# So just walk right out the door
# Cuz you can't come back here no more
# You know we've been through this before
# So you can't come back, you can't come back
# Did everything to please you
# But still, there wasn't enough
# Gave you my heart and soul, total control
# All I wanted was your love
# And see, now time after time
# I kept takin' you back
# Endless tears I spent on you
# And I'm tired of forgiving
# So goodbye, good riddence
# It's time for me to start living
# So just walk right out the door
# Cuz you can't come back here no more
# You know we've been through this before
# So you can't come back, you can't come back
# Can't come back no more
# (You can't hurt me, no)
# No, you can't come back no more

# To see the way that everything should be
# To feel the joy that we were meant to know
# We should have realized it so long ago
# We're all together
# Harmony will abound
# Look at each other
# All that was lost is found
# New situation
# If our direction's true
# We're all together
# Everyone is me and you
> Kansas
# Virgin land of forest green
# Dark and stormy plain
# Here all life abounds
# Sunlit valley, mountain fields
# Unseen in the rain
# Here all life abounds
# No man rules this land
# No human hand has soiled this paradise
# Waiting patiently
# So much to see
# So rich in Earth's delights
# Painted desert, sequined sky
# Stars that fill the night
# Here all life abounds
# Rivers flowing to the sea
# Sunshine pure and bright
# Here all life abounds
# No man rules this land
# No human hand has soiled this paradise
# Waiting patiently
# So much to see
# So rich in Earth's delights
# So the maiden lies in waiting
# Pull the sailor into shore
# Land of beauty and abundance
# Innocent, you opened wide your door
# Wanderers found the waiting treasure
# Full of gifts beyond their measure
# Milk and Honey for our pleasure
# Across the sea there came a multitude
# Sailing ships upon the wave
# Filled with visions of Utopia
# And the freedom that they crave
# Ravage, plunder, see no wonder
# Rape and kill and tear asunder
# Chop the forest, plow it under
# Highways scar the mountainside
# Buildings to the sky
# People all around
# Unsustaining in these roads
# See an eternity
# People all around
# So we rule this land
# And here we stand
# Upon our paradise
# Dreaming of a place
# Our weary race
# Is ready to arise
> Kansas
# I'm woven in a fantasy
# I can't believe the things I see
# The path that I have chosen
# Has led me to a wall
# And with each passing day
# I feel a little more
# Like something dear was lost
# It rises now before me
# A dark and silent barrier between
# All I am
# And all that I would ever want to be
# It's just a travesty
# Towering
# Marking off the boundaries my spirit
# Would erase
# To pass beyond is what I seek
# I feel that I may be too weak
# And those are few
# Who've seen it through
# To glimpse the other side
# The promised land is waiting
# Like a maiden
# That is soon to be a bride
# The moment is a masterpiece
# The weight of indecision's in the air
# It's standing there
# The symbol and the sum of all that's me
# It's just a travesty
# Towering
# Blocking all the light and blinding me
# I want to see
# Gold and diamonds cast a spell
# It's not for me, I know it well
# The treasures that I seek
# Are waiting on the other side
# There's more that I can measure
# In the treasure of the love that I can find
# And though it's always been with me
# I must tear down the wall and let it be
# All I am
# And all that I was ever meant to be
# In harmony
# Shining true and smiling back
# At all who wait to cross
# There is no more

# [Verse 1]
# Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
# Vegas on acid, seen through East St. Laurent glasses
# And I realise that I've arrived
# 'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my vibe, does
# He write his own rhymes, sort of, I think 'em
# That mean I forgat better shit than you ever thought of
# Damn, is he really that caught up
# I ask, if you talk about clasics do my name get brought up?
# I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
# Or even a four-track recorder
# So its only right that I let the top drop on a drop top Porche
# It's spoilin' yourself thats important
# If you striper name Porcha and you get tips from many men
# Then your fat friend, her nickname is mini-van
# Excuse me, that's just the Henni, man
# I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because
# [Verse 2]
# I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
# Only player that got robbed and kept all his jewlery
# Alicia Keys tried talk some sense in him
# Thrity minutes later saw his note convincin' him
# What mo' could you ask fo'
# The international asshole
# Who complained about what he is owed
# And throw a tantrem like he is three years old
# You gotta love it though
# Somebody still speak from his soul
# And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
# When he came in the game he made his own lane
# Now all I need is ya'll to pronounce my name
# Is Kanye but some of my plaques still say Kayne
# Got family in the ?D-King?, folks from Mo Town
# Back in Chi, them folks ain't from ?Mo Town?
# Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
# Girl ain't give me no ass, she need to go down
# My father Ben said I need Jesus, so he took me to church
# And let the water let the water run over my ?sleezer?
# The preacher said we need leaders
# Right then my body got steel, like a paraplegic
# You know who you call, you got a message to leave it
# The Roc stand tall, and you would never believe it
# Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
# Ya, the beat cold but the flow is anemic
# After debris settles and the dust gets swept off
# Big K kick it where young Hov left off
# Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
# I drop my new shit, it sound like the best of
# A&Rs lookin like phhttt we messed up
# Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
# Bottle after bottle 'till we got messed up
# In the studio, we really though, ya he next up
# People askin' me is I gon'give my chain back
# That'll be the same day I give the game back
# You know the next question all yo, where Dame at?
# He's tracked the Indian dance to bring our rain back
# What's up with you and Jay, man? Are ya'll okay, man?
# They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
# R-r-r-r-right here stand a man
# With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
# "Diamonds are forever, forever, forever"
# "Diamonds are forever, forever, forever"

# Diamonds are forever
# They're all I need to please me

# Good Morning, this ain't Vietnam still
# People lose hands, legs, arms for real
# Little was known of Sierra Leone
# And how it connect to the diamonds we own
# When I speak of Diamonds in this song
# I ain't talkin bout the ones that be glown
# I'm talkin bout Rocafella, my home, my chain
# These ain't conflict diamonds,is they Jacob? don't lie to me mayne
# See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin',
# How? when I know of the blood diamonds
# Though it's thousands of miles away
# Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
# Over here, its a drug trade, we die from drugs
# Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs
# The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
# I thought my Jesus Piece was so harmless
# 'til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
# And here's the conflict
# It's in a black person's soul to rock that gold
# Spend ya whole life tryna get that ice
# On a polar rugby it look so nice
# How could somethin' so wrong make me feel so right, right?
# 'fore I beat myself up like Ike
# You could still throw ya Rocafella diamond tonight, 'cause

# I got it from her 'ye damn!
# The chain remians, the gang is in tact
# The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
# The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack? (laughs)
# Part of me I had to laugh at that
# How could you falter when you're the rock of gibralter
# I had to get of the boat so I could walk on water
# This ain't no tour order, this is nothin to me
# Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
# I do this in my sleep,
# I sell Kilos of coke, (so?) I'm guessin' I can sell CD's
# I'm not a buisness man I'm a buisness, man
# Let me handle my buisness, damn!
# Kanyeez you got me, Freeway and Foxy
# YG', Teairra Mari, Petey watch me
# Bleek could be one hit away his whole career

# So he can just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah
# He don't even have to write rhymes
# The Dynasty like my money last three lifetimes

# And last time I tried to poke her she just told me goodnight
# See her clothing be tight
# She was pervert approved
# So she gave up on life, now she don't wanna move
# Hypnotized by the tube
# So she stay with the clicker
# In a cup full of liquor
# Thinkin its makin her thicker
# But its makin her slimmer
# So our future is dimmer
# I cant remember last time I took my baby to dinner
# See I'm sayin' a sister who was freaky and ruthless
# In a yorkshire terrier in the pocket with pooches
# In a pocket with Gucc's
# Was taking my lunch money

# People even think theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got big--
# But if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re scared of being mentally unwell,
# just you relax, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no need for a padded cell
# To be loopy, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to break your brain
# The trick is to remain inane while seeming so insane
# Everybody loves a loony
# Everybody loves a loony.
# Everybody loves a loony...
# Are you smug that you are plain
# but dropped the tedium and gained
# what you believe to be a charm
# and others saw a (hectic?) phony
# irritating wacky smarm
# from this hearing wise advice that:
# Everybody loathes a loony.
# Everyone knows that!
# Everybody loathes a loony.
# Loonies are such pratts.
# Looneys have so much attention,
# they irritate, canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be ignored.
# Loonies leave you--

# So many people
# People settle down
# I want to be part of a small suburban town
# I want net curtains to catch the pink of dawn
# I want some corduroys with which to mow the lawn
# So let's not lie
# We're quite plain
# And find this life
# Of filthy strain
# Rather tiresome
# And I do dream of
# Tranquility
# As semi-detachedly
# As fate meant me to be
# I don't really want a Ford Orion.
# So many people
# People settle down
# Have dinner parties to invite the boss around
# I want stone cladding
# On my pebbledash
# Electric clippers for my middle-class mustache.
# So let's not lie
# I cannot live within this vile alternative
# Squalid style
# And I do dream of
# Tranquility
# As semi-detachedly
# As fate meant me to be
# I don't really want a Ford Sierra.
# So many people
# Are pension plan secure
# Take yearly holidays
# Through 10-day package tours
# I want two bathrooms in which to lay my stool
# I want some offspring to send to private schools
# So let's go straight
# I am a snob
# and I do hate life with little job in office
# And I do dream of
# Tranquility
# As semi-detachedly
# As fate meant me to be
# And I don't really want a Ford Grenada.
# So many people
# People settle down
# Why don't we share part of a small suburban town?
# Try not to sneer
# Please suffocate your scorn
# I love suburban heaven for in heaven I was born.

# (Speaking): I like old fashioned music

# LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s redefine the past
# Oh, nostalgia
# LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s redefine the past
# LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s redefine the past now
# Crackle up your gramophone
# Reel around romantic tones
# Sit back in your rocking chair
# Warm beneath your gloving(?) pair

# And when I lose my way I close my eyes and he has found me.
# In the rain the pavement shines like silver,
# All the lights are misty in the river.
# In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight....
# And all I see is him and me forever and forever.
# And I know its not only in my mind,
# That I'm talking to myself and not to him.
# And although I know that he is blind,
# Still I say, there's a way for us.
# I love him!
# But when the night is over,
# He is gone, the river's just a river.
# Without him the world around me changes,
# The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full
# of strangers.

# All my life I've only been pretending.
# Without me his world would go on turning,

# Her Mama cussed
# She was out of film
# As her baby came down those stairs
# Looking right at her boyfriend
# His hands, they shook
# As he pinned on her corsage
# And she almost cried
# Cause she'd liked this guy
# From the very start.
# Shoulda been just another first
# And not the last
# Beautiful moment in two lives
# When they looked back
# But now they're
# (chorus)
# Flowers by the side of the road
# Yeah, that's all that's left
# Of the hopes and dreams
# Of two seventeen year-olds
# Some dreams live on
# And some, they don't
# All that's left to know
# All that's left to show
# Are flowers by the side of the road
# Could've been me
# Could've been you
# How many times have I said
# I've just had one or two
# It's a sobering thought
# It's a sobering sight
# How like a bad, bad dream
# You can lose everything
# On a careless night
# Be the one who lives
# Be the one who's gone
# Be the mother whose heart
# Has to somehow go on
# But she'll leave
# (Repeat chorus)
> Katrina Elam
# Everybody told me he was a dream
# Picture perfect like he stepped right off the silver screen
# Said that he would sweep me off my feet
# But I'm still standing – No he didn't do it for me
# 'Cause I don't go for all that wine and dine
# with the Ray Ban / Fake tan / Never mind
# Chorus:
# I want a down home / Up-with-the-sun-rise man
# A pick-up truck driving / Bull riding / Strong steady hand
# I want the Wranglers / Stetson / and all that stuff
# I want the real McCoy
# I want a Cowboy
# I'm tired of talking 'bout it / Wasting my time
# On all the cheap talkers – needing me / feeding me lines
# Give me somebody who's tender but tough
# Simple and honest / Knows a thing or two about love
# I've seen enough to know I know what I like
# It's the hard working / head turning / rugged type
# Repeat Chorus:
# Bridge:
# I've seen enough to know – ya know what I mean
# Ride me off into the sunset
# That's my thing
# Repeat Chorus:
# Give me the Wranglers / Stetson / All that stuff
# I want the real McCoy
# I want a cowboy
# I want a cowboy
> Katrina Elam
# I won't write a note
# That's a coward's way out
# I won't bring it up
# There's nothing left to talk about
# He'll just tell me that love is never perfect
# He's so convincing but I've already heard it
# Chorus
# I won't draw it out
# I won't stop to cry
# He may be caught off guard
# But he won't be surprised
# This is where I usually let him
# Change my mind
# This time I'm gonna leave
# But I won't say goodbye
# He knows where I'm weak
# And what I can't resist
# And how to make me second guess
# Conviction like this
# So I'll just go on and
# Skip to the healing
# He won't hear me say it
# But he'll know what I was feeling
# Chorus
# He'd ask me where I'm headed
# But I don't know where I'm going
# He'd ask if I still love him
# But that's not the point
# Chorus
> Katrina Elam
# Everybody does it, that's what everybody says
# As they smoke their cigarettes on Friday night
# And if you're still a virgin by the time that you're a junior
# Then the rumor going 'round is you ain't right
# Maybe I'm hard headed or a little bit old fashioned
# But I always had a hard time fitting in
# So when they rolled their eyes at me and told me I ain't normal
# I always took it as a compliment
# Chorus:
# Where I'm from normal is high school girls having kids
# Marrying the boys that you grew up with
# They say girl get your head on straight
# You sit around and dream all day
# That far away look in your eye ain't normal
# Somebody's got to wear the roller skates down at the Sonic
# But it never really fit into my plans
# So when I up and moved 1000 miles from Oklahoma
# Nobody in that town could understand
# Chorus:
# Where I'm from normal is doing what your mama did
# Marrying the boys that you grew up with
# They say girl get your head on straight
# You sit around and dream all day
# That far away look in your eye ain't normal
# (But) I say yeah, what's so great about normal
# Bridge:
# I don't know what happens but that's okay
# 'Cause I know what wouldn't happened if I stayed
# Repeat 2nd Chorus
> Katrina Elam
# Oh, I love the rain when it's really coming down
# When it howls, when it moans, when it sings
# I'll probably catch my death, but I'll die happy and wet
# 'Cause I love strong anything
# Oh, I like my coffee black, my whiskey straight up
# I don't need no silver cup to drink
# I wanna taste life now, so don't water it down
# I love strong anything
# Chorus
# 'Cause I won't settle for anything less
# And I cry out with my every breath
# For joy, for pain, whatever life will bring
# Give me strong anything
# I wanna lover who is tough
# Tough enough to stand up to me
# And let truth like freedom ring
# 'Cause riding down the road, I wanna know that my soulmate
# Love' strong anything
# No you don't need to part the sea, burn a bush for me
# My faith has found its wings
# It's a god given desire to reach higher and higher
# For strong anything
# Repeat chorus
# ..Give it to me strong…come on…
# Oh, I love the rain when it's really coming down
# When it howls, when it moans, when it sings

> Katrina Elam
# I remember the day you left me crying
# You just drove away
# I felt something break down deep inside
# I was lost and afraid
# Then I realized that love and life are
# Like a roller-coaster ride
# You've gotta laugh at the hurt
# 'Cause you get stronger when you crash and you burn
# And you live and you learn
# Chorus:
# I'm unbreakable
# I'm unshakable
# I've got a shatterproof heart
# I've lived through the leavin'
# Put back the pieces
# Learned from every scar
# Can't be torn apart
# 'Cause I'm unbreakable
# I'm seeing my life in full color
# For the very first time
# Looking at a brand new day
# I'll take whatever, give me sun give me rain
# Give me joy give me pain 'cause
# Repeat Chorus

# I know I'm gonna fall bound to hit a wall
# It might hurt me (but I'm unbreakable)
# Sometimes I'm gonna win lose it all again

# I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
# Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
# So I sat quietly, agreed politely
# I guess that I forgot I had a choice

# I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
# You held me down, but I got up
# Already brushing off the dust
# You hear my voice, your hear that sound
# Like thunder, gonna shake your ground
# You held me down, but I got up
# Get ready cause I’ve had enough
# I see it all, I see it now
# I got the eye of the tiger, the fighter, dancing through the fire
# Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR
# Louder, louder than a lion
# Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR
# Oh oh oh oh oh oh
# You’re gonna hear me roar
# Now I’m floating like a butterfly
# Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes

# Already brushing off the dust
# You hear my voice, your hear that sound
# Like thunder, gonna shake your ground

# When you say you'l always be there
# It paints such a lovely picture
# But no matter how you frame it
# It's still pornography
# Nobody seems to hear
# Till I scream and shout
# Evan if you tie me down
# And you blow my candle out
# I'll still glow
# I'll still glow
# I'll be the perfict someone that you'll never know
# I'll still glow
# I see this girl with so much anger
# Pacified by holding starngers
# Making peace with all her danger
# By looking in the mirror
# The pureness in my name is gone now
# You've taken it too far but somehow
# I'll lick my wounds and take the last bow
# And hold my cold left hand
# There's so many things
# That you rant about
# The only thing I know for sure
# If you blow my candle out
# I'll still glow
# I'll still glow
# I'll be the perfict someone
# That you'll never know
# I'll still glow
# [guitar solo]
# I'll still glow
# I'll still glow
# I'll be the pertfict someone
# That you'll- that you'll never know
# I'll still glow
# I'll still glow
# I'll be the perfict someone that you'll never know
# I'll still glow

# I wanna live before I die
# So don't say I have to cry on
# One more freezing floor
# I ask you to open the door
# And see how things could have gone
# The reason that it took so long
# Before you could figure out
# That for so long I was about to break
# And there were no arms to keep me
# From harming me and now I'm searchin back to see
# How I never tried to ask for some sympathy
# 'cause no- nobody wants to ride with me too far
# 'cause I might trip away
# But in your arms I'd rather stay
# You might just turn into something I like
# You might just turn into something I like
# You might just turn into something I li-li-li-li-li-li-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
# You might just turn into something I
# Want to dream about
# Something I can't live withouit
# My foot is in your hand
# I want you to understand
# How I could be confused
# Right after being used
# But still your here in spite
# When I close my eyes to dream at night
# I've gotta keep my pants on
# I gotta check my pulse before I've gone too far away
# To hurt so i think I'll stay around to hear ya breath
# Saying all those words to me
# Unraveling my fantasy while I drink
# My oleander tea
# You might just turn into something I like
# You might just turn into something I like
# You might just turn into something I li-li-li-li-li-li-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
# You might just turn into something I liii.... Yea-yea-ea-ea-ea-aa
# You might just tur into something I like
# You might just turn into something I like
# You might just turn into something I

# They've clipped my wings again
# Tore them apart and then
# Left me
# No use to fly away to
# My yesterday
# Of freedom
# My eyes died back that day
# Seeing the hurt I may have done
# Beat my instead of them
# Pain is my only zen
# Of fun
# I'll go where secrets are sold
# Where roses unfold
# I'll sleep as time goes by
# So hurting here is where I belong singing a sond
# Blood on my hands to stay strong
# The flowers in the graveyard are all gone I don't belong
# There is no right to heal the wronge
# Soup's on hot feelin' like a do or die
# I can't throw up don't think i evan want to try
# You still can't make me cry
# You've pinned this butterfly
# Down
# My fire's burning out
# Kill my flame without
# A frown
# And starving hurts the soul
# When you're hungry for
# Some love
# So if I close my eyes
# I can really fly
# Above
# I'll go where secrets are sold
# Where roses unfold
# I'll sleep as time goes by
# So hurting here is where I belong dreaming a song
# Blood on my hands to stay strong
# The flowers in the graveyard are all gone I don't belong
# There is no right to heal the wronge
# Soup's on hot feelin' like a do or die
# I can't throw up don't think I evan want to
# Tryyy- tryyyy- tryyyyyy
# [chorus again]
> Katy Rose
# You hold me like a puppet in your clammy hands
# Breathing your soft inuendoes
# I can feel the music through your eyes
# So much pain it hurts my soul
# Take me where oleander grow
# Show me all the things that I don't know
# I'm outside
# Let me in
# I'm still shedding my original skin
# Show me where I've never been
# I'm still shedding my original skin
# I am not afraid all I have to fear is myself
# Me or I
# My curls have twisted themselves into knots
# Twist and turn me inside out
# Show me what bliss is about
# I'm outside
# Let me in
# I'm still shedding my original skin
# Show me where I've never been
# I'm still shedding my original skin
# If I wait to run away
# I'll be trapped another day
# I'm still shedding my original skin
# Show me where I've never been
# I'm still shedding my original skin
# Lalalalalala...

# I only wish for snow to fall
# On the palm trees in the dirt
# But here the sun will always shine (It'll always shine)
# Even if with the clouds it flirts
# For Shngri-LA is always dry
# It doesn't cry like me
# In Hell-LA the sun is always there ( it's always there)
# Scalding the deep green sea
# I'll never be a snowflake
# And waltz to earth so gently
# To form a perfect blanket
# For someone else to walk on
# I've lost my mind in wanderlust
# My heart cannot be found
# My body yearns for the warmth of snow
# But the sun keep pouring down
# These streets have signs that point somewhere
# But there I don't belong
# And there's no more use
# To curl your hair
# When your innocence is gone
# I only wish for snow to fall
# On the palm trees in the dirt
# But here the sun will always shine (always shine)
# Even if with clouds it flirts
# [Chorus x2]

# I throw myself into the rain
# As we run down these old train
# Tracks again
# The moon is naked in the sky
# So maybe you and I could fly
# Or pretend
# As the stars fall from grace
# And light your glowing face
# I'm teachin' myself to dream
# I'm holding' my breath to scream
# I;m teachin' myself to belive in the world
# And it goes around in the sky so blue
# That's what dreamers do
# Can't say what day it is or year
# But thou shalt have no fear
# For I know your name
# You can't believe what I did
# And maybe I'm just a kid
# But the we're both the same
# I watch the hours through the glass
# And now the time will finally pass
# I'm teachin' myself to dream
# I'm learnin' what love can be
# I'm teachin' myself to
# Belive in the things I don't understand
# I don't even know if they're true
# That's what dreamers do
# Stapled eyes can't open until waking
# And all your lies will be your undertaking
# I let my mind dance and flow
# We'll magic and I'll know
# As the lilacs slowly grow
# All my dreams are true
# [repeat chorus]

# Oh I don't need an education
# Just a microphone's intoxication
# And I can't deal with concentration
# Give me tongues and stimulation
# Who are you to know my story
# Who are you to read my book
# I don't think you know how crazy,
# People say I am
# 'You're running in the deep end, Katy. Why don't you give a damn?'
# I've lost all sense of navigation,
# But got my Cali-fornication
# Don't give me words of hard degration,
# I only accept infatuation
# I'm a fragile kind of glass
# I won't wear your stupid mask
# I still hold hands with my creation
# But cross my eyes at it's elation
# And if I miss my graduation
# I'll have one f***ing long vacation

# I wish there was a photograph that showed me here with you
# And I could kiss the photograph and make my wish come true
# I wish I was a humming dove so I could sing so sweet
# I wish that I could steal the moon and kiss it with my feet
# I wish I was a remedy that you wanted to take
# A product of a recipe that no one had to bake
# I wish I could forget the day the hurting in my heart
# And wash our mouths with listerine to make a brand new start
# Watching the rain fall down
# Watching the rain
# Watching the rain
# Watching the rain fall down
# Watching the rain
# Watching the rain fall down
# I wish there was a fairytale that turned into my life
# So I could kiss Prince Charming man and be his princess wife
# I wish the voices in my head would leave my ears alone
# So my eyes could stop their water bleeding and I could find a home
# I wish there was a ruby rose where I spread my wings and flew
# So I could inhale the perfume and be the morning dew
# I wish the raindrops on the glass would let me join their dance
# I'd spin and twirl and laugh with them and drown my thoughts per-chance
# Woa woa I kinda like it
# Woa woa
# Woa woa I kinda like it this way
# Watchin the rain
# Watchin the rain
# Watchin the rain, watchin the rain

# I got something to tell y'all today
# Some of y'all might not like it
# But then again somebody out there might just well
# So let me take my time to tell you
# I feel good about telling you all of this
# Can I get a witness yeah, yeah
# Ever since I was a baby boy
# I played with ladies like my toys
# Always said I would never fall in love
# Don't want to care about a woman that much
# Never thought I would meet a girl
# Who would change my attitude now my heart doesn't care
# What I had on my mind is how fast I want to come to you
# Baby you're the reason why
# 1 - I won't never say never again
# I won't never say never again
# I won't never say never
# Cause lovin' you baby has taught me a lesson
# No, I won't never say never again
# JoJo sing it
# Ooh you got me going deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
# I just want to get a little deeper with you baby, ooh
# Don't stop let's go all the way, let's go all the way
# I wanna get a little deeper inside of you
# Baby I feel I can't get you out of my mind
# Repeat 1
# Never, never, never
# Never say never again
# Never, never, can I get a witness
# I am so hooked on you
# And I don't know what I'm gonna do
# If I don't have you in my life
# Repeat 1
# My mama told me
# She said K-Ci a lady should always be your precious gift
# But I didn't listen to mama, I didn't listen to mama
# Mama I'm sorry...
# Repeat 1
# Ooh baby, ooh baby
# Out of all things that I've done to you
# I feel sorry baby, oh yeah
# JoJo help me sing it
# Never, never, never, never, never, never, never
# Never, never, will I say never again, oh baby

# I must have rehearsed my lines a thousand times,

# do love you, oh.
# If only you knew,
# how much I do, do need you.
# I dream of moments we share, but your not there,
# I'm living in a fantasy.
# but you don't even suspect,
# could probably care less,

# 'Cause you'd headed out west to find yourself,
# An' you found yourself some guy.
# Now you'd always said that we'd be wed by the time you were twenty-three.
# Now for me, it looks like Plan B.
# Well, I gotta be strong, I gotta be tough,
# Gotta believe that I'm man enough,
# To chalk it all up to "it never was meant to be".
# Yeah, it's gonna be hard but I've gotta begin,
# To dust off my dreams an' dream 'em again,
# 'Cause I've gotta crazy to think you still love me...
# (Ahhh.)
# So that means just me and old Plan B.
# Well, at first I thought: "Hell, it doesn't matter.
# "I'd give it a year at best."
# But then somebody told me you were startin' to show,
# An' they had to let out your weddin' dress.
# Hell, man I can hear that door slam from LA all the way to Big D,
# Leavin' me with ol' Plan B, yeah.
# Well, I gotta be strong, I gotta be tough,
# Gotta believe that I'm man enough,
# To chalk it all up to "it never was meant to be".
# Yeah, it's gonna be hard but I've gotta begin,
# To dust off my dreams an' dream 'em again,

# Same Saturday night, same ol' crowd
# Draggin' Main to the Safeway then turn back around
# 'Til curfew and then head down to the river's edge and get drunk
# Ain't nothing new what else you gonna do out in Podunk
# Well I knew this six-string was my ticket out
# No flashin' red light was gonna slow me down
# 18 years old everything that I owned in the back of that truck
# I put a dip in my mouth and I headed straight out outta Podunk
# [1st Chorus:]
# Goodgye, daddy looked me in the eye said go where you gotta go
# But don't forget to call home
# And momma cried keep Jesus in your life and I hugged her one last time
# And then I headed down the roadin a dusty cloud of smoke
# Out of Podunk
# [Bridge:]
# A lot of years gone by showin' on my face
# Nothing in this life that time hasn't changed
# I chased a lot of dreams and some of them came true
# Ain't it funny how the very place I ran from is the place I'm runnin' to
# Another Saturday night singin' to the same ol' crowd
# Still playin this six-string but things are different nowI met one
# of those girls turn your whole world around girls
# And wouldn't you know it
# We got our eyes on a house 'bout a hundred miles south
# Out in Podunk
# [2nd Chorus:]
# Goodbye, her daddy looked me in the eye
# And said go where you gotta go son but don't forget to call home
# And her momma cried sadi keep Jesus in your life and we hugged her one last time
# Then we headed down the road to start a family of our own

# Keith Sweat, Da Brat
# I like that
# Who the one who put you on girl?
# I'm the one that put you on
# Who the one who put you on girl?
# I'm the one that put you on, come on
# It's funny how you do forget
# Where you were before we met
# I gave you things you could not dream
# Like a (?) car sittin' (?) with a green wood range, yeah
# Now girl I'd showed you
# Life without jewelry
# While I loved you
# Gave you all of me
# Now you act like
# Act like you don't know babe
# I'm trying to show you
# You were the only one
# 1 -
# How can you keep buggin'?
# When you were poor and struggling
# Girl I'm the one that put you on
# Girl I took you shopping
# When you didn't have nothing
# Girl I'm the one that put you on
# (Rodney)
# (Second verse)
# Upgraded you to first class flights
# And hit you off with so much ice
# I had you wearing the finest clothes
# Not every guy wants to creep on the low, oh
# I though I told you
# You could never find
# A love that's better
# Better girl then mine
# But now you're forcing
# It is all because of me
# Act like you know
# Cause girl I put you on
# Repeat 1
# [Da Brat]
# I tried to tell my nigga not to put you on
# Cause I seen your stanky ass around here before
# He said that you adored him
# But I knew it was fake
# You wasn't in love with him
# You wanted the money and fame
# So he gave you a slash of the good life
# Most hood rats wanna do more than see what it looks like
# I shook dice, bet ten g's that you were just for one night
# And not for keeps, then I saw you in the car with Keith
# At the mall, in the club at the bar with Keith
# And didn't nobody know you was a homie but me
# My homie put you in the dopest clothes and fresh sneakers
# And now you wanna play showboat and ask if did he
# You ain't pretty
# You just popular cause they know you done hit it
# If it wasn't for him icing you down from ear to ankles
# Wouldn't nobody check for you?
# So you should thank him
# Repeat 1
# (Da Brat)
# Let me tell you girl, oh
# You rocking ice because of me
# You got a jeep because of me
# You're looking fly because of me
# You got a Benz because of me
# You got a house because of me
# You got it all because of me
# You got minks because of me
# I put you on (yeah, yeah)
# I put you on (who is put this on? Darkchild)
# I put you on (who is on this? Da Brat)
# I put you on (Keith Sweat, it's like that)
# I put you on (You know Rodney Jerkins is dopest)
# I put you on (1999)
# I put you on (You know how we do)
# I put you on (To the two to the two)
# I put you on (Like that from all of my crew)

# Well I can't believe I'm sittin' here today
# Picking on my banjo with a big smile on my face
# Writin' new words to an old school melody
# Hey there ain't no doubt that God's been good to me
# Oh the sun is shinin' on down in Tennessee
# And right now where I'm right where I wanna be
# I've never felt so loved, so peaceful and so free
# Hey there ain't no doubt that God's been good to me
# 'Cause he put me smack dab in the middle of Paradise
# In the heart of the city where my dreams have come alive
# And everything I have, and everything I see
# Is just another reminder that God's been good to me
# This golden road's been long
# And sometimes I've lost my way
# I've been down some darkened detours
# Leanin' heavy on my faith
# But where the devil had me chained
# Lord your love done set me free
# Hallelujah! God's been good to me
# [REPEAT CHORUS TWICE]
> Keith urban
# So much for never makin' the same mistake
# I can't believe I'm here again
# So much for ever thinkin' that I could change
# My good intentions still remain in chains
# She's gotta be over me now
# Probably moved on with her life
# Found someone she knows she can believe
# God I would give anything if I could just go back again
# And be the man she needed me to be
# I thought I was a hero
# I played him well
# He saves the day but not himself
# I acted out the lover
# My finest part
# Had all the lines but not the heart
# No look where we are
# [REPEAT CHORUS]
# Be the man that she could trust, who put her first
# Who tamed his demons, who healed her hurts
# In health and sickness, who helped her grow
# With no resentment, true repentance, God as my witness
# [REPEAT CHORUS TWICE]
# She needed me to be
# She needed me to be, oh
# Whoa, hallelujah
# Yeah, I could be that man she needed me, she needed me to be

# But he got busy and let down the gaurds.

# I need attention, from you, it's just the little things we do, pay attention it's on you,
# Cause i can't help it i just like it when you do, yeah.

# But sometimes you forget and i get tired.
# If he was out of sight and out of mind.
# So dawlin listen and just make it right.

# There is nothing special about me
# I am just a little star
# If it seems like I’m shining it’s probably
# a reflection of something you already are
# I forget about my self sometimes when there’s so many others around
# When deep inside it feels the darkest
# That is where I can always be found 3x
# (Chorus)
# Just keep trying & trying
# It’s just a matter of timing
# Though the grinding is tiring
# Don’t let it stop you from smiling
# Just keep trying & trying
# Sooner or later you’ll find it
# It’s surprising how inspiring
# It is to see you shining
# Cause in the dark of night you're all i can see
# and you sure look like a star to me
# There is nothing special about me
# I am just a lil star
# If you try to reach out and touch me
# you'll see that I'm not really that far
# Oh I may not be the brightest
# Nor am I the last one you see
# But as long as you notice
# That’s just fine with me
# Everything just fine with me 2x
# (Chorus)
# Just keep trying & trying
# It’s just a matter of timing
# Though the grinding is tiring
# Don’t let it stop you from smiling
# Just keep trying & trying

# It’s surprising how inspiring
# It is to see you shining
# Cause in the dark of night you're all i can see
# and you sure look like a star to me
# There is nothing special about me
# I am just a lil star
# I’m a running and jumpin’
# But barely getting, getting over the bar
# I may not be much more than that
# And but that's in good time
# But until then i'm guilty
# And bein humans my crime
# Just being human that is my crime x2
# (Chorus)
# Just keep trying & trying
# It’s just a matter of timing
# Though the grinding is tiring
# Don’t let it stop you from smiling
# Just keep trying & trying

# Somebody made me an offer and I accepted
# Forever in debted to weapon
# Love, honor, and respected
# But his image was different than what his character reflected
# Word is he’s seven-thirty his hands never dirty
# All I know this so called psycho never hurt me
# Touch me down to tips, shopping sprees on Fifth
# With enough dough that could be carry out on forklifts
# Earnt his trust, together till we turn to dust
# Until his theory disintegrated and burnt to crust
# What? What?
# Death to a soft heart
# That’s what I vow to you
# The vows I vow to you
# Amazing how it’s true
# Talk goes on our phone
# Just to remind you
# That I’m behind you
# The FEDS won’t find you
# 1 -	Relax my love
# The love I have for you is like the Mafia
# For you I’d testify
# I’d lie for you of course
# Since my love is like the Mafia
# And for you I will fight
# Mister and Misses, but I wonder where the bliss is
# Sealed in blood and Cordion kisses
# The shit I witnessed
# Would give a bitch morning sickness
# Decomposed bodies thrown in the ditches
# As for snitches ain’t nothing lower than that
# Intentions to squeal on your fam make you low as a rat
# Got cappos for flaming at those
# Lame ass hoes, so you know next time keep your trap close
# What would you doubt for?
# I’d never lie to you
# Of course I’d die for you
# I’d be your eye for you
# My love won’t stop short
# I’ll raise our sons for you
# I’ll save our ones for you
# Load up your guns for you
# Repeat 1 (2x)
# Riches, tradition niggas once held dear
# Let it be known that your name alone spell fear
# Gun for gun, hundred to one forget about it
# Petty shit, rise above and get up out it
# Could give a shit about it
# Time to focus a foe
# Many lives bought and sold
# Fortunes favor the bold
# Connected like phone lines
# To racketeering to known crimes
# Winners turning long shots to gold mines
# The high speed chases
# I’ll do them just like you
# I’ll give them dust like you
# Turn around and bust like you
# Then I’ll deserve it
# Every time I get high
# Repeat 1

# Don’t wake me

# I don’t see you
# I can’t feel you
# I’m alone for real in my mind
# I’ll feel this all night
# When my life takes flight
# This isn’t just in your mind
# We’re suspended from space and time
# I feel like I’m falling
# What happens when I hit?
# Must mean then that’s it
# This black abyss, this pit
# It all seems shades of gray
# I’m never ready for light of day

# We’re suspended from space and time
# This isn’t just in your mind
# We’re suspended from space and time
# Why do you hurt me?

# Why you smile at me?
# Show your fallacies
# Dreams hold me down

# When reality will wake me
# I don’t know

# We’re suspended from space and time
# This isn’t just in your mind
# We’re suspended from space and time
# Am I dreaming?
# If so, then why?
# My bodies back on Earth
# Only spirits can fly
# Soaring through dimensions of love
# Kinds only my father speaks of
# Scenery changes, spins and roll
# So does the color of our soul
# I know how this must make you feel
# You hate me but believe me this is real

# Please tell me what happened
# What makes you think
# You'd get away with that
# Talking to my best friend
# Behind my back
# Look waht you did to us
# look what you did to me
# What a wonderful love loss
# wouldn't you agree
# She introduced me to you
# Said you were just friends
# She showed me you were the one for me until the end
# Now I should have known
# By the magic between you two
# That angel faces like yours can lie too
# Can lie too

# Wouldn't you agree
# Wouldn't you agree
# Wouldn't you agree
# Wouldn't you agree
# Wouldn't you agree
# When I see my friends
# They've got to know
# I not only lost a friend
# But now my hearts about to explode
# Now there's something I'd like to say before I make my alternative
# Oh God
# Oh God
# Do you see that
# Did you see that
# There they go
# There they go
# How could you do this to me
# You kept lyin in my face
# I thought you were my best friend
# Behind my back

# Or just a beautiful disaster
# He's magic and myth

# And it’s not too long before you point it out
# I cannot cry
# Because I know that’s weakness in your eyes
# I’m forced to fake
# A smile, a laugh, every day of my life
# My heart can’t possibly break
# When it wasn’t even whole to start with
# I watched you die
# I heard you cry every night in your sleep
# I was so young
# You should have known better than to lean on me
# You never thought of anyone else
# You just saw your pain
# And now I cry in the middle of the night
# For the same damn thing
# Because of you
# Because of you
# Because of you I am afraid
# Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk
# Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don’t get hurt
# Because of you I try my hardest just to forget everything
# Because of you
# I don’t know how to let anyone else in
# Because of you
# I’m ashamed of my life because it’s empty
# Because of you I am afraid
# Because of you

# I wonder how I ever made it through a day
# How did I settle for a world in shades of grey
# When you go in circles all the scenery looks the same
# And you don't know why
# Then I looked into your eyes
# Where the road stretched out in front of me
# And I realized
# (chorus)
# I never lived before your love
# I never felt before your touch
# I never needed anyone to make me feel alive
# But then again, I wasn't really living
# I never lived before your love
# I wanted more than just an ordinary life
# All of my dreams seemed like castles in the sky
# I stand before you and my heart is in your hands
# And I don't know how
# I survived without your kiss
# 'Cause you've given me a reason to exist
# (chorus)
# And I don't know why
# Why the sun decides to shine
# But you breathed your love into me just in time
# I never lived before your love
# I never felt before your touch
# I never needed anyone to make me feel alive
# But then again, I wasn't really living
# I never lived, i never lived, before your love

# Seems like just yesterday
# You were a part of me
# I used to stand so tall
# I used to be so strong
# Your arms around me tight
# Everything it felt so right
# Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong
# Now I can’t breathe
# No I can’t sleep
# I’m barely hanging on
# Here I am
# Once again
# I’m torn into pieces
# Can’t deny it
# Can’t pretend
# Just thought you were the one
# Broken up deep inside
# But you won’t get to see the tears I cry
# Behind these hazel eyes
# I told you everything
# Opened up and let you in
# You made me feel alright for once in my life
# Now all that’s left of me
# Is what I pretend to be
# So together but so broken up inside
# Cause I can’t breathe
# No I can’t sleep
# I’m barely hanging on
# Swallow me then spit me out
# For hating you, I blame myself
# Just seeing you it kills me now
# No I don’t cry

# Grew up in a small town
# And when the rain would fall down
# I'd just stare out my window
# Dreamin' of what could be
# And if I'd end up happy
# I would pray
# Trying hard to reach out
# But, when I tried to speak out
# Felt like no one could hear me
# Wanted to belong here
# But something felt so wrong here
# So I prayed I could break away
# [chorus]
# I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
# I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
# And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
# And break away
# Out of the darkness and into the sun
# But, I won't forget all the ones that I love
# I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
# And break away
# Wanna feel the warm breeze
# Sleep under a palm tree
# Feel the rush of the ocean
# Get on board a fast train
# Travel on a jetplane, far away
# And break away

# I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
# I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
# And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
# And break away
# Out of the darkness and into the sun
# I won't forget all the ones that I love
# I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
# And break away
# Buildings with a hundred floors
# Swinging round revolving doors
# Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
# But, gotta keep moving on, moving on
# Fly away, break away
# [chorus 2]
# I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
# Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta
# Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
# And break away
# Out of the darkness and into the sun
# But, I won't forget of the place I come from
# I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
# And break away

# But like a drug that makes you blind
# It'll fool ya every time

# The trouble with love is
# It can tear you up inside
# Make your heart believe a lie
# It's stronger than your pride
# The trouble with love is
# It doesn't care how fast you fall
# And you can’t refuse the call
# See you've got no say at all
# Now I was once a fool it's true
# I played the game by all the rules
# But now my world’s a deeper blue
# I'm sadder but I'm wiser too
# I swore I'd never love again
# I swore my heart would never mend
# Said love wasn’t worth the pain
# But then I hear it call my name
# [chorus]
# Every time I turn around
# I think I've got it all figured out
# My heart keeps callin'
# And I keep on fallin'
# Over and over again
# This sad story always ends the same
# Me standin' in the pourin' rain
# It seems no matter what I do
# It tears my heart in two

# Some say love, it is a river, that drowns a tender reef.
# Some say love, it is a razor, that leeds a soul to bleed.
# Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need.
# I say love, it is a flower, and you it's only seed.
# It's the soul, afraid of dreaming, that never learns to dance.
# It's the soul, afraid of waking, that never takes a chance.
# It's the one, who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give,
# And the soul, afraid of dyin' that never learns to live.
# When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long,
# And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong,
# Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snow
# Lies the seed that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the Rose.

# He picked me up around a quarter to nine,
# I was a little shocked that he was right on time.
# He was really well mannered as he opened my door,
# He seemed like the man I was looking for.
# He took me to a fancy restaurant,
# And told me to order anything I want.
# I went to the bathroom and called a couple of friends,
# And said: 'Oh my god he's such a gentleman'
# He want to have a good time,
# Ass I was drinking his wine.
# And then I started to feel really sleepy,
# And he had this creepy look in his eyes.
# [chorus 2x]
# So don't touch me while I'm sleeping babe,
# I just wake up and break your neck.
# It won't be worth the costs you made,
# Cause this will be the date you never forget.
# I woke up in the morning about half past eight,
# And I couldn't remember what happened to my date.
# My stomach was boozy and it didn't feel right,
# I couldn't recall a single thing from last night.
# My best friend Suzie called me on the phone,
# And said: 'Girl you really had it going on'.
# If you could imagine the f***ing look on my face,
# When I finally realized I was a victim of date rape.
# I went straight to his work and shoved his face to the wall,
# 'I hope you had a good time mother f***er, now it's time to say goodbye to your balls'.
# [chorus 2x]
# The moral of the story, to make myself clear,
# Is that all you rapist assholes better run with fear.
# I would think twice before your next date,
# Cause you'll just end up someone's bi*** in cellblock eight.
# So don't touch me while I'm sleeping babe,
# I just wake up and break your neck.
# So don't touch me while I'm sleeping babe,

# When the whole world wants you to stay the same
# I guess you just take the blame
# Of being someone who had to find her own way
# In your dreams you're fabulous

# See Alice had to go to Wonderland
# To sip on some thee who left her in a trance yeah
# In Suburbia It always stays the same
# How can anybody ever change
# Uh oh uh oh uh

# When the world wants you to stay the same
# Uh oh uh oh uh
# Life for you is just a great big game
# You have no control and all you feel is shame
# Don't try to numb the pain
# Tomorrow comes and you will be ok
# In your dreams you're fabulous

# See Alice had to go to Wonderland
# To sip on some thee who left her in a trance yeah

# Love of my you are
# Sunlight, my shining star
# All of the world to me
# All I could ever need
# Lately I can feel you've grown away from me
# And inside I pray it's not too late to find a remedy
# Don't wanna live a lie
# I don't wanna say goodbye
# So how can I start again
# And how will my heart mend
# Here I am alone with only memories
# So I'm searching just to find a way to keep you here with me
# So I close my eyes
# And I go back in time
# When our love was strong
# Before our hearts went wrong
# I keep holding on to how it used to be
# So lay me down and take me to a dream
# Dreams that you're holding me
# Dreams that won't ever be
# Visions of loving you
# Wanting to make them true
# I find myself believing you'll come back to me
# Cause I'm trying not to feel the pain, that loneliness can bring
# So I close my eyes
# And I go back in time
# When our love was strong
# Before our hearts went wrong
# I keep holding on to how it used to be
# So lay me down and take me to a dream
# It's so hard to make it through the day without you
# So I pray for night to dream you're here with me, with me
# So I close my eyes
# And I go back in time
# When our love was strong
# Before our hearts went wrong
# I keep holding on to how it used to be
# So lay me down and take me to a dream
# So lay me down and take me to a dream

# Hmm, whoa, yeah, oh baby, hmm, oh
# I read you wrong
# You said you'd only be away a while
# But the days turned into weeks
# And all the weeks into miles
# Baby why?
# You could've told me you were telling me goodbye
# Could've come clean and let me walk away in style, oh
# Funny thing is
# While I was missing you
# While I was figuring what I was gonna do
# 1 - I got wise, I got hip
# I caught on to your tricks
# I got over it real quick, yeah baby
# While you were gone
# Now I'm cool, can't you tell
# Feel so good about myself
# A funny thing happened to me baby
# While you were gone
# Oh, you looked surprised
# Like no one ever left you and survived, no
# Well leaving me alone has kind of opened my eyes
# Baby you, you gave me the time to find somebody new
# And I found strength inside me I never knew, oh
# Funny thing is
# While he was holding me
# While he was showing me how it's suppose to be
# Repeat 1
# Repeat 1 with ad-libs by Kelly
# Didn't freak, didn't cry
# I just held my head up high
# I learned how to say goodbye
# While you were gone
# Had time on my hands
# Baby don't you understand
# A funny thing happened to me baby
# While you were gone
# Had nothing but time on my hands
# Learned how to understand boy
# Got over you, got over you, oh
# While he was holding me
# While he was showing me how it's suppose to be
# Oh baby
# Repeat 1
# While you were gone, oh
# Learned to lie, learned a lesson
# Learned how to get along, learned how to be strong
# Learned how to love myself, while you were gone, ooh, oh

# VERSE 1
# It's been a long time since we started
# And all of the hurting we've been through I find that I still in love with you
# Searchin' and searchin', looking for better
# Greener pastures never grew cause everything I needed I already had with you
# CHORUS
# Been around and tried to find someone to replace the love that made us one
# No one else could ever make me whole, you for me and only me for you
# Come to me and we can start things new, heaven knows the way that I miss you
# Baby please don't take your love from me, Only you can make my life complete
# VERSE 2
# I've learned a lesson, never to let the one you love slip away
# Oh baby, it took this tragedy
# For me to see that you are the only one, baby you complete me
# BRIDGE
# I never knew a love, until you came and showed me what it was
# And I'll never let you go, never again
# I promise you this time, forever
# We'll make it last and things will be better
# Better thatn before

# Iako vec dugo nije tu,
# Srce jos ne prestaje da voli
# Da voli nju.
# Nije lako naci prave rijeci
# Ove noci kad se dijeli sve.

# From rape
# To right in.
# To real, to live.
# Should i lie down or stand up
# And walk around again?
# My eyes finally wide open up.
# My eyes finally wide open shut.
# To find the fount of sound
# That hears the touch of my tears.
# Smells the taste of all we waste
# Could feed the others.
# But we smother each other
# With the nectar and pucker the sour
# Sugar sweet weather, blows through our trees, swims through our seas,
# Flies to the last gasp we left on this earth,
# It's a long lonely journey from death to birth
# It's a long lonely journey from death to...
# It's a long lonely journey from death to birth
# Oh, it's a long lonely journey from death to...birth
# Should i die again? should i die around?
# Pounds of matter wailing to space
# I know i'll never know until i come face to face
# With my own cold dead face
# Oh, with my own wooden case.
# You are with me, with me, ooh, ohh, hmm
# I'm mourning you ooh, ooh, ohh, hmm

# I've always said that I believe
# Anything can happen
# But lately I'd been wonderin'
# If that's really true
# For a boy
# Time can be a lovely dance
# But suddenly the music can fade
# 'N leave a man alone
# And dreamless
# Until he only sees
# That he's used up all his chances
# After all
# Till now
# Only a miracle could do
# To save the man
# I've turned into
# Won't somebody let me know
# Where's my miracle?
# Love,
# It always sang so easy
# Just like a child who plays with
# Imaginary friends
# I could see
# The face of someone I believed
# But only in the words of a song
# Then she came along
# And got me dreamin'
# 'N that's when you began
# 'N when I held you
# I held a miracle in my hand
# Till then
# Only a miracle could do
# What I have finally found in you
# And I gotta let you know
# I believe again

# Some lessons are forever
# Never need to change
# Write and the word is written
# Then we turn the page
# But some lessons take forever
# Time and time again
# Caught in a battle that you can't surrender
# And can never win
# You tried to make me the boy of your dreams
# The ones that you never could find
# You thought you saw your face in mine
# The more we try, the more we just get lonely
# Though you've shown me how
# The things you say are true
# The lesson learned
# Is no concern
# If you don't even know me
# To need love is all I really learned from you
# The more we try, the more we just get lonely
# Though you've shown me how
# The things you say are true
# The lessons learned
# Are no concern
# Cause you don't even know me
# Sure you've done what you can do
# But when all our time is through
# To be loved is all I ever needed of you

# Sunny days and starry nights
# Ald lazy afternoons
# You're countin' castles in the clouds
# And hummin' little tunes
# But somehow, right before your eyes
# The summer fades away
# Everything is different
# And everything has changed
# If you feel lost and on your own
# And farr from home
# You're never alone, you know
# Just think of your friends
# The ones who care
# They all will be waiting there
# With love to share
# And your heart will lead you home
# Funny how a photograph
# Can take you back in time
# To places and embraces
# That you thought you'd left behind
# They're trying to remind you
# That you're not the only one
# No one is an island
# When all is siad and done
# There'll come a day
# When you're losing your way
# And you won't know where you belong
# They say that "Home is where the heart is"
# So follow your heart
# And you know that you can't go wrong
# If you feel lost and on your own
# And far from home
# You're never alone, you know
# Just think of your friends
# The ones who care
# They all will be waiting there
# With love to share
# And you heart will lead you
# If you lost and on your own
# And far from home
# You're never alone, you know
# Just think of your friends
# The ones who care
# They all will be waiting there
# With love to share
# And your heart will lead you

# i just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
# (yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in)
# i pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then i followed it in
# i watched myself crawlin' out as i was a-crawlin' in
# i got up so tight i couldn't unwind
# i saw so much i broke my mind
# i just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in

# Lady I'm your knight in shining armor  And I love you
# You have made me what I am   And I am yours
# My love there's so many ways I want  To say I love you
# Let me hold in my arms forever more
# You have gone and made me such a fool
# I'm so lost in your love  And oh we belong together
# Won't you believe in my song
# Lady your love's the only love I need
# And beside me is where I want you to be
# 'Cause my love there's something
# I want you to know
# You're the love of my life You're my lady
# Lady for so many years  I thought I'd never find you
# You have come into my life  And made me whole
# Forever let me wake to see you  Each and ev'ry morning
# Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear
# In my eyes I see no one else but you
# There's no other love like our love
# And yes oh yes I always want you near me

# You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair.
# Ruby, are you contemplating going out somehere?
# The shadow on the wall tells me, the sun is going down.
# Oh, Ruby, don't take your love to town.
# It wasn't me who started that old crazy Asian war,
# but I was proud to go and do my patriotic choir.
# And yes, it's true that I am not the man I used to be.
# Oh, Ruby, I just need some company.
# It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed.
# And the wants and the needs of a woman your age, Ruby, I realize.
# But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around.
# Oh, Ruby, don't take your love to town.
# She's leaving now, 'cause I just heard the slamming of the door;
# the way I know I've heard it slam a hundred times before.
# If I could walk, I'd get my gun and put her in the ground.
# Oh, Ruby, for Gods sake, turn around.
> Kenny Rogers
# How she lays sleepy
# Stay out to the night play my songs
# Sometimes all the night seems so long
# It's good when I find it makes it home
# All alone she lays dreaming
# Try to get dressed without the light
# Quietly she said "How was you the night?"
# I came to her and said, "It was all right."
# And who is I?
# And she believes in me
# I never know just watch she sees me
# I told that someday if she was my girl
# I could change the world with my little song
# I was wrong
# But she has faith in me
# And so I know I'm trying to faith for me
# Who knows maybe I'm so special man
# If my song is right
# I can find the way while she leaves
# Stumble to the kitchen for the bite
# Oh, And sing all my guitar in the night
# Just waiting for me like a secret friend
# And there is no him
# She lays crying
# A thumb with the melody are true
# I'm toned between the things that I should do
# She says to wake her up when I'm through
# God I love it's true
# And she believes in me
# I never know just watch she sees me
# I told that someday if she was my girl
# I could change the world with my little song
# I was wrong
# While she waits for me
> Kenny Rogers
# ItÃ‚Â´s just her and the band and the clean up men
# SheÃ‚Â´s counting up her tips
# She did alright, she says goodnight
# She drives home to a 3-room flat
# Checks her machine and she feeds the cat
# SheÃ‚Â´s almost asleep before she turns out the lights.
# In her dreams she rides wild horses
# And they carry her away on the wind
# And they never make a sound
# As they fly above the ground
# Tonight she rides wild horses again.
# SheÃ‚Â´s fallen in love a time or two
# Somehow all of her dreams fell through
# But sheÃ‚Â´s strong, she carries on.
# Her life ainÃ‚Â´t always gonna be this way
# She knows sheÃ‚Â´s gonna shine someday
# But for now, sheÃ‚Â´ll escape Ã‚Â´til the dawn.
# In her dreams

# All my life was paper
# Once plan pure white
# To you move with your pen
# Changing moves now and then
# To the above was right
# And you add some music
# Every knows wasn't place
# And anybody could see
# All the changes in me
# By the look of my face
# Chorus:
# And you decorated my life
# Created the world
# Where dreams are above?
# Oh...and you decorated my life
# By painting your love
# All over my heart
# You decorated my life
# I could write with no reason
# And unfinish each song
# There was no harmony
# Right from nothing to me
# Until you came along
# And you brought out the colors
# While the gentle surprise
# Now I'm able to see all things like can be
# Shining soften in your eyes

# But for me it isn't over at all
# I lie awake and struggle every night
# Though it's less than what it was
# It's more than I can fight
# It's still love and it still has awesome power inside and over me
# Look inside my heart, it's still love
# Even though we're not together there's a part of me
# That's never gonna change, that's still burning with the flame
# Even though it's not the same as it was
# It's still love, to me
# Still love
# I don't know quite who's to blame
# Truth is I don't really care
# 'Cause either way the story's just the same
# I reach out for you but you're never there
# I'd like to hate you but I know that I can't
# I'm angry and I'm hurt but on the other hand
# It's still love and it still has awesome power inside and over me
# Deep inside my heart, it's still love

# [Verse 1:]
# Day n nite...
# I toss and turn, I keep stressin' my mind, mind.
# I look for peace, but see I don't attain.
# What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play.
# Now look at this...
# Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me.
# I try to run, but see I'm not that fast.
# I think the first but surely finish last, last.
# [Chorus:]
# Cause day n nite.
# The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
# He's all alone through the day n nite.
# The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite.
# Day n nite.
# The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite.
# He's all alone, some things will never change.
# The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite
# [Verse 2:]
# Hold the phone...
# The lonely stoner missed his solo doe low.
# He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shake.
# Within his dreams he sees the life he made.
# Made.
# The pain is deep...
# A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep.
# The girl he wants don't seem to want him too.
# It seems the feelings that she had are through.
# Through.
# [Chorus:]
# Cause day n nite.
# The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
# He's all alone through the day n nite.
# The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite.
# Day n nite.
# The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite.
# He's all alone, some things will never change.
# The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite
# [Verse 3:]
# Slow mo...
# When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new.
# He seems alive, though he is feelin blue.
# The sun is shinin man he's super cool.
# Cool...
# The lonely nites, they fade away he slips into his white Nikes.
# He smokes a clip and then he's on the way,
# To free his mind in search of...
# To free his mind in search of...
# To free his mind in search of...
# [Chorus:]
# Day n nite.
# The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
# He's all alone through the day n nite.

# Ain't it funny how the sun can shine and then hide away
# And it's a long way on a they say highway, I'm still runnin'
# A lonesome freeway of uncut my way, can you feel me comin'
# A tombstone ugly, and if you judge me, better watch for me comin'
# In a fifty-nine drop top blood red cadillac

# Still rockin', everybody say that
# Knock knockin', black Bobby at your door

# They used to say Ritchie boy, he got no sense
# But now they say oh Bobby man, he was my best friend

# I learned to pimp like a mack should
# I could have been a rich man like pops
# I never kissed ass and those days since passed
# Here I stand like Jesus
# I don't need this, fuck you ho's can squeeze this
# I can't believe this, I'm so wasted
# From all the fruits of life that I've tasted
# Never a clone on the microphone
# I got shit built up cause I never felt loved at home
# And all alone's how I spent my free time
# Writin' freak rhymes and drinkin' cheap wine
# Easy whips and a cracker
# I'm the master blaster, no one cuts faster
# The king of disaster is who I am ho
# And I'll be rippin' the fuckin' rhymes
# And I'll make your mother shit her pants bro
# So, so, you better watch your back
# Watch for me comin', watch for me comin'
# In a fifty-nine drop top blood red cadillac

# Get a map to the stars, find Heidi Fiest
# And if the price is right I'm gonna make my bid boy
# And let Cali-for-ny-aye know why they call me
# Cowboy baby
# With the top let back and the sunshine shining
# Cowboy baby
# West coast chillin with the Boone's Wine
# I wanna be a Cowboy baby
# Ridin' at night 'cause I sleep all day
# Cowboy baby
# I can smell a pimp from a mile away
# Yeah...Kid Rock...you can call me Tex
# Rollin' sunset woman with a bottle of Becks
# Seen a slimmy in a 'vette, rolled down my glass
# And said, "Yeah this dick fits right in your ass"
# No kiddin', gun slingin', spurs hittin' the floor
# Call me Hoss, I'm the Boss, with the sauce in the horse
# No remorse for the sherrif, in his eye I ain't right
# I'm gonna paint his town red, and paint his wife white HUH
# Cause chaos, rock like Amadeus
# Find West Coast pussy for my Detroit players
# Mack like mayors, ball like Lakers
# They told us to leave, but bet they can't make us
# Why they wanna pick on me...lockin me up and sniffin away my key
# I ain't no G, I'm just a regular failure
# I ain't straight outta Compton I'm straight out the trailer
# Cuss like a sailor...drink like a Mick
# My only words of wisdom are just, "Suck My Dick."
# I'm flickin' my Bic up and down that coast and
# Keep on truckin' until it falls into motion
# Cowboy
# With the top let back and the sunshine shining
# Cowboy
# Spendin' all my time at Hollywood and Vine
# Cowboy
# Ridin' at night 'cause I sleep all day
# Cowboy

# Somedays I'm gone, but that's where I am
# I'm fit to slip another rippin rhyme
# I'm so ahead of the game, I feel left behind
# Another dime to boost, I got boots of lead

# I wanna go back
# I wanna go back
# Uh cause I remember way back when
# Got kicked out the crib and had a place to stay
# In the Clem with some friends George and Jay
# It was a funky fresh crew and I'd DJ
# What a shock it was to be on the set
# Comin from a nice home now livin in the projects
# No regrets cause I learned alot
# And I earned alot in the parking lot
# Doin dirt for the O.G's slangin rock
# They used to call me that little white kid
# Who could rock on the two turntables
# And that ain't no fable
# Watchin Eddie Murphy instead of Clark Gable
# My whole life style switched Hoss
# Puttin in hours at the 76 car wash
# But I could never wait for them weekends to come
# Dum ditty dum ditty ditty dum dum
# Boom, boom, the bass went
# On turntables fuckin it up in Duke's basement
# Groove time productions, we kept the jam jumpin
# Open up your ears Im tryin to tell you somethin
# And give some love back to those that loved me
# 206 Court street and my second mom Tracy
# Little Keesha and Cole
# My mellow blow, and my homegirl Flo
# Rock round see, you could find me some
# But I kept my tables in the crib when I wasnt in the club
# Tom Whit and Mike Shafer used to give me rides
# And buy me groceries when I didn't have no paper
# And I'm grateful for this
# Sometimes I look back and it's these times I miss
# Making demos on my old four track
# Sometimes I cant help but think, I Wanna Go Back
# I Wanna Go Back...back in the time
# I Wanna Go Back
# I Wanna Go Back...go way back way back y'all
# I Wanna Go Back...back in the time
# I got kicked out again for bein fly
# Got invited to stay with Tony and Eli
# And they treated me like brothers
# R-I-P to their cool ass mother
# An my brother din dada
# For the homies ain't here I still gotta lot of love
# I wanna go back, way back
# And change things and bring y'all back
# I'm pourin beer out for y'all
# I'm singin I saw the light from my cousin Paul
# Life brings alot of tragedy
# I look around at times and its so sad to see
# A wasted life, or a broken home
# But all I can do is take care of my own
# I feel so alone like a stranger
# And sometimes I express my love through my anger
# And I lost alot of friends for this
# Blackman, T-Bone, Ernest KDC, and Chris
# And the rest of the Beast crew
# I aint sayin that I'm wrong, but I still got love for you
# Cause I remember how it used to be
# Make way motherfuckers beast crew's in the party
# To the right, to the left
# Many black men and Funk Daddy Def Stef
# And sometimes I feel blessed for sure
# To a been a part of one of raps last great tours
# Ice Cube, Too Short, D-Nice, yo yo
# Kid Rock and it dont stop
# I Wanna Go Back...back in the time
# I Wanna Go Back
# I Wanna Go Back...go way back way back y'all
# I Wanna Go Back...back in the time
# I remember litte Robert, cause I stayed with him
# I used ta go and see Campbell, when I need a trim
# And when times got grim and seen that I lost my way
# I used to get blown of with Reve
# Bumpin' shoulders and slappin' hands
# Willie Knight had a disco, right in his basement man
# Them New Haven jams
# Me and Blackman running crazy scams
# Not a black or white thing, a wrong or right thing
# Just makin' that money, and pullin them honies
# Spandex shorts and the halter tops
# Slanging them rocks and runnin from the cops
# The only white kid walkin round on the block
# Cruisin in Amp's low ridin ragtop
# Go see Howard for what ya need
# Underage buyin forties and bags of weed
# Late night liquor from Bubba Coles
# People used to say, Rock you got soul
# Vince looked out and so did Lou
# Had a studio budget from the cocaine loot
# Chuck D and Murph were the original three
# And now Richard D and Kracker are down with me
# I got a studio record and a taste of fame
# But when I roll throught the Clem it's all the same
# Even though things change, you know I ain't forgot
# Cause the love from the past gave birth to Kid Rock
# But it's hard to go back to the things I knew
# Cause tha me life a have now lives for two
# Yeah, and that's where I'm at
# I Wanna Go Back...back in the time

# I Wanna Go Back...go way back way back y'all

# Breaking the silence is the hardest thing in life
# Knowin' that you're wrong, feelin' like you can't go on
# I've been a victim so many times
# But I'm man enough to know when I'm wrong
# With the fresh cut mullets, back row in sight
# Pass the packed bullet, I'm gonna rock all night
# Uptight right wingers, tryin' to say I'm what
# But I'm a flight bound singer not giving a fuck
# Hard luck of the devil with the grace of God
# On a level of Oz, and it makes you nod
# With the body of a sinner, mind of a saint
# I'm everything you love, everything you hate
# Hit a lot of curves, hard roads and hills
# Got nerves of steel, and watched time stand still
# It took too long, but I stood my height
# You can say I'm wrong, but you ain't right
# You ain't right, you, you, you ain't right
# You ain't right, right
# You ain't, you ain't, you ain't, right
# You ain't, you ain't, you ain't, right
# You ain't, you ain't, you ain't, right
# You can save the environment with all your wit
# But can you save your children from a world of bullshit
# You look at me with a loss for love
# But if you took me out would your kid still do drugs
# You wanna point your finger in the unclear
# You wanna point your finger in the unclear
# You wanna point your finger in the unclear
# You ought to point your finger in the mirror
# You wanna trip, quit, cause I'm a keep rippin'
# You can bitch but the strippers gon' keep strippin'
# I'm singing songs in the key of life
# And you can say I'm wrong but you ain't right
# You ain't right, you, you, you ain't right
# You ain't right
# We just can't do, come on now, right
# Rock on
# Cowboy baby, cowboy baby

# Our lesson begins in the small town of Romeo, Michigan
# 1985
# Several years ago deep on the westside of Detroit
# I reigned soarly with the old and new school rules of hip hop
# Don Balow, Wes Chill, and my DJ JC Fresh
# Rockin microphones and turntables day by day and night by night
# But still the force was not complete
# That's when we met a homeboy by the name of Kid Rock
# Others had doubts and laughs because he was white
# But I knew what time it was, so I put him behind the turnatbles
# And this is all he had to say
# Fu, Fu, Fu, Fuck, Fuck, Fu Fuck, ...Fuck Off
# This Is The History Of Rock

# When the sunshine showed her face I felt like I was ready to die
# Went looking for a place to hide, a hole I could crawl inside
# Long lines, whiskey bottles, and the same old song
# I smell death in the air, and I know it won't be long
# And I could say I'm trying to change but that's just another lie
# It's been a day and a half and I'm still high
# And I feel like Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin'
# Like Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin'
# J-J-Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin'
# Like Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin' through my veins
# When the daylight disappeared, I took a good look inside
# Behind my pride, I sat down and cried
# I know I'm not a fool, but I don't know what's wrong
# Maybe it's time to pack and just move on
# And I could say I'm trying to change but that's just another lie
# I'm looking for someone to tell me why
# And I feel like Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin'
# Like Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin'
# J-J-Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin'
# Like Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin' through my veins
# A river runnin', a river runnin' through my veins
# A river runnin' a through my veins
# A river that's runnin' through my veins

# I was hiding from the sun once again
# I was running from time my friend
# I've lost another war
# So I poured one more, and went home drunk again
# She was up when the key hit the lock
# And the clock looked at me just like the devil in disguise
# I saw it in her eyes
# She'd be gone before the evening
# So I poured another strong one
# And chopped a line from here to Texas
# Cause I've lost another good one
# She's on the midnight train to Memphis
# With a brand new start
# I swore I'd love from the heart
# I meant to change my ways
# But I've seen better days
# Than the one that's here this morning, mmhm
# With a wife and kids at home
# With a job somewhere on some assembly line
# I wish I had that life
# I bet you wish you had mine
# So I poured another tall one
# And chopped a line from here to Texas
# Cause I've lost another good one
# She's on the midnight train to Memphis
# Dude, what station is this, K snooze
# Kid Rock, I thought he was the American bad ass
# He's putting me to sleep
# Nudge me if he gets over five decibels
# I knew his first album was the good one
# But that's the way I am, and this is how I jam
# All across the land from Alabam' to bandstand
# Doped up rebel with an attitude, shit
# So fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch
# I won't switch, won't quit no vices
# Flip the script cause I'm a slice the righteous
# Haven't you heard I don't refrain
# Free as a bird, and so I won't change
# Livin' it up, givin' it up, fuckin' shit up, what
# I'm a run the track from the D to Nantucket
# So fuck it, if you don't dig that you can suck it
# Yeah, and it don't, and it don't
# With an old suitcase, I swear I'll leave this place
# I'll get you back in time, can't drink you off my mind
# So I'll see you when I'm sober
# I been looking for some reasons
# But I ain't found one down in Texas
# I been changing with the seasons
# Walked in a new line back to Memphis

# I need somebody won't you help me
# I need somebody won't you tell me who I am
# I've been livin a lie so long it seems I've lived a life time
# If you could see what I feel it would make your ghetto lood like heaven
# And I believe it stems down from my family situation
# I never liked my old man
# I couldn't stand to be around him
# Sometimes I sit all alone just starin at his picture, yeah
# My heart turns to stone and I think of this
# I need somebody won't you help me
# I need somebody won't you tell me who I am
# You never loved me, you never held me tight
# Instead you shook me like a beast to wake me up at night
# You tried to make me think that your ways were best
# When all I was was an outlet for all your stress
# Life it's the ultimate sin
# A game with no rules that you're expected to win
# My personal hell's hidden with a grin
# Dad take the stand and let the trial begin
# You said that oil and water don't mix though it seems cool
# Keep with your own and don't fuck up our gene pool
# UYoushould've went to school like your bigger brother
# But you played the fool with a different color
# Runnin' ship with a whip
# I tried to keep up but I kept getting tripped
# Money made you so wise
# How could you look thru my face and not see your own eyes
# Do as I say and not as I do
# But I can't cuz when I look in the mirror I see you
# And oh the pain how it hurts
# It was always your home and your business that came first
# You said a man is as good as his word
# But your mind was closed and mine never heard
# My visions blurred, thoughts obscured
# And with my blinders down I strain from the heard
# They say the nut don't fall far from the tree
# Look at u then look at me...
# You ain't nothin to me you've never been to me
# And all you ever gave a damn about was money see
# So now fuck you man you ain't shit to me
# And it's the day that I die of this hate that I'm free
# Now I know growin up son that it ain't always been easy
# And I know at times I was not always there for you
# No we never spent much time just talkin or havin a good time
# But understand growin up son I never had a dime
# So I worked my ass off and I put myself through college
# And everything I have to this day u know I built it all
# Oh I wish I could go back and change the years that's lost between us
# I wish I could take back some of the things I said to you
# Son I said I'm sorry but still you resent me so
# Son I said I'm sorry and why do you resent me so
# I always loved you I always cared for you
# Just never wanted you to go through what I've been through
# I tried to raise my fuckin family just the best I know
# And now I'm hated like the devil and for why I don't know
# Dahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
# Alright, get down baby
# Yeaaaaahhhhhhh
# I need somebody won't you help me
# I need somebody won't you tell me who I am
# I need somebody please, please help me
# I need somebody you must tell me who I am
# Hey, hey, hey
# Tell me who I am
# Hey, hey
# Tell me who I am
# I am, I am
# Tell me who I am, am, am
# Tell meeeee
# Tell meeeee
# A Minute Or So After The Song Is Over -
# If it looks good, you'll see it
# If it sounds good, you'll hear it
# If it's marketed right, you'll buy it
# But if it's real, you'll feel it
> Kid Rock
# I've been sittin' here
# Tryin' to find myself
# I get behind myself
# I need to rewind myself
# Lookin' for the payback
# Listen for the playback
# They say that every man bleeds just like me
# And now I feel like number one
# Yet I'm last in life
# I watch my younger son
# And it helps to pass the time
# I take too many pills to help to ease the pain
# I made a couple of dollar bills still I feel the same
# Everybody knows my name
# They say it way out loud
# A lot of folks fuck me
# It's hard to hang out in crowds
# I guess that's the price you pay
# To be some big shot like I am
# Outskirt stands and one night stands
# Still I can't find love
# And when your walls come tumbling down
# I will always be around
# And when your walls come tumbling down
# I will always be around
# People don't know about the things I say and do
# They don't understand about the shit that I've been through
# It's been so long since I've been home
# I've been gone, I've been gone for way too long
# Maybe I forgot all things I miss
# Oh somehow I know there's more to life than this
# I said it too many times
# And I still stand firm
# You get what you put in
# And people get what they deserve
# Still I ain't seen mine
# No I ain't seen mine
# I've been giving just ain't been gettin'
# I've been walking down that line
# So I think I'll keep on walking
# With my head held high
# I'll keep moving on and only God knows why
# Only God.....Only God
# Only God knows why
# Only God....knows....why, why, why only God knows why
# Take me to the river's edge
# Take me to the river, hey hey hey

# I dont need the fancy music to make mine
# Just the beat and the funky ass bass line

# Cause growin up I was never, the logical one
# Packed my shit, left home like the prodigal son
# With a bottle of jack and my shotgun strapped
# I went looking for fame and yo I never went back
# Filled with spite staying high as a kite
# I was dealin and stealin everything in sight
# Pool hustling trying to make that green
# I've been ramblin and gamblin since the age thirteen
# Working like a bitch, like a god damn tank
# Some disagree because my rents had bank
# But all that's gold don't always glitter
# So I'll take another puff from my one hitter
# I'm a slave to the trade, paid to rhyme
# Blow all my cash on cheap women and wine
# Cause money, money, money ain't shit to me
# But I gotta make a lot just to be free
# I'm here and I'm there
# I'm Kid Rock bitch and I'm everywhere
# I'm here and I'm there

# Please God please, I'll pay any cost
# If you'd just stop the world cause I wanna get off
# There's too much hardship and too much pain

# Everything is slow motion like I'm trippin on tussin
# Fussin with the girls, they waste my time
# Thrashin and bashin going out of my mind
# Crucified by the critics, everyday
# Cause I really ain't got that much to say
# I'm a slave to the trade, paid to rhyme
# I don't wear a watch and I don't keep time
# I live my life just like the skipper

# I like country, soul, rock n roll, and I love me some hip hop
# I'm a redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit
# I don't like no new wave techno bands around
# I'm a drink a couple dozen beers
# Go out and jam some gears
# I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit
# I got a bougart and west coast chopper, that sure make them bitches stare
# Got a dead flamingo wrapped around this cowboy hat I wear
# I like to cuss, yell, scream, fight and rasie all kinds of hell
# And if you ride to live, like I live to ride, then let me hear that rebel yell
# I'm a redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit
# I don't like no new wave techno bands around
# I'm a drink a couple dozen beers
# Go out and jam some gears
# I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit
# One time for your mind, yeah
# I like my whiskey straight up, daiquiri's make me ill
# And if someone touches my beaver skins I get mad enough to kill
# I got a rifle rack in my pick-up truck, I'm a four wheelin' maniac
# And if you wanna race then just name the place and I'll show you where it's at

# I think you might like to hear something from us
# Stand up, put your hands up, come on, get up
# Kid Rock's in the house, yo, ready to pick up
# The tempo and you know in so I will flow
# Somewhat unconventional but comprehendable
# I'm the presentable, the good lookin'
# The mellow yellow young fellow and I'm cookin'
# Heatin' the house up just like a hot plate
# Smooth on the groove like an ice skate
# You didn't think in a blink I'd stand here
# But now you're in fear and stand clear
# You can't come near this hot stylin'
# Groove by the kid who's smooth as a violin
# Also the perfect lyric announcer
# On the set with a cold forty ouncer
# Ready to glide from side to side
# Why, cause I step in stride
# These are the criteria I believe should be applied
# Cause I step in stride
# These are the criteria I believe should be applied
# N-N-Now yes I'm new but before I'm through
# You're gonna see I paddle my own canoe
# Cause I'm solo, a young pro on the go
# Close to an angel but I wear no halo
# I just shake, create and never act fake
# And I learned to dislike and not hate
# Because hatred leads to an uproar
# Violence is one thing I am not here for
# I'm just here flat out and to blow the roof
# Kick some watts and that's what I intend to do
# Pump it up like an air compressor
# Teach to each like a wise professor
# No job, I strive to reach high
# Make the girls in the house all sigh
# And I'll glide from side to side
# Why, cause I step in stride
# These are the criteria I believe should be applied
# Cause I step in stride
# These are the criteria I believe should be applied
# Applied, step in stride, you bet I do
# Get you high like a bottle of German Brew
# Comin' clean, new on the scene
# Makin' girls scream if you know what I mean
# Cause they dream of me to rock the place
# And put a big smile upon their face
# Any girl of any race
# But they have to like the b-b-bass
# And that's the rep I've earned and kept
# On the set, workin' up a sweat
# No Jive, Kid Rock, I've arrived
# Why, cause I step in stride
# These are the criteria I believe should be applied
# Cause I step in stride
# These are the criteria I believe should be applied

# Stop embracing all yesterdays for in the end

# Stop laboring for a single goal
# You can't depend on what the
# future holds for you
# Not physically where you are on your journey
# It's only what you make of it
# The fruits of emphasis on tomorrow
# Yield a life filled with much sorrow
# It doesn't mean you'll star the same
# You cannot force the change
# If you seek the wild horses
# Bound for uncharted courses
# You would never grab the reins
# For a chance to learn from your mistakes

# From all that you know

# Oh, no, hahaha... yeah
# It's Priest back at ya.
# The Genesis... genesis
# My Genesis, uh, uh, genesis
# Here it go baby... genesis..
# [Chorus 2X: Killah Priest]
# Back in the days, it was much like this
# Inspirations make me wanna reminisce
# It's my genesis, it's the life, it's the love
# It's my genesis, hook this mic to a plug
# [Killah Priest]
# Afros to box braids, locks and waves
# Fades, to flat tops, it came, the boxing game
# The bus stop, the pop locks and spades
# Knuckles, doin' the hustle, I chuckle
# That's me the young dude, playin' kung fu
# Run to the store to get more junk food
# Hero and a small Sundew, hard headed
# That's why I flunked school, back in the days
# When the Bishops and the Lords used to rumble
# That's a Brooklyn thing, the hoodlum reign
# Shots go off at block parties
# Muslims and God Bodies and big posses
# Different crews from different schools, it was school
# Grandma watchin' the news, I'm dodgin' principals
# Graffiti writers, guess who's on Riker's
# Guess who's pregnant? Guess who's the lifer
# To Laudi prom, robbin' the ciphers
# Don't mess with Sun God, he's a fighter
# It was, '80's, Michael Jackson and leather jackets
# Bicycle fashion, my last words of a king when he's rapping
# Swing flurries like a champ when he scrapping
# Grew up fad, notepad, that's all I had
# It's the only thing that bring me back to past
# [Chorus 2X]
# [Killah Priest]
# It's the Priest, bless like sheeps in white sheets
# Clothes fit me like robes, right to the T
# Pearls huggin', back up, me and wifey
# It's so elegant, my words add flesh to skeletons
# Once it's heard, it covers the flesh from element
# It's the medicine, take it for the soul
# It's better than gold, Proverbs, makes your pops burst
# Starbust, above God's Earth
# And the moonlight, I move like a Greek move degrees at night
# I write movies that masterpiece, the cornerstones my poem
# I lay bricks like a mason, my words can move a nation
# Throw pens out the page, the same way you pull a pen out a grenade
# And watch it explode, yo, my mind explode, divine and glow
# Back to the days, where the rhymes was made
# [Chorus 4X]
# [Outro: Killah Priest]
# singing along to the beat*
# Yo, come on, let me hear ya'll sing it, it go
# singing along to the beat*
# Heat it up, uh, Black August, take control, understand
# Words of the Proverbs, heard... yeah.. uh.
# Priesthood, where you at, boy? Yeah..
# Joe..
> Killah Priest
# [Chorus and 1/2: Killah Priest w/ sample]
# To the listeners, here's a movie
# I write in black and white, or color
# It goes deeper than Warner Bros., or Steven Spielsberg
# You can feel the words, I write rhymes you can see
# It's not just punch lines, it's a movie, it's a movie
# [sample - during chorus: Master Fool]
# For all the land there's Earth
# [Killah Priest]
# Inside my head, there's an auditorium, with rows of empty chairs
# Right above, light bulbs fill the chandeliers
# Right below, there's a balcony, that's where I would be
# I look again, now there's crowded seats
# And an audience surrounding me, the lights go low
# And out of nowhere, my notepad glows
# Then a motion screen show, my paper becomes a movie screen
# Each word is a character that plays a part in the scene
# You start to see pictures, but it's only for the listeners
# Welcome to the theater
# [Killah Priest]
# For the admission, all you gotta do is pay attention
# My ushers guide you, to where I'll be sitting
# It's the intermission, all you gotta do is listen
# To get a clear vision, the way I be spitting
# The story changes with the rhythms
# It comes at you in 3D, it's not just a CD
# It's more like DVD (to tape it), I turn radios to TV's
# My pen: the projector, and I'm the director
# Each line guides my recta, I turn looseleafs to whole movies
# Color show is Rudy, a film written by him, rated KP
# Bring your lady or your babies, sit through the album
# Turn up the volume, stare at the speakers
# Til suddenly your in the bleachers
# Lookin' at the main features, viewing the coming attractions
# Guns blastin', tons of action
# [Killah Priest]
# I got love stories that turn gory
# From Mafia hits, to politics, follow my lips
# Acknowledge my flicks, once I stopped writing, the room brightens
# I pick up my pen, then the movie ends
# I stop the flow, then the curtains close
# The audience stands and leaves the rows
# At the same time, another group comes to see the show
# I put down my pen, then the movie plays again
# It's the vision, what I'm sayin', rewind the time in your mind
# Yo, sit back, the seat reclines, you read the credits
# A barrage of letters, the ink comes up in cartoons
# I'm in a dark room, the words become characters
# Actors, with leading roles
# I talk from the bullhorn, which is the pen I hold
# Capital letters become buildings filled with children
# Or merry-go-rounds, lights, cameras, action, the stereo sound
# My pen's a wooden puppet, and I'm the ventriliquist
# I turn listeners to the vision-ists
# My hands written in scripts from Gods to gangstas
# To painters, to King Tut, what up?
# To entertainers, it's all good, when I write
# With this piece of wood, it's a movie
> Killah Priest
# [Chorus: Killah Priest]
# (People) Is the world we live in
# Full of innocent, Yasa's word, we the victims
# (6 billion people) To the suburban area
# Filled with doctors and lawyers
# Cops and judges, we all suffer from paranoia
# (6 billion people) From the White House to Hollywoods
# To everybody hood, to down south, to deep in the woods
# From my hood (people) to my hood, let's make it better, overstanding
# (People) To six million people, that on this planet
# [Killah Priest]
# As the moon appears like a pearl in the mists of the clouds
# I move up through the shadows til I'm at the cliff of the aisle
# I sit overlooking, the borough of Brooklyn
# As the Devils start to settle and the cement is pushed in
# The ghetto comes to life, you can feel it's pulse
# I hear, every corner breathing like the streets awoke
# It grabs you, it makes you, so you can't escape
# It's the phantom, it haunts us, it changes shape
# And the building's most chiling, described by children
# As the gateway to Hell, it holds the ghosts of millions
# Come close to it, it gives you the most grossest feelings
# As the black sky open up, my soul is exploding
# Back down to the surface, where these seeds are nurtured
# With alcohol and drugs, which leads to murders
# Born poor, broke and hungry that's when thieves emerges
# But to, rob their own, defeats the purpose, and
# [Killah Priest]
# I write for children, who really can't express their feelings
# I'm their voice, their thoughts, the way they talk
# I'm their worries, their fears, their dreams, nightmares
# Through that tunnel of darkness, I'm the light that's there
# Just stare, look into my endless eyes
# See a child walking on stage, his very first time
# And the same in the White House when light goes out
# The night comes down, the Earth leases unrighteous sound
# With gunshots, echoing, through the dark
# It's the sand of the ghetto's heart
# Put your ear to the ground, you can hear it pound
# Subway trains, run through the tunnels like blood through his veins
# People in cells, carry like fluid to the brain
# Clouds filled with red rain, the sewage drains as the nostrils
# And I'm the arsenal, I'm here to set fire, til the entire empire is on
> Killah Priest
# [Intro: Killah Priest]
# Yeah... yeah, Priesthood
# Uh, Get Large Productions
# Revisited, son, yo, self destruction
# It go
# [Chorus 2X: Killah Priest]
# Look at my life, Brooklyn's my wife
# Close that it's tight, in the bullpens I write, so/yo
# [Killah Priest]
# They say Heavy Mental is a classic
# My pen'll draw graphic, backwards, thinking
# Drinkin', the ink pen rap kid
# Clap ya'll rappers to the point of extinction
# Relax and listen, the flow is like hydro
# And hell is slow, puffin' out your nose
# Creatin' fogs of old school flicks, I do this for kids
# My music, my gift, broken ghettos and harsh reality
# Made me thorough, my art gallery, nine uncles
# I flunked school, robbin', rope chains, the street have no name
# Fiends that preach the dope game
# Deep like the blood of my nephew, soaked in the streets
# I heard it scream through the concrete, rest in peace
# This last release, the flesh that eat, want me
# The pen comes to me, I open my books, like scrolls of Moses
# I look, I see skulls and ghosts
# I shook, the Bible, I wrote it with hooks, come on
# [Chorus 2X]
# [Killah Priest]
# The pen, the pad, the friends I had
# To the live it ends in vag', it's like grin to a laugh
# To wild outrageous, and then I'm mad
# To a face that show expression, depression, begin to look sad
# The tears come out, it's weird, I dumb out, pretend to be glad
# Cigarette on my lips, I don't even smoke
# I leave that to Kruger, I gotta stay afloat
# Watch the way we maneuver
# Peace to Tutta, held me down in Cali
# I see the future, flee from troopers
# Revolutionary blood, sweat and tears, obsessin' with fears
# Paranoia, got me needing more lawyers
# Got me reachin' for guns, see I'm comin' for ya
# Hold up, I stargaze, into God's face
# Embrace Allah's grace, sun and moon, star gates
# Space, is my place of birth, made my way into the Earth
# Came to the lunars of kings, held coins with wings, come on
# [Chorus 2X]
# [Killah Priest]
# I gave ya'll, all of my Views of Masada, the drama
# Here's the clue, Proverbs, Priesthood, dons like Clint Eastwood
# Black August, join the shortage
# A rap athormesis, but that got restarted
# So I Revisit ya'll, with more of the God, that roar in they heart
# Yo, Priest, you still hustle, Priest, you still struggle
# Priest, you still bubble, them streets is still trouble
# Them thieves will cuff you, lock you up in pens with men
# That couple, friends will cut you
# Poor education, the ghetto is hell
# Heaven is Park Ave., the system is jail, religion wears a dark mask
# Worn by faces, wind up in newspapers
# A true gangsta, til the wheels fall off and the gats is on E
# Two gats is on me
# I kick open the door, take the whole pieces of war
# Like Larry Davis, fuck this world, I break out ya'll cages
# [Chorus 4X]
> Killah Priest
# [Intro: Killah Priest]
# Yeah, uh-huh, back again
# The Priesthood, yeah, brought it
# We up in here now, it's time to eat
# Gotta look at myself, want ya'll to turn around
# Watch this, yo
# [Chorus 4X: sample]
# Turn around, every now and then
# I get a little bit lonely
# You're never coming back..
# [Killah Priest]
# Alone and thinkin', zonin'
# Then I pick up my ink pen and hold it
# Like the bullet that went in, they blinkin', I'm frozen
# Stuck between time, the pass and the present
# From early adolesence, to fiends that's crashin' and beggin'
# A pad is my blessin' with it, I'm addin' my lessons, so vivid
# Through life, things I've done wrong, and do right
# I had a few nights, of comin' in drunk, fightin' with punks
# At club, writin' to front, stomp it with gloves
# Cats pumpin' they drugs on Ave., I jumped in the cab
# Head to the lab, grab my pen and my pad, feel the wind draft
# Dump the insensce ash inside the hour glass
# Watchin' it slowly slippin' as I drift in the past
# Watchin' the secret sands, remind me the extinction of man
# If we don't unite, I'll think of plans
# The king is a hand, the handwriting's on the wall of the project halls
# In graffiti, written like swahili
# All harmonic, Priest is like a god when he speaks
# Plants his feet on the ground, wore the crown
# All of ya'll turn around, baby
# [Chorus 4X w/ ad-libs]
# [Killah Priest]
# My verse runs deep like smack through a veteran's vein
# See cats on the train beggin' for change
# Need medicine for they pain, I'm in heavy rain
# Sweat testin' my aim, carve in my bullets with the president's name
# Destined to reign, feel guns bust while cats discuss
# About the gats they bust, and loyalty among employees
# The more weed, the more they mind's stay freed
# The more the nines get squeezed, the more the crime leads
# The more they blind me, push that light far behind me
# I seeked ashanti's and monks in the hills, I dwelled months for real
# No deal, but still hold the steel
# Sometimes I spaz out, pull my pad out
# Then my pad sprouts to a crackhouse, filled with drug dealers
# Some thugs, some killers, my pen's a paintbrush
# Colorin' the old school cats with gangstas
# For every word that I print on paper
# Is like a proverb from a prince in Asia
# [Chorus to fade w/ ad-libs]

# Ryan pump blast shattered glass in the classroom
# Penny tried to hide in a bathroom,
# Homicide scream from the hand held dragon
# Mental flame from the barrel claim 25 angel, mercy
# Long as the black board, splatter with his inside
# Never had a chance to ride his new skateboard
# Billy didn't shake lord, he fell silent
# Died in the pantomime of cold violence
# His killer didn't even blink, he couldn't think
# Even when he heard the sirens kept firing
# Pupils dilated, possessed and perspiring
# He grew up admiring, 30 auts and calicos
# AR-15 and long barreled 44's so on the story goes
# He went out in a blaze of glory
# He went out in a front page story
# He went out in a front page story

# My soul can't rest today
# I can't bring myself to pray
# I get down on my knees

# Frank, I'm sorry you didn't get to see your cell phone tape, hear yourself
# But to the mother fuckas who took Frank Williams AKA Fast Black, FUCK YOU! (Gunshot)
# Dear God, I've messed up again, I'm sassed up again
# Vodka spilling out my mouth onto my chin
# I've slipped into the darkness of the heartless
# Those barbarians carry savage weapons and they start shit
# They hearts is cold as the artic, these men motivate mobs to lynch
# These monsters are men, who I hang with
# These monsters of then are who I bang with
# Who I bang with, Crips, Bloods, BG, VL we have created our own road to hell
# We train to kill and not to feel, reacting with a mac
# But no matter who I kill I can't bring my nigga back
# My niggaz dead and I can't get my fucking head around it
# We was just smoking blunts of the best chronic
# And now I'm wearing a t-shirt with his picture on it
# Staggering about to vomit, consumed with vengeance
# With my vengeance I'm all consumed, by mid afternoon smoking blunts in my room
# To whom ever this letter may concern
# When bullets strike they burn more than the flesh of the ones hit
# You took my nigga my heart split, its broken, shattered in a million pieces
# Help me Jesus, help me Jesus, just help me Jesus, thug niggaz killers
# They victims was screaming help me Jesus

# My soul can't rest today

# you were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday
# it seemed as if perhaps i'd gone insane
# what is it about you that has commandeered my brain?
# maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way
# when i look at your face i can tell that you're not going to be stopping soon or even slowing down
# and if we keep up this pace pretty soon we'll know the name of every kid and every grown up booking house shows in their town
# and if home is really where the heart is
# then we're the smartest kids i know
# because wherever we are in this great big world
# we'll never be more than a few hours from home...
# and that's important because i need to travel
# i've had this itchin in my shoes since i was just a little kid
# and before i had a mini van i road the greyhound bus
# my mom would say "i hope some day you get paid for being kimya dawson"
# and now i do and it's not much
# but it's enough
# i've got my scrabble game, food on my plate, good friends and family
# and now there's you understanding why i do the things i do
# knowing that you do them too makes me really happy
# on the road again
# just can't wait to get on the road again
# the life i love is makin' music with my friends
# and i can't wait to get on the road again
# on the road again
# just can't wait to get on the road again
# the life i love is makin' music with my friends
# and i can't wait to get on the road again
# from a distance, the world looks blue and green
# and the snow capped mountains white
# from a distance, the ocean meets the stream
# and the eagle takes to flight

# do do do do do do do
# do do do do do do do
# i'll be your cryin' shoulder
# i'll be love's suicide
# i'll be do do do do do do
# i'll be the greatest man of your life
# 'cause i like going for hikes and riding bikes
# and playing video games in the middle of the night
# and i'll stay up late and i won't even care
# that we're getting up early to go to the state fair
# i'm gonna ride the biggest ride it'll be out of sight
# then i'll share an elephant ear with you if you'd like
# because we are alive so we've gotta live life
# to the fullest you spin the bottle and i'll dim the lights

# you're so brave
# and then you run to the right it seems there's no hope in sight

$ Remember That I Love You
# i never wanted to be better than my friends
# i just wanted to prove wrong the people in my head
# the ones who told me i'd be better off dead
# the ones who told me that i would never win
# when i delivered newspapers they said i was too slow
# when i was a barista they said i made lousy foam
# when i worked in retail they said i was a slob
# much too dumb for school and much too lazy for a job
# so i rode my bike like lightning
# and i made cappucinos that would make the angels sing
# took two showers a day and i dressed up like a princess
# shook my fist in my own face and said "i'll show you who's the best"
# i wrote the kinds of papers teachers hang up on their walls
# i was employee of the month in seven different shopping malls
# and one time, playing football, i pulled the tendons in my leg
# to prove that i was tough i hopped on one foot
# and finished up the game
# i thought if i succeeded i'd be happy and they'd go away
# but first thing every morning i'd still wake up and i'd hear them say
# "you're fat, ugly and stupid, you should really be ashamed
# no-one will ever like you, you're no good at anything"
# and sometimes i'd rise to the challenge
# but other times i'd feel so bad that i could not get out of bed
# and on the days i stayed in bed i sang and sang and sang
# about how crappy i felt, not realising how many other people would relate
# now people send me emails that say thanks
# for saying the things they didn't know how to say
# and the people in my head still visit me sometimes
# and they bring all of their friends, but i don't mind
# i play my guitar like lightning
# when i sing i like it when you sing too, loud and clear
# different voices, different tones, all saying "yeah, we're not alone"
# i got good at feeling bad and that's why i'm still here
# i got good at feeling bad and that's why i'm still here

# Throughout history, there've been many songs written about the eternal
# triangle.
# The next one tells a story of a Mister Grayson,
# a beautiful woman, and a condemned man named Tom Dooley.
# When the sun rises tomorrow, Tom Dooley must hang.
# Hang down your head Tom Dooley, hang down your head and cry,
# hang down your head Tom Dooley, poor boy, you're bound to die!
# I met her on the mountain, there I took her life.
# Met her on the mountain, stabbed her with my knife.
# Hang down your head Tom Dooley, hang down your head and cry,
# hang down your head Tom Dooley, poor boy, you're bound to die!
# This time tomorrow, Reckon where I'll be,
# hadn't I been for Grayson, I'd been in Tennessee.
# Hang down your head Tom Dooley, hang down your head and cry,
# poor boy, oh well-a-
# hang down your head Tom Dooley, poor boy, you're bound to die!
# Oh, well, now, boy.
# Hang down your head Tom Dooley, hang down your head and cry,
# poor boy, oh well-a-
# hang down your head Tom Dooley, poor boy, you're bound to die!
# This time tomorrow, Reckon where I'll be,
# down in some lonesome valley, hangin' from a white oak tree.
# Hang down your head Tom Dooley, hang down your head and cry,
# hang down your head Tom Dooley, poor boy, you're bound to die!
# Oh, well, now, boy
# Hang down your head and cry, hang down your head and cry.
# Hang down your head and cry, poor boy, you're bound to die!
# Poor boy, you're bound to die.
# Poor boy, you're bound to die.

# Daj mi povej, se spominjaš, ko smo ležali na plaži, začudeno zvezde šteli,  ki so bežale visoko. Se spominjaš poljubov, kamnov, pekočih od sonca, plesa do jutra, kdo dlje zdrži, ko vpili smo : daj, o, daj mi ! 3 prste tekile, vodo in sol, nihče od nas ni hotel domov, 3 prste tekile, vodo in sol, v deželi sanj pozabil sem naslov. Ostali so le spomini, spomini v mesečini, pozabljeni ne bodo nikoli, zakladi skriti globoko. Se spominjaš poljubov, kamnov, pekočih od sonca, plesa do jutra, kdo dlje zdrži, ko vpili smo : daj, o, daj mi ! 3 prste tekile, vodo in sol, nihče od nas ni hotel domov, 3 prste tekile, vodo in sol, v deželi sanj pozabil sem naslov.

# Johnny saw her riding on a street car named Desire
# His fate was sealed
# She could see him coming like a hundred other liars
# It was no big deal
# Rosa had a lover on the shady side of town
# Tito, he was king of the streets
# She was his possession like a jewel on his crown
# Johnny better run
# Better run
# Better hide your heart
# Better hold on tight
# Say your prayers
# 'Cause there's trouble tonight
# When pride and love battle with desire
# Better hide your heart
# 'Cause you're playing with fire
# The ride was over but the story doesn't end
# He took her heart
# She looked him in the eye
# And said they couldn't meet again
# You could see the trouble start
# The word went out that Rosa's messin' with someone
# It was on the street
# Tito looked for Johnny with a vengeance and a gun
# Johnny better run
# Better run

# A shot ran out like thunder
# And the blood was on her hands
# With nothing won
# When someone lies dying
# Lovers finally understand
# Better hide your heart...

# All the faces turn our way
# Yeah it's in their eyes, and they realize
# We can make our getaway
# When she tells me I want it...

# Kick you when you're down
# We're not for the innocent
# We're not for the innocent
# We're not for the innocent
# Let the beast run wild
# I've been damned
# I've been cursed
# I've been guilty and abused
# I spit the hangman in his face
# And hung him on his noose
# Habitual threat
# I got you in my claws
# Gonna tan your hide
# Rip the flesh off your bones
# Look me in the eye
# And you're gonna turn to stone
# You're gonna turn to stone
# We're not for the innocent
# We're not for the innocent
# We're not for the innocent
# Let the beast run wild
# Better lock up your daughters
# We're comin' to your town
# Better pray we're not around
# Let the beast run wild
# We're not for the innocent...

# From a far off galaxy, I hear you calling me
# we are on an odyssey
# Through the realms of time and space
# In that enchanted place
# You and I come face to face
# Once upon not yet, long ago someday
# Countless times we've met, met along the way
# Through the luminescent night
# On beams of neon light
# You and I in wing-ged flight
# As we cross the starry sea, powered by what we see
# Now and then, the victory
# Chorus
# There's a child in a sundress
# Looking at a rainy sky
# There's a place in the desert
# Where an ocean once danced by
# There's a song in the silence
# Weaving in and out of time
# We are notes in the music
# Searching for remembered rhyme
# On a mountain high somewhere
# Where only heroes dare
# Stand the stallion and the mare
# We have been and we shall be each other's destiny
# One another's odyssey
# Chorus
# We've met along the way....
# We've met along the way

# Only you have the answers
# But the questions you have to find
# Only you know the secrets
# But the truth lies deep in your mind
# Only you are the answer
# You turn the night into day - yeah
# Only you are the manchild
# You are the light and you are the way
# Tell me the secrets
# I wanna know
# Tell me the secrets
# I wanna know
# Only you
# Only you are the manchild
# You are the light and you are the way
# I can't believe this is is true
# Why do I listen to you
# If I am all that you say
# Why am I still so afraid
# Only you...
# In every age
# In every time
# A hero is born
# As if by a grand design

# Wiped Out!
# I went to a party, just so smartly, cool as cool could be
# I knew I could make it, knew I could shake it
# Lose some fancy free
# So I went to the table and reached for a bottle
# And poured me a glass of wine
# Took a few sips and looked around, I was feelin' fine
# But an hour along, comin' on strong, I was gettin' drunk
# The next thing I knew I looked at you
# I was blind as a skunk, I was
# I was wiped out, I had my lights out
# Was fallin' right out, 'cos I was wiped out
# Through the smoke-filled room I caught your eye
# And I think that you caught mine
# And I knew in a minute or maybe less
# It was just a matter of time
# Then you started to move with such a groove
# Stronger than sneakin' slow
# Then you looked at me with your big blue eyes
# They had such a glow
# Then I took your hand and tried to stand
# And ended up sittin' back down
# Then you smiled at me and gave me a wink
# How quick I lost my frown, I was
# I was wiped out, I had my lights out
# Was fallin' right out, 'cos I was wiped out
# So I looked at you and then I knew

# Yo, grabbin' my Charlie Bronson, manifestin' ya death wish
# Now in these days of Daggo my mind stays raggo
# Rugged like Brilo, these eyes bleed weeping willow

# Communicate one to one via my afro

# I'm stressed out, blowin' sess out my nostril
# Apostles warnin' of storms on the coastal
# Contact the locals, we symbolise now with subliminal loco's
# It goes deeper than big bangs and black holes
# On roads, I stop to admire a black rose
# She's so beautiful, I chose not to pick it
# While other wicked man would have dig it
# Now triple nine is the reflection of the ripplin' time
# While cripple minds run blind into the eye of the storm
# I've fought wars and returned war torn
# My wife was scorned, she took the life of my first born
# So be warned, these days of times are now transformed
# A pen is a now formed of states and collateral
# As clapped opium petrels, a rose sent to capture you
# From Clapton to Katmandu, what can a man do?
# It said man handle my inner feeling, sealing the inner angles
# Maintain my balance while walkin' on broken ankles
# My moods manifest into red shades of scandals
# Home of website of the seed we weave
# My chest heave, I breathe to ventilate this grief
# I'm seekin' relief in a brief glimpse of Parrowdice
# Beget left paralyzed from the Jankrows and parasites
# My eyesight, from great heights of hindsight
# I'm tryin' to line the blind mind with divine light
# But find my life to be a start to the death
# So fuck vex, my mind state is Semtex
# Explosive guides of venomous viper
# Stalk the beats like a wild tiger

I got married and I got a son, -Who's your daddy? and the team plays like one big family. But despite all that I miss the guys from the national team, in Phoenix my Maja sometimes makes me žganci, because I love everything, everything that is Slovene, especially the fans, who cheer like hell. Now in NBA they call me the Dragon - Zmaj, when it awakes inside me, beware of the fire, hit it now!  Goran, our Goran, you, you, you are our best basketball player in the world, faster than a bird, raining three-pointers. I love you and give you everything I've got, You truly are a heck of a guy, a perfect man to marry. Even Kevin Durant knows you're an All-Star.

# vodljiv po stranpoteh norosti
# in v izobilju prostih dni
# tožeč po uricah mladosti.
# Samo človek sem, saj veš,
# včasih samopašnež,
# včasih grešnik in hudič,
# a včasih bog, ki vse odpušča ...
# Samo človek,
# frčeč za trpolečo srečo,
# v besu dneva zmedeno ihtečo
# po dokončnem domu, ki ga ni.
# Samo človek sem, razumeš?
# Potreben nekoga,
# ki je mene potreben.
# Pa hkrati sem prvinski čudež,
# tako kot roža in plevel,
# kot veter, prst in močerad,
# kot solza in pomlad
# in kot nasmeh in iskrica v očesu,
# ko se zaveš,
# da nekdo ima te rad.
# In kot vse.
# Pa saj ti veš ...
> Klemen Teran
# Kot da bi prvič sploh prižgal luči,
# ugledal dušo, ki molče trpi,
# jo z rosnimi očmi
# rotil naj se bori,
# da s skupnimi močmi
# zdrživa, kar boli.
# A v njenih prsih že je bival hlad,
# še bolj zmrzav od tistega takrat,
# ko sem sejal laži
# kako je zame ni,
# če enega teh dni
# ne sname mi vrvi.
# Sebična misel ta mi pala le
# v puščobno glavo in odšla, kot vse.
# S tresočimi zobmi
# med njenimi lasmi
# sem sam prevzel njen hlad,
# ko sem jo snel z vrvi.
# Sem sploh res kdaj bil tam za njo?
# Ali le ljubil sem telo?
# Mar res tak prasec puhoglav
# le za ponos sem jo jemal?
# Poslušal skup njenih besed -
# preslišal mar sem v njih poved?
# Zavajal me njen glasen smeh?
# Da lažen bil je, ni njen greh.
# Več nisem jokal nikdar od takrat,
# le kdaj, ko čujem da kak deklič mlad
# obesil se za vrat
# pomislim "Ta prevrat
# nek fant preprečil bi,
# če res jo imel bi rad."
# Sploh vem kako je imeti rad,
# ali le tripam na pomlad?
# Mar res tak prasec puhoglav
# za svoj ponos sem le jemal?
# Mi sodbo naj kroji cel svet,
# če kriv sem ... Kar naj bom preklet,
# če res tak prasec puhoglav,
# za svoj prestiž sem ji dajal.

# [Verse 1]
# Once upon a time in the projects, yo
# There lived a nigga named Knoc-Turn'al
# America's most wanted, for sho'
# In a black Lo-Lo, with tinted windows
# Just cruisin' down the street in my 6-4
# Checking all my traps and all my hoes
# Life is, too short, I stay on my toes
# G'd up, I spill gin and juice on brand new clothes
# I pulled up, hit a switch and dropped the back
# On the prowl in a black hat lookin for cats
# I got a chrome plaque that reads, "Who's the Mac?!"
# Black pussy, always talk about it 'cause I love it
# This California love got a nigga drunk in public
# Express yo' self, keep doin' it good
# Got white on the block, keep the heat in the bush
# Keep risin' to the top, keep smokin' the kush
# The boys in the hood are always hard
# Come talkin that trash, we'll pull your guard
# Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
# Can't trust my homies, can't trust no bitch
# Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't say shit
# It's hotter on the block than it is in the kitchen
# And I'm hard in the paint, listen, I'm steady dippin
# I get down, while your bullshittin'
# And these are the tales, the freaky tales
# Of a nigga on the grind that you know so well
# Got a system in your trunk then I'm jacking for beats
# Black superman, I put it down for L.A.C
# I grip the pump in my lap at all times
# Fools be jackin' other fools but they don't be jackin mine
# Summer time in the L.B.C. (Fuck the police)
# Fuck being bound by law and the peace treaty
# We be clubbin, everybody likes when the girls shake somethin
# System overload, stay bumpin
# It's thug life, y'all know the rules, gotta do what ya gotta do, and stay true
# Propose a toast to the West Coast
# Easily I approach the microphone because I ain't no joke
# Tell your mama to get off of my dip
# I have no time to give her my dick, I'm gonna hold it
# And walk around the stage
# And if you fuck up, I'm gonna get my gauge and shrivel you up
# Like California raisins, then unload the barrell and laugh
# 'Cause I'm puttin lead in your motherfuckin' ass
# [Verse 2]
# I'm on the radio, and ain't a damn thing funny
# It's just like Compton, bitch better have my money
# I messed up and I don't know why
# Tryin' to get a piece of that American Pie
# Do my thing, blow off the roof on 187-Proof
# It's gettin funk-ay, it's gettin funk-ay
# It's the formula, murder was the case that they gave me
# Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
# Dear Mama, Brenda had a baby
# Hard times got a nigga goin' crazy
# The hood can't take me under, it's a G-thang
# We backyard bullyin' in the land where we bang
# Gangsta's make the world go 'round
# What's my motherfuckin' name?
# Knoc-Turn'al, didn't even have to use my AK
# Today was a good day

# I'm a do me (yes)
# You gon' do you

# I'm a do me
# I'm a do me
# [Verse 1: Knoc-Turn'al]
# I'm the most underrated rapper of all time
# So why do you accept those that bite my rhymes?
# Me and Eminem ride for D-R-E (Dr. Dre)
# Me and X (Xzibit) was in the club bout to blast off heat
# Quik (DJ) told me to be all I can be
# Nate (Dogg) is my "Dogg" him and Warren G
# They recognize the Ridah in the driver's seat
# An even 50 Cent said he'll ride for me (ah, get em)
# We somethin' like Gangsta Rap cousins
# On my daughter I'm a die for I let you touch em
# You know I like livin'
# Enjoyin' myself and I ain't bullshittin'
# You don't move me wit fat mouth and lippin'
# And you don't want to see me out of retirement trippin'
# I got a lot to live for
# And I'd be damned if I change one bit
# I like the way I am
# You understand?
# [Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al]
# Put your hands up, come off them grams
# I ain't trippin' that's the way I am (the way I am)
# And if you see me wit heat in my hand
# You better duck, that's the way I am (the way I am)
# I can't believe you got up in them pants
# Sexy lady, go on, do that dance
# Come on over when you sick of ya man
# And we can chill, that's the way I am (the way I am)
# [Hook: Knoc-Turn'al]
# I don't know that girl, I just met her
# Sippin' on sour Amoretta
# She gon' do her thing if I let her (yes!)
# But I'm a bounce cause her friend looks better
# I like the way she notice me
# I like the way she got herself in V.I.P
# If she sees K-N-O-C
# She gon' chill and wait out front for me
# [Verse 2: Knoc-Turn'al]
# Who do you know that rides for the Coast
# With a new breed and style of Rap like me?
# I had the patience to study the game
# Dr. Dre made two Chronics and this is Chronic III
# I make classic hits and buy classic cars
# And see classic hoes at classic bars
# Knoc just stepped in the spot and the "girls all pause"
# Magic stick , I break down walls
# Got my heat if some shit jumps off
# Really, you steppin' to me is a lost cause
# Party animal, here since a 1/4 to 10:00
# Baby face, 6'2" wit a L.A. brim
# I got Shell-Toes on - I don't wear them Timbs
# Got hoes, got weed, and a gallon of Gin
# Ain't no tellin' what I might get in
# The first night, do it right, I'm a do it again
# Come on
# [Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al]

# You know where we be, in the club

# Kobe, how many girls ahve said, "I love you?"
# Not like 'I love you Kobe!' like a fan
# But like, for real, like, baby, marry me
# I love you
# You're sweet
# Once again (Once again)
# Flawless (Flawless)
# C'mon
# Right
# Uh, uh huh
# Yo, yo, it's like this
# Uh, what I live for? Basketball, beats and broads
# From Italy to the US, yes, it's raw
# I'ma search for the one that make my wealth feel poor
# Who can ignore the spotlight life of Grandma
# My falldown is how I found the aura, so I searched in
# There's plenty of women with sex appeal when it's filled
# Can even complete the package, all I date is actresses
# Can play it safe with them, my money ain't bait
# But I must take risks to find a honey that's legit
# Whether she push a buck and a six, bumpin' some mad chips
# Out on her own, or live out of moms and pop's home
# Watch time, fashion, Adidas attire or Timbo's
# I don't know, yo, these women come and go
# Like the wind they blow, how do I know it's you for sure?
# When God talk to me, give me a signal
# But until then, all my ears hear, just let me flow
# C'mon

# K-O-B-E, I L-O-V-E you
# I believe you are very fine
# If you give me one chance, I promise to love you
# And be with you forever more
# Check this out though
# Real love last, now do you love me or my cash?
# My name, fame, drop top, Benz or the wooden dash?
# You know my stash, from Georgie cash
# Platinum, US express, no paper cash
# Spend it all now, or kiss to be rich cash
# Hash, stocks and bonds, laugh when they crash
# Are you the type that brag the jewels you flash
# The type-type with your ex-man and push his Jag
# The type that love no scrubs or pigeons and got mad
# The type that can't stand a women with her own cash
# You know, like lime, claim she ain't rat
# The type that get loud in public, refrain my hand from a slap
# No time for y'all, too busy for y'all
# Plenty of dimes turn me on and turn me off tryin' to show off
# Get lost, grow up, real women, roll up
# Let yourself go, if you feel this, let me know
# C'mon

# K-O-B-E, I L-O-V-E you     Bounce wit' me, bounce wit' me
# K-O-B-E, I L-O-V-E you     Right, right, uh, uh, uh
# Think ya eyein' me, all along, I'm eyein' you
# The hunter becomes the hunted, girl, I'm preying on you
# Beautiful, the feelings we share are mutual
# Passion that's telling me so for us is suitable
# Un-controllable desire flows through me
# When you say my name, such lust in your slang
# No time for games, the games I play, all the same
# Can't get witcha, when the door hitcha, when the Lord splitcha
# I figure, hour-glass figures could be dangerous
# Cuz if your time runs out, they frame you for your clout
# And having a past, well, I stereotype glass
# All dimes ain't money, ass, and feignin' for a brother's cash
# Slash fame, slash power, slash respect
# All the above, makes me a supreme threat to scrubs
# Love but do you want? One more 'gain, let me know
# The words flow, from the bottom of your soul

# Ker z nekim sranjem zaigrajo.

# Zarad užitka, al zarad jeze, al zarad frajarije,

# Alone on a bar-room table, she was watching me watching her
# I was singing about an old flame burning
# She was hanging on to every line
# I was pouring out my feelings, she was pouring out the wine
# Through the smoke and the beer, it was perfectly clear
# That we were touching each other's minds
# It was love ten feet away
# Imagine her in my arms, with that look on her face
# Lying somewhere in some shadowy place
# It was love, just ten feet away
# I just knew my closing song would do it
# I knew that I was heaven bound
# I could tell she was new, but before I was through
# A stranger walked up and sat down
# He was trying his best to impress her
# But she never took her eyes off me
# When he got up and left, I said to myself
# "Oh no! What a night this would be."
# It was love ten feet away
# Imagine her in my arms, with that look on her face
# Lying somewhere in some shadowy place
# It was love, just ten feet away
# It was love ten feet away
# Imagine her in my arms, with that look on her face
# Lying somewhere in some shadowy place
# It was love, just ten feet away
# It was love, just tenfeet away

# Lookin out the tight skirts rollin up the turnpike
# Rollin down the highway - tanks, food, gas
# Look in your rearview, kid I'm up on yo' ass

# Diesel trucks with big engines, Caterpillar motors
# Y'all move over, we honkin the horns behind your Escalade
# Bam-bam-bam-bammm!  That's us
# With one overload, behind your Range Rover, truck stops
# Last night we made the drops, air pressure on the brakes
# Fssssssssshew, one tank better than Jake
# Y'all talk a lot of mouth, while we pulled up at the waffle house
# Interstate we movin forward, 18 gears the bridge ain't closed
# 4008 Peterbilt, orange and gray long-nose, haulin apples grade A
# Swap trailers on payday
# Your meat get delivered on tough beats
# While y'all supposed to be movin on tough streets
# Play it back baby, crank the pipes, I don't think they got heat
# (Breaker 1-9, this is Fat Mic)
# [Chorus: Kool Keith]
# Diesel truckin baby - poppin No-Doz for nights
# Lookin out the tight skirts rollin up the turnpike
# Rollin down the highway - I'm overweight, runnin late
# Didn't stop at the scale, highway patrol on my tail
# Diesel truckin baby - poppin No-Doz for nights
# Lookin out the tight skirts rollin up the turnpike
# Rollin down the highway - tanks, food, gas
# Look in your rearview, kid I'm up on yo' ass
# [MC Dopestyle - *best guess*]
# Diesel monster truck rollin, huh, burgundy
# Surly more deadly and ready for roadkill melee
# I shear, runnin over deers and queers
# Niggaz, way back, suck cheers and beer, last chance for fear
# Hey - HELLLLOHH, little kiddie
# Pink bows in your hair and ahh, you're lookin - pretty
# What I really look like, I leave no one else
# No mercy a killer, kiss my pinkie ring, come kiss it
# Sit in fun seats, shiny skirts, big dice on the dash
# Flamin all lost with David Lynch, highbeams flash
# The cash in ya brastrap, is how much I spent on hubcaps
# Blew my 8, cylinder, right before, I split ya
# Put a nice suck me suck me cut me orgasm champagne
# Vibe bully pistol me kink throw me slit my throat shut me out
# It was out in my diesel truck, that I call Lil' Sally
# [Kool Keith]
# Man you're ready for Kansas, up here I'm rollin
# 21 gears behind a lady drivin a Volkswagen, I can't stand this
# Box weight, ox weight
# I gotta be in Grand Rapids at a quarter to 8, not a quarter too late
# When I hit the clutch, everything shake
# I don't know what route I'ma take
# Hit Flying J's in the Great Lakes
# Engine red hot, his coffee pot, two barrels of fuel on each side
# I laugh at the gas exit when you've gotta stop
# Respect all the way up to the radars, check my rearview
# Wave at weigh stations, it's all love for you
# With sheriffs and cops, Detroit diesel engine you can't stop
# When the reindeer lock, everything stay 100 speed limit
# Watch the grill block

# Wanted to holla and tell ya what's poppin but you probly
# Already know we been goin' through problems, anyway I

# I hear you been searchin for God inside The Koran
# That's cool man, I been prayed up myself
# I pray for my health and stress way less for wealth now
# I'm still a soldier but I'm tryin to be one for Jehovah
# We in the Last Days and tha Last Days is almost over
# We all older now, my minds much stronger now
# I can see in ya letters ya vocabulary's broader now
# I wish we woulda been this smart before we let this game rip us apart
# But we forgot that God was our heart, heart
# But dont even sweat it my nigga stay strong
# And we gon kick it when u come home, my nigga Flesh n Bone, Flesh n Bone

# What up Lay? Hope you and ya family okay
# I don't even know where I should begin 'cuase I got so many things to say
# We been dawgs since the Seventh Grade, the Seventh Grade
# Struggled together for a better way, and better days
# We was Kid n Play, Kriss Kross and all them niggaz
# They called you the light one and of course I was the dark skinned one
# Hey! You was the human beat box and I was the rapper
# In the battles in between classes, those days
# They ain't the same no more, we don't even hang no more
# We let the fame destroy something's that's worth way more
# 'Cuase friends are kinda hard to come by ain't no tellin these days
# We should of seen it comin' ain't no trustin these snakes
# But all in all, we had a ball
# And even though we took a fall, it's not for long fa sho!
# We'd be some damn fools if we let silly ego's
# Come between some damn trues and cause a fam fued
# Wish, my nigga, I can clearly remember
# See me and you go way back to that day and night in November
# Or was it December? When you was mobbin tryin to rob some niggaz
# And I was out, put the slug in the pump and I cocked it nigga
# But I had my finger still on the trigger, Oh my God, my nigga
# Screamin at me like "You shot me nigga!" and I was shocked my nigga
# My ears started ringin, I was tweakin, blood was squirtin
# You was swervin on the curb man, word man
# Rushed to Emergency, coppers came and arrested me
# Even though you told them I didn't do it they cuffin me
# We told them we was just chillin and niggaz hit us
# Half dead and ain't snitchin now that's the realest, that was the realest
# That's why we still down, what's really real now
# Make ya feel how, we in it to win it with a ill style
# You suckas better recognize, better check it
# When Krayzie and Wish head over ThugLine Records nigga
# [Verse 4]
# I ain't forgot ya Bizzy Bone, what's happenin?
# We was always in some action every night straight to ?brackin? its crackin
# We walked the streets together, starvin, ain't eat together
# Slept outside in zero below, it's gon freeze together
# I remember I went to the county
# And when I got out you went to bustin your pistol, nigga you rowdy
# Now how'd all of a sudden it gettin so cloudy, so cloudy
# They say Krayzie got problems with Bizzy, that's why they, they breakin up
# Only problem I had was you runnin out on the band
# But you explained to me deeper and now I understand
# So why is niggaz beefin when there's cheese to get and bread to stack
# And head's to crack, we got a deadly rap
# Nigga together we the coldest, coldest
# The realest East 99 soldiers, soldiers
# United we ball, divided we fall
# When Bone come back we silence 'em all

# I look at my life and I realize I don't wanna let go
# No, I'm tryin' to survive I don't wanna die I'm searchin' the best road
# Never playin' myself, I'm playin' with death
# Nigga y'all better wake up to livin' and appreciate the life ya givin'
# Oh no I don't, wanna go, not now man
# There's too many things a nigga got planned so much to understand
# Still so many goals for me to acheive in, please believe in
# It's rough but still that ain't a reason, to stop ya breathin'
# They ask if a nigga was scared to pass away
# And I'm tellin' 'em, "Hell yeah, I can't hug my babies if I drift and slept in Hades"
# It's crazy how niggaz be killin' be sayin' they ready to die
# You ready to die? I'm ready to live nigga, grow up wit my kids nigga
# Ain't takin' no chances on no after life
# Because there's only death after life
# So I be spending my time, tryin' to stay alive
# If I gotta live and let die
# [Verse 2]
# Now that we livin' in a world full of war and murder
# But money makes the world go round and round
# Everybody killin' everybody what's that sound?
# How many make the heat that buck come buck 'em on down
# May we all rest in peace
# Looks like we gon' all rest in peace
# The world R.I.P
# [Verse 3]
# Now everybody wanna go to heaven, but nobody wanna die
# And that don't make sense
# But let me tell ya that I know of a place where, we can go and just chill (for real)
# No more crime, no more strain
# No more die, no more pain
# No more wasting our lives away
# Got to pray, got to pray, got to pray, got to pray
# Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
# And if ya fall, be sure to ride and everything's gonna be alright
# Just keep ya eyes on ya prize
# And maybe you'll make it up out of this life
# We all die so young, victims of the gun
# A poverty to harmony and then it marks us
# My nigga you ready to end it, potnah speak for yourself
# I'm down with life, and everything else to hell with death
# [Chorus 2X]

# If motherfuckers wanna see me, nigga put some glasses on
# Because I'm right up in your fuckin' face, it's to late
# To try to run and try to get away, don't try clearin' your vision
# Cause that's straight, you in the presence of Leatha Face
# Just an average motherfuckin' thug, have to spit it for the fun
# Bad nigga with a gun, uh-huh so run, run, run
# But he's testin' many slugs
# Come in, you'll be done, done, before we even get started
# Lovin' the war cause that's the art of it, and we'll bomb your shit
# Before you even realize we the niggaz got a problem with ya
# Mista sawed off, nigga bow down, now kiss this, click, click
# What's up, what you niggaz really wanna do, get the fuck up
# Mothafucker should a never put my name in they mouth
# But I'm a get it out when I buck, buck, and you explode
# Ya head, ya neck, conection no more, corpse hit the floor
# Nigga never realize until they've been choked
# Cause they've been told, time after time and it's still reckon
# Like they don't know, so play me though, don't be blowed away
# And stored away, in a box up under that dirt nails in the coffin
# Just do this a, watch how we play, down with the dirty
# Everytime we do it, I'm the nigga rollin' with the gold tec 'n
# To use it, so be choosy and don't be stupid, don't walk in to it
# When you see the Line rollin' by y'all better move it
# Now I said excuse me, the money bust a u-turn, they come back
# With the oozy, turn this thing into a movie
# And you the first nigga dead 'fore the creits even roll up
# I play the killa in the picture, and you know I'm gon' get ya
# Cause it's my script, duh, movie produced by me
# The original t-h-u-g, when you look in the dictionary
# For the meaning of thug, motherfucker should see me
# Now nigga did you see me, did you see me, did you see me
# Nigga do you feel it, did you feel it, did I rap now a I see
# Better nigga dog, Ken Dawg, kill a dog, now nigga let me hit it
# I bust it and I fuck a nigga right up with a pistol (??)
# Now you caught up in the middle of the crossfire
# And now your lifes in danger, gonna wrap his neck with some

# Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
# Turning on the world the way she smiles upon my soul as i lay diing
# Healing with the colors of the sunshine and the shadow of her eyes
# Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
# Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that i've been
# Teaching me that yesterday was something that i never thought of trying
# Talking about tomorrow and the money love and time we'd have to spend
# Loving her was easier than anything i'll ever do again
# Coming close together with a feeling that i've never know before,in my time
# She ain't afraid to be a woman or afraid to be a friend

# Well I woke up Sunday morning
# with no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt

# wasn't bad so I had one more for dessert
# then I fumbled through my closet for my clothes
# and found my cleanest dirty shirt
# it's the one I'm wearin'
# and I shaved my face and combed my hair
# and stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
# I'd smoked my brain the night before
# or:I smoked so much the night before
# with cigarettes and songs that I've been pickin'
# my mouth was like an ashtray I'd been lickin'
# but I lit my first and watched a small kid
# cussin' at a can that he was kicking
# then I crossed the empty street
# and caught the Sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken
# and it took me back to somethin'
# that I'd lost somehow somewhere along the way
# On the Sunday morning sidewalks
# wishing Lord that I was stoned
# 'cause there is something in a Sunday
# that makes a body feel alone
# and there's nothin' short of dyin'
# half as lonesome as the sound
# on the sleepin' city side walks
# Sunday mornin' comin' down
# In the park I saw a daddy
# with a laughing little girl who he was swingin'
# and I stopped beside a Sunday school
# and listened to the song that they were singin'
# then I headed back for home and
# somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
# and it echoed thru the canyon like
# the disappearing dreams of yesterday.

# kakor igrača sem bila tvoja draga
# ne bom čakala, da se me naveličaš,
# zato dvigam vse, obračam novo stran
# Refren:
# hej, hej, nisem tvoja lutka, marioneta brez moči
# hej, hej, nisem tvoja lutka, imuna sem na vse
# hej, hej, nisem tvoja lutka, marioneta brez moči
# naivna mala ki se je vdala, lutke te več ni
# bilo je morje, bilo je  krivo to morje,

# vse si obljabljal, jaz sem slepo verjela
# prevarana se dvigam, obračam novo stran

# Sad stvarno mislim da smo otišli daleko
# I prosto ne znam kako vratićemo leto kući
# Jer kada je kasno
# Za neke stvari prosto nisi tako krojen
# I sama kriva sam što život mi je bojen sivom
# Umesto zlatnom
# Potpuno sama kriva sam
# U život sam te uvukla
# Nikoga nisam pitala
# I tako mi treba
# I kako ću sada
# Ja nisam tako mlada
# Kako ispočetka
# Da nađem svoj put
# O čemu ću da sanjam
# I kome da se vraćam
# Da li znas da
# Bez tvog osmeha i život je ljut
# Sve naše godine sad ništa nam ne vrede
# Oduvek mislila sam, čekaćemo sede nekad
# Zajedno negde
# Možda u kućici na moru koju sanjaš
# Al’ u životu svaki san moraš da ganjaš dugo
# I sa mnogo snage
# A to je to što fali ti
# Da mene malo nosiš ti
# Sad će se čaša preliti
# I tako mi treba
# I kako ću sada
# Ja nisam tako mlada
# Kako ispočetka
# Da nađem svoj put
# O čemu ću da sanjam
# I kome da se vraćam

# Bez tvog osmeha i život je ljut

# You know it's Kris!
# It ain't the same now  (it ain't the same)
# They switched the game now  (they switched up on us)
# They talk 'bout chains now  (bling bling)
# Rims on the Range now
# It's sounding plain now
# Y'all rock the same style  (sound of the mic)
# I know the way how  (I know)
# Bring it back to one
# It's supposed to be...
# This is the way it's supposed to be
# It's supposed to be like you more close to me
# It's supposed to be about our families
# It's supposed to be about avoiding catastrophe
# But it's all about salary and flattery
# Distrust, lust, hate and tragedy
# It's supposed to be about you and me on the same route
# Were you there in eighty-six when I first came out?
# And you know about how they runnin' this game out
# It's supposed to be about fun and getting' the pain out
# But it's all about clout and poppin' them chains out
# Instead of forgiveness, we poppin' they brains out
# It's supposed to be about seekin' in the seek out
# You witnessin' injustice, you got to speak out
# If you claimin' you love this, you got to release doubt
# Knowledge is what I'm all about
# Well it's supposed to be sunlight over me
# Light over you, not you runnin' over me
# It's supposed to be a two dollar royalty minimum
# A Hiphop guildâ€”we got to begin buildin' 'em
# It's supposed to be NO police brutality
# And the fact that we tolerate that crap is insanity
# It's supposed to be museums and archives
# Where people can see the importance of OUR lives
# But it ain't about any of this
# Cats are trying to get that diamond-studded Rolex on they wrist
# You hear a voice in the wildernessâ€”you know it's Kris
# Higher consciousness lyrics, they will persist
# But it's supposed to be about makin' it better
# You see, Hiphop's not a product like pants or sweater
# Go aheadâ€”be a hero, get your cheddar
# Even y'all gonna see when you look back you remember that
# You can see in your heart how it's supposed to be
# You doin' your part, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
# Pursuin' your art, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
# Today you will start, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
# It shouldn't be about you movin' slowly
# Then talkin' junk when you don't even know me
# And you cats be pussy like Josie
# I +Touch+ "50 MC's" like +Tony+
# Everybody in the hood ain't your homie
# I spit the truth, but I'm not the only

# Hot tracks y'all prep for combat

# Knowledge Reigns Supreme, believe and live
# You done heard the hype, COME to where the talent is
# "I'm Still #1," yup you heard right
# People say, "KRS-One you shine bright!"
# Others say, "Yo - you rhyme tight"
# When you find me, you find light, and that's alright
# I don't know about pimpin, sellin women like retail
# Or turning coke into crack for resale
# But I do know if we fail
# In 2020 our children by the million gonna be jailed
# We got the victory over the streets
# God willin we chillin, we know we gon' eat
# I'm a whole different kind of MC, hoes don't like
# not tempt me but the ladies treat me oh so gently
# Universities sendin me stretch Bentleys
# My seminars and lectures, are rarely never empty
# We teach students plenty, honorary degrees
# Gold and platinum plaques I got many, ask Kenny
# People get shocked when I walk into Denny's
# Or the corner Kwik-Stop, they say, "That's Hip-Hop
# right there," and yeah it's really quite clear
# 2004 might be the right year
# for mental and spiritual repair
# The solution is in the resolution you just declared
# When I speak like this
# Knowledge Reigns Supreme, hip-hop philosopher
# All in the street well I'm very popular
# All through the hood I make all the stops and I
# avoid the cops and them random shots well I
# love hip-hop and I, live hip-hop so I
# spit that shit to get you off your block cause I
# can't understand and I, wish I could see dem
# cats that talk bout they love the hood and they
# never bring the hood anything that's good, and they
# rap for the money tree, chasin a company
# But I think you can now see, rap is fun to me
# I got a ministry, a class, a staff that's under me
# KRS in pop rap?  Nah, it ain't ought to be
# It'll never happen like, you eatin pork with me
# Amateurs hawkin me, DON'T EVEN talk to me
# My house is in Atlanta but I still got New York in me
# Walk with me, most rappers are short to me
# I'm like Chamberlain, dominatin the sport you see
# I toss MC's off of me
# When you hear KRS you say that's how it ought to be
# I drop heat like this!

# [Chorus: sample from a live performance of "The Bridge is Over"]
# Here's another example of the KRS-One (BO!)
# Here's another example of the KRS-One (BO!)
# They wish to battle BDP but they cannot
# They must be on the jock of WHO?  (DJ Scott LaRock!)
# Yeah, one-two, what?  What?
# Grab any tape that you think is hard
# Put it in your tape deck and press record
# Get this - what's a real hip-hop emcee?
# Is it MTV?  Is it BET?
# Is it five M-I-C's so the people can see?
# I mean, how you think you free when you act like property?
# Tell me, how can you judge an MC when he's rockin
# I mean, rockin it live, not pickin his cotton
# I mean, adjustin his clothes I mean, how do you know
# before you come to the show, and you're not gettin cheated
# That you're not gettin heated, that you ain't come to the club
# thinkin, "Uh-uh - I must have been weeded!"
# You got to be a educated consumer
# Spend your money on MC's cause these rappers'll do ya
# All they want is your cash, ass, glass, gas and a flick
# When you ask for that autograph, they ass dash quick
# Beware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter
# He pulls his gat while we BUST OFF the gatler
# He's more of an actor, someone, into theater
# Not an upright MC with styles who speaks clearer!
# MC's have no time for the bar
# Unless we politickin a tape to some drunk A&R
# We grab the mic and say who we are, KRS
# And start takin it to the chest of the best
# This is not a test or a demo
# This is when you let go of the limo, like many can't do
# They may wanna amp you and chant new, record sellin
# But movin the crowd is somethin that they can't do!
# C'mon!
# You got to be mistaken, I am not your boy
# You fake what you creatin, playin wit'cha toys
# G'wan with all that bullshit bout you bringin noise
# Time for somethin more than PO-PO-POI-POI
# All of hip-hop ain't seventeen
# Some of us still go back to "Microphone Fiend"
# Back when it was just MC's and DJ's
# No video that come on and just replay
# Uhhh... uh-huh, uh-huh uh-huh
# We can never stop, forever we rock, take a listen
# The t'cha is back, cause rap's whack when I'm missin
# Me, I would never want the future to believe
# that when they trust to look back on us there was no dope MC's
# There was, all these rappers grabbin more and more money
# And now that I'm A&R they look more and more funny
# They rap for platinum plaques without buildin
# a cultural strategy worthy of our children!

# How many MC's must get dissed
# How many young men must get frisked
# How much ice can really go on one wrist
# How many shots get fired at a target and just miss
# We gonna live like this?
# I walk the same path that Ma$e do

# Back when we was all singin "Monie in the Middle"

# Even when outside was brittle, you still had on little
# And KRS warned that you'll get played like a fiddle
# Now you havin cravings for pickles cause you pregnant
# and don't know where the dad went and you poppin them drugs like Skittles
# When the baby is born it's little and sick

# When advice is in your life you need to take it
# Cause frankly, everybody ain't gonna make it
# Back in the days we, showed 'em the way
# I put it there in the music but you weren't amazed
# You would criticize, debate, and basically hate
# But let it be known I wanted everyone to be great
# But you would diss and not even try to do better
# When we was at the U.N. you said "whatever"
# NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. word
# NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. we movin ahead, you still in the same spot
# NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. 'member all that back talk, all that?

# [Kurupt & Trigga]
# Yeah, yeh what the deal dog
# (Where you from?)
# BK, NYC, reppin' wid the DPG
# Yeah what the dealy
# Yo, yo, yo, yo, LAFC
# Everything else cool, the Wu-Tang is the best
# Dogg Pound's the best
# [Verse 1: Trigga]
# Mic accurate, trade darts TL
# Slight tint DL, quick flash
# Smooth as a baby's ass,
# Lyrical addicts, murder mics like a savage
# And MO30, bullet proof tuxedos
# Transactions, C-notes for the kilos
# 'Bout our money, killa bees love the honey
# Puttin' a sting, on warriors in the ring
# Get mashed out initiation face slashed out
# Block dropper, drama action like I won an Oscar
# Eye on me, feds spy on me
# It's them cops in the choppers that play the roof
# Ready to snipe, stay bulletproof
# Ease up on the over proof
# Level head the liable and leave ya for dead
# Fill fulla lead
# Incidents, classified accidents
# No evidence, po-po innocent crime pays
# I guess it's the American ways
# Far from slaves,
# Yet behind bars and cage
# Fair exchange clicked ya bow wid ya 12-guage
# [Verse 2: Baby S]
# It's time for me to do this sh** for all my years hurtin'
# See these other niggas bustin' raps that ain't workin'
# I'm jerkin' the game, heavyweight pocket exchange
# Touch my niggas that's broke and hope them niggas do the same
# Pause, squeeze ya balls wid no draws
# Down for the cause and hoes takin' off they draws
# Y'all, niggas, ain't knowin' the half
# Everywhere I go feel like I'm runnin' from crash
# My intention to smash fast plex on elevators
# Sacked a hell a haters crime raider on the fader
# I'm major now, women hit me on my pager
# While I'm puffin' on the bombay,
# The vietnam way... pimpin' in a calm way
# And rule one, never let a bi*** know where your baby mom's stay
# Now if you see me creepin' thorugh SC
# Just walk on by, nigga, just walk on by
# Before you f*** up my high
# Before you f*** up my high
# Before you f*** up my high
# If you see me in the NYC
# Just walk on by, nigga, just walk on by
# Before you f*** up my high
# Before you f*** up my high
# Before you f*** up my high
# [Verse 3: Short Khop]
# Got the session on lockdown
# Make way for the c***ed pound
# Best to give it all you got now fool
# For this new era, new order, new terror, new torture
# Run up and extort ya
# Abort ya missions,
# Escort physicians to the spot you and I met rep for combat
# Where the bomb at, chop up on that
# Niggas I been there and done that
# Catch a contact
# By drainin', try trainin'
# Holla when you've perfected ya aimin'
# Ready for a taming
# And catch me at the spot wid this clown gashed up
# Ya found me in his wife face down mashed up
# No stoppin' this, I'm most poppinest
# Anything to the left of monotonous
# Mister Khopadopalous,
# Blockin' this hold ya down tech potent
# Any nigga second guessin' keep his face opened
# [Verse 4: Kurupt]
# Check it out, got games, crackle
# Clash of the titans up against the crackin'
# Come to f*** you up, stuck you up
# Niggas bust, niggas lookin' like Kurupt
# What the f*** you want?
# All at you motherf***ing small fry small guy
# Motherf***in' small cat, beat wid pipes poles and bats
# Blast wid a small gat
# Run, and bust till his lungs collapse
# And hit the corner pocket
# But first strip his pockets
# He shouldn'ta got caught in the mixture
# See I'm the type of nigga to pull out the paintbrush
# And the board and the paper and paint a picture
# You shootin' and got shot
# We shoot ya, Drex Luthor
# ?Then pull pens to report to zoopers?
# I'm a 6-4 rap, 44 mag calicos and mass,
# Double bags caught cash
# Wid cash on cash dub sacks new blocks
# Baby S, El Drex, Kurupt, Trigga and Short Khop
# When you see me wid the DPG

# [Verse 5: El-Drex]
# Yo, yo, verbal seizures
# Coming from the black Johnny Fever
# You bought your heater turn like Tina when Ike beat her
# We kidnapped ya girl and ain't feed her she's a heavy bleeder,
# At this point you realise that you ain't really need her
# Cats that get it betta stand on they pivot
# Life is rigid from the business and pleasure, when you miss it
# Oh well forget it wipe my pinkie ring when you kissed it
# Couldn't keep ya distance, so things was done deliberate
# A G-thing, this cost cash is not a free thing
# When we sing that's when they bring the jealousy thing
# But that alerts me, the low and dirty wanna hurt me
# They equal to the numbers on Robert Paris jersey
# Blood thirsty ten O.Gs in black derbys
# We throw things, I got a arm like Testa Verdy
# It's Drex Andretti the live lyrical compulsive
# Betta contact ya physician for over dosage
# You lost ya focus, realise what you get
# A little bit of good sh**
# And alot of bullsh**,
# Now you wounded,
# So you got exactly what you earned
# You gon' fool wid the Drex it's like a tax return
# When I'm in the 2-F-I-V-E
# Just walk on by, just walk on by
# Before you f*** up my high
# Before you f*** up my high
# Before you f*** up my high
# Before you f*** up my high
# If you see me in the NYC
# Just walk on by, nigga, just walk on by
# Before you f*** up my high
# Before you f*** up my high
# Before you f*** up my high
# Before you f*** up my high

# Education's corrupt
# It's all f***ed up

# Step two paces....
# Turn and entrapped in the middle of the frontline where the action's at
# Head straight to the scope, it's like hangin on the edge, of a ledge
# I play my part, piece to the puzzle
# Heat's with a muzzle, a YG always in trouble
# Cuz of what he know, cuz of what he knew
# How he grew, up and, what he grew up to
# And what he gon' grow up to be
# It's nuttin wrong but homie don't grow up to be like me
# Temptation to touch, a terrible thing
# A placement in your palm an unbearable thing
# The street has many wars, infiltries, many ways
# Lives lost, many K's, full size and mini K's
# Comin in many arrays
# Many shapes, sizes, and shades
# Cuz boys in blue they just might get you

# Now Bobby and Susy were unhappily wed
# So Bobby shot Susy in the back of the head
# Bobby got taken to the county jail
# He put up his house and he walked on bail
# Now Bobby's on the streets he's free as the breeze
# He saved up his loot for his legal fees
# He spent his whole bank quote on attorneys
# Who got the case dropped on technicalities

# Government's corrupt
# Police force corrupt
# Education's corrupt
# It's all f***ed up
# [Verse 3-Kurupt]
# Through the good and bad times, times bad and good
# Missin all the things that we used to have in the hood
# Things makin me happy, used to make me sad
# It feels like the war of the world, fire in hand
# Spread, head to head like legions of germs
# Wrapped like pearls and shells make 'em wriggle like worms
# We everlastin, Kurupt and Everlast
# Lashin, ever ready sounds, spreadin like rashes
# Life is complicated, Kurupt, Everlast, and Soopafly made it
# For traded, supposedly stay shaded
# They may lurk, but we lurk too
# They create the war, that we fight for
# There's only one life and only one way to be
# God fear gotta give love to the G-O-D cuz I can see
# Everythang's corrupted, I'm corrupted

# I been through the full-court pressure stage
# The homies gave me a nine
# The first time I saw a gauge
# The first time I put my feet...
# Down solid mashin on top of concrete
# Before all the ways of war
# House and car doors felt the rays of war
# When life was simple as sh**
# And we didn't give a f*** about a bi***, 1986
# It's all about lic's, heat in the streets
# Trucks with the beats
# bi***es with biker shorts worn all tight
# Tryin to get a p**** just worn all night
# Plus you had to be a baller to get the baddest ho's
# Back in the days, 6-4 six trays
# Back in the days, Elco's, S-S's
# The best is where the west is niggaz don't test us

# [Verse 2-Fred Durst & Kurupt]
# [Fred Durst]
# Back in the days where them laces were thick
# I was concerned with break dancin and layin some d***
# For whatever it's worth, I'm still doin the smurf
# And I'm walkin on this Earth, like I don't give a f***
# And now I'm rollin up in third gear
# With 3 dollar bills, 3 more minutes to kill
# 3 more seconds to snap, 3 more bottles of beer
# And corrupt's my lifestyle, so shut the f*** up
# And back the f*** up with that buck free style
# Nigga what freestyle, nigga
# [Fred Durst]
# Walkin on a razor blade
# Comin through I got it made, posted up in the shade
# Comin through to get paid
# Sunny California baby

# I got dubbs in my trunk and it's bound to bump
# Straight smashin, hollerin out what's up Kurupt?
# Wassup, I'm fillin in my right mind, one to the head
# And I'm on the smash hollerin out 'what's up Fred?'
# [Chorus X4-DJ Lethal]
# Just lay it on back (Hey)
# Do you wanna ride?
# [Verse 3-Nate Dogg]
# I don't give a f*** so f*** what they say
# Nigga won't you pass, say pass the bombay
# Niggaz they decide to ride and they ride
# Niggaz they decide to lie and they die
# I can bust a fleet of ho's with my skills
# I can make them ho's bow down pay my bills
# Can't think I can make them ho's convert to my will
# Wanna bet I'll turn them ho's to my scrill'
# If you love a bi*** a bi*** can drive you crazy
# Anything a hooker do it won't amaze me
# You better be up on your game homie cuz they be
# They may talk a lot of sh** but they can't fade me
# If you hang around with suckaz then you may be...
# Anotha type of brotha I don't want with me
# When you compensate with bustaz you confuse me
# Cuz I'm tryin to stay out the penitentiary
# [Chorus X4-DJ Lethal]
# Just lay it on back (Hey)
# Do you wanna ride?

# It feels like your life's crashing down all around you
# Let me ask if it's really so bad
# Look at the world in it's suffering
# Can you honestly tell me that know one else could understand
# All the hurting inside
# Why can't you see that freedom is sometimes simply another perspective away
# Who could you be if your lens was changed for a moment,
# Would you still be the same
# A young child looks through a great stained glass window
# Watching the people go by
# Everyone seems to be wearing a red coat
# His mother sees jackets in white
# Now he can't understand why does she see it this way
# Why can't you see that freedom is sometimes simply another perspective away
# Who could you be if your lens was changed for a moment,
# Would you still be the same
# Yesterday, you really couldn't see
# By changing your angle a new world would be
# Revealed to your once blinded eyes by moving a few degrees
# Why can't you see that freedom is sometimes simply another perspective away
# Who could you be if your lens was changed for a moment,
# Would you still be the same

# Fragile, seems I opened up to quick and all my dreams were woken up
# I slowly lost my fight
# with every single man a river cried
# I had no sensation, completely numb I felt no satisfaction
# I thought no one could ever get me high again
# I swear I was not looking
# I've waited so long, I thought the real thing was a fake, I thought it was a tool to break me down
# you prove me wrong again
# If love were liquid it would drown me in a placeless place refine me,
# in a heart shape come around me and then melt me slowly down
# if love were human it would know me in a lost space come and show me,
# hold me and control me and then melt me slowly down, like chocolate
# Tastes so good my hearts been mended, who'd have thought it would?
# an empty bed and still I won the catch, a man who I love and who loves me back
# I've waited so long for love to heal me, so I'd feel it, thought it wasn't real and then you came
# you prove me wrong again
# If love were liquid it would drown me in a placeless place refine me,
# in a heart shape come around me and then melt me slowly down
# if love were human it would know me in a lost space come and show me,
# hold me and control me and then melt me slowly down, like chocolate
# Come here, zoom in, catch the smile
# there's no doubt it's for you and I'm addicted tonight
# Just one look boy to mellow it out
# just one heart here to save me now
# your candy kisses are sweet I know
# hold me tight baby, don't let go

# I wanted to write a song called cosmic

# I wanted the right to misbehave
# To satiate my crave
# I put these things aside for years
# Until laughter took the place of tears
# It?s like I was asleep, yet now I?m here, I?m here
# I wanted to take your place just sometimes
# To know the things you know
# And why you did the things you do
# To say no one time and believe it
# Oh I wanted so much, but only needed you
# Wasn?t it just my choice to make
# The bed in which I laid
# I put these things aside for years
# Until laughter took the place of tears
# It?s like I was asleep, yet now I?m here, I?m here

# I wanted to sing exotic words

# People came from all around

# And ooh, I'm missing you now
# I'm missing you now
# And you turned my world around
# When you bumed this disco down
# Why'd you leave to find yourself
# I can't dance with no-one else
# And still there's memories of this town
# When you bumed this disco down
# It's been ten years now this Sunday
# Since you left or was it Monday
# Time can fly when you're still in love
# And now l boogie in my dreams
# To le Freak or Dancing Queen
# Baby l still recall those things
# And ooh, I'm missing you now
# I'm missing you now
# And you turned my world around
# When you burned this disco down

# In my some kind of bliss
# Cos everyday is all there is
# In my some kind of bliss
# Study my reflection
# and let the colours fall
# Slip into stillness
# And be above it all
# Good to be here
# Time to be alone

# Not succumb to fear

# From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one
# As she stared in my eyes and smiled
# For her lips were the colour of the roses
# That grew down the river, all bloody and wild
# When he knocked on my door and entered the room
# My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
# He would be my first man, and with a careful hand
# He wiped at the tears that ran down my face
# [CHORUS]
# On the second day I brought her a flower
# She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen
# I said, "Do you know where the wild roses grow
# So sweet and scarlet and free?"
# On the second day he came with a single red rose
# Said: "Will you give me your loss and your sorrow?"
# I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed
# He said, "if I show you the roses will you follow?"
# [CHORUS]
# On the third day he took me to the river
# He showed me the roses and we kissed
# And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
# As he stood smiling above me with a rock in his fist
# On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow
# And she lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief
# As I kissed her goodbye, I said, "All beauty must die"
# And lent down and planted a rose between her teeth
