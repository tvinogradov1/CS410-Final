# You think you're free

# You rule my world
# With the breed that's got you

# I'm feeling my mind is
# Blowing me out of place right now
# I cannot deny it
# So I won't and I keep defying
# Those lies you toss, your fake love's a loss
# Is why I can't rely and have no trust
# In you - yes, it's true, I'm thru with you
# Cause if I look back this ain't straight out of the blue
# Hah - you don't have a clue - but - what's up
# With all of these times when you never stood by me
# You never been with me, you never said once at all that you'd miss me
# I can't deny it's true - I can't rely on you
# Chorus:
# Don't have no faith no more in you
# I CAN'T RELY ON YOU
# Can't walk a mile no more with you
# I CAN'T RELY ON YOU
# You're full of lies and nothing's true
# I CAN'T RELY ON YOU
# I know it's tough but true - I can't rely on you
# I wonder have you once
# Tried to walk the way I thought we could
# Selfrighteous, all you stress
# What was right, what was wrong, let me guess
# The thing was never born guess
# I've been ripped and torn
# Just to please your life but now I feel scorn
# You fool - what do you think I am? - a tool?
# I sure will forget your name
# Cool, 'cause I can't stand or understand
# Just how much for your sake,
# Just how much I could take
# When you were trying to break,
# When you were trying to fake
# The whole world I tried to save but now I just hate
# I can't deny it's true - I can't rely on you
> H
# Feel insanity tonight
# Lost with one long cry
# Try to break the loneliness
# No succesful try
# Heard that cry a thousand times
# Did not see the light
# I didn't know him demanding
# One last fatal try
# Now I understand his lonely cry...
# Chorus:
# I heard him cry
# I heard him cry but I didn't know
# I heard him cry, I heard him cry...
# Missed to say good bye that night,
# Haunted by his cry
# I never knew the reason why
# I guess I just thought of 'I'
# Words were drowned by rain or tears
# Didn't know what he said
# I try to recall the happy years
# These minutes just leave me sad
# Now I understand his lonely cry
# Chorus

# It is the shanty in the dear park
# the hide and seek till after dark
# the talks we had at picked fences
# create the blueprints in my heart
# of the way we are

# I see them sliding down on brook bridge
# in tiny boots on icy streets
# the gang we had was so almighty
# tell me the blueprints of my heart
# I wonder where they are...
# the way we are

# Life is feeling dizzy, life is feeling dizzy,
# Life is feeling dizzy, life is feeling dizzy,
# Yeah, I'm in the mood to feel the groove
# I'm gonna push it down and I'm on the move
# Life stands still, for a minute I chill
# My mind is up on a onetrack highway ill-
# Communication is a matter of I
# Ain't got no place to go
# Ain't got no place to hide
# I need to know what I'm all about,
# I try to dig it, damned I'm out

# I'm in the know - no, no, no...
# Life is a treasure that I have to find
# I'm looking for the plan that is hidden in my mind...

# Stuck in the middle of,
# Stuck in the middle of,

# I got to carry on down with soul,
# damned I try to move on.
# But where I stop is in the middle of life,
# beacause I can't figure out the midst in I why
# was I born and why do I have to die,
# I don't know because I'm stuck in the middle
# of life, and now I go and I say good bye,
# I know it's sad and I try to cry
# I try to run and I don't lie,
# I wanna die cause I'm stuck in the middle of life

# now sunlight's there to wake the day, you can express I can't explain
# may be the second that fate meant us to meet again
# your arms give me security, no scent of fatal ambiguity

# Once upon a time I was sitting by,
# a bottle of wine and all I knew was I,
# I was gonna sip it down in a little while,
# I drink it glass for glass but there's no reason why,

# like a lonley stranger in a long lost land,
# I felt the feelings no one ever has,
# Bartender, pour me a glass!

# I'm drinking, I'm not drinking, I can't tell you why,
# how it started, how it ends but I do deny,
# that I wanna ruin my life but now I wanna dive,
# into the silent ocean where there is no cry,
# For hope, for me that I cannot see,
# but if I faced the facts and go inside of me,
# I would see myself, my own reality,
# I would see myself, my own insanity,
# Scared to move another step ahead,
# I would lose the strength so I will fast forget,
# what I do to myself, why don't you take a guess,
# bartender, pour me a glass!

# And the people that rock

# I'm feeling my mind is
# Blowing me out of place right now
# I cannot deny it
# So I won't and I keep defying
# Those lies you toss, your fake love's a loss
# Is why I can't rely and have no trust
# In you - yes, it's true, I'm thru with you
# Cause if I look back this ain't straight out of the blue
# Hah - you don't have a clue - but - what's up
# With all of these times when you never stood by me
# You never been with me, you never said once at all that you'd miss me
# I can't deny it's true - I can't rely on you
# Chorus:
# Don't have no faith no more in you
# I CAN'T RELY ON YOU
# Can't walk a mile no more with you
# I CAN'T RELY ON YOU
# You're full of lies and nothing's true
# I CAN'T RELY ON YOU
# I know it's tough but true - I can't rely on you
# I wonder have you once
# Tried to walk the way I thought we could
# Selfrighteous, all you stress
# What was right, what was wrong, let me guess
# The thing was never born guess
# I've been ripped and torn
# Just to please your life but now I feel scorn
# You fool - what do you think I am? - a tool?
# I sure will forget your name
# Cool, 'cause I can't stand or understand
# Just how much for your sake,
# Just how much I could take
# When you were trying to break,
# When you were trying to fake
# The whole world I tried to save but now I just hate
# I can't deny it's true - I can't rely on you

# Feel insanity tonight
# Lost with one long cry
# Try to break the loneliness
# No succesful try
# Heard that cry a thousand times
# Did not see the light
# I didn't know him demanding
# One last fatal try
# Now I understand his lonely cry...
# Chorus:
# I heard him cry
# I heard him cry but I didn't know
# I heard him cry, I heard him cry...
# Missed to say good bye that night,
# Haunted by his cry
# I never knew the reason why
# I guess I just thought of "I"
# Words were drowned by rain or tears
# Didn't know what he said
# I try to recall the happy years
# These minutes just leave me sad
# Now I understand his lonely cry

# Yeah it's bigger than us!
# I want to see beyond my own little world,
# Grab your hands so we can twirl around the galaxy,
# see the world with clarity,
# Oh-oo-oh,
# We all have a long way to go,
# But I know,
# We�re getting closer everyday,
# Everyday!
# [Chorus]
# We all want to believe in love,
# We all want to believe in something,
# Bigger than just us,
# We all want to be a part,
# Of the greater picture,
# That's hangin' in our heart,
# Yeah bigger than us!
# It fills the universe,
# It lights the skies above,
# It rescues our hearts with love,
# (L.o.v.e, love)with love!(l.o.v.e, love)
# That�s what�s bigger than us! (bigger than us, c'mon)
# It�s love, it�s love, that's bigger than us
# It�s love, it�s love, that's bigger than us
# (Whoo!)

# You tucked me in
# Turned out the light
# Kept me safe and sound at night
# Little girls depend on things like that
# Brushed my teeth and combed my hair
# Had to drive me every where
# You were always there when I looked back
# You had to do it all alone
# Make a living, make a home
# Must have been as hard as it could be
# And when I couldn't sleep at night
# Scared things wouldn't turn out right
# You would hold my hand and sing to me
# Caterpillar in the tree
# How you wonder who you'll be
# Can't go far but you can always dream
# Wish you may and wish you might
# Don't you worry, hold on tight
# [ Hannah Montana Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ]
# I promise you there will come a day
# Butterfly fly away
# (Hold)
# Butterfly fly away(butterfly fly away)
# Got your wings now you can't stay
# Take those dreams and make them all come true
# (Hold)
# Butterfly fly away(butterfly fly away)
# You've bin waiting for this day
# All along and known just what to do
# (Hold)
# Butterfly x3
# Butterfly fly away
# (Hold)
# Butterfly fly away
# (Hold)

# It's 6 am and I'm wide awake
# Cuz I can't stop thinking bout the stuff you were sayin
# Me and I, I can't let it slide
# The papers not here yet
# The suns not up
# But I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel inside
# I had one of those dreams that made it all so
# Clear to me now
# I got a whole new perspective
# It's so clear to me now
# You can't treat me that way
# It appears to me how you tried to make me blame you
# It was me who was bein the fake
# So clear
# Why did I smile when I hurt inside
# Said I was okay when I knew it's a lie
# I wanted to believe in you
# You took your chances
# And one was me
# So I'll just forgive you
# And set you free
# I'm on my way
# Yeah I'm steppin out of the haze
# And it's so
# Clear to me now
# I got a whole new perspective
# It's so clear to me now
# You can't treat me that way
# It appears to me how long you tried to make me blame you
# It was me who was bein the fake
# So clear
# I wanna put the past behind
# Try and maybe I can find better days
# Clear to me now
# I got a whole new perspective
# It's so clear to me now
# You can't treat me that way
# It's so
# Clear to me now
# I got a whole new perspective

# My problem isn't that I miss you

# That you're nothing that I thought you're about
# You're just caught in a place
# That soon time will erase from my heart
# You're my type of guy, I guess
# If I was stuck in East Northumberland High
# For the rest of my life
# But people change
# Thank God I did
# Just because I wanted you then
# Doesn't mean I want you now
# Just because I wanted you then
# Doesn't mean I want you
# Your problem's not for lack of trying
# Cause you do
# Just that you're at your best when you're lyin'
# Now you're here
# Saying things you think I wanted to hear
# But you've got it all wrong
# I've already moved on my dear

# And if I mess it up sometimes,

# Sometimes I work a scheme,
# But then it flips on me
# Doesn’t turn out how I planned,
# Get stuck in quick sand.
# No problem, can’t be solved,
# Once I get involved!
# I try to be delicate,
# Then crash right into it!
# But my intentions are good,
# Sometimes just mis-understood…
# Nobody’s perfect!

# Again and again ’till I get it right.
# Nobody’s perfect!
# You live and you learn it!
# And if I mess it up sometimes,
# Nobody’s perfect!
# I gotta work it!
# I know in time I’ll find the way,
# Nobody’s perfect…Sometimes I fix things up,
# And they fall apart again,
# Nobody’s perfect…
# I know I mix things up,
# But I always get it right in the end… (Oh, You know I do!)
# [Talking]
# Next time you feel like,
# It’s just one of those days,
# When you just can’t seem to win.
# If things don’t go the way that you guys planned,
# Figure something else out!
# Don’t stay down!
# Come on everybody!
# Try again!
# [REPEAT X2]
# Everybody makes mistakes,
# Everybody has those days.
# Everybody know’s what, what I’m talking ’bout,
# Everybody gets that way.
# Nobody’s perfect!
# I gotta work it!
# Again and again til I get it right!
# Nobody’s perfect!
# You live and you learn it!
# And if I mess it up sometimes,
# Nobody’s perfect!
# I gotta work it!
# I know in time I’ll find the way,
# Nobody’s perfect,
# You live and you learn it!
# ‘Cos everybody makes mistakes…Nobody’s perfect.
# Nobody’s! Perfect!
# No No!

# You can love wrong.
# In this love song,
# You can love long
# And if you love wrong,
# It doesn't mean love's gone.
# Whoa.
# It doesn't mean love's wrong
# Just because you're feelin' low.

# 'Cause you feel that you want to
# Let go.
# No one wrote in this book of love
# That you'd always know.
# I wish someone would of told me before.
# Talk about love.
# A million times it seems
# The words come out our lips,
# Like we forgot what it means
# We said we'd be together
# 'Til death do us part
# But we said those words,
# With only half our hearts.
# In this life long,
# Love song.
# You can love right

# Out my window a memory
# I'm dying inside

# Your lonely eyes
# But this is something you can't disguise
# It's not just me, you feel it too
# 'Cause you know I belong with you
# Look at where we're going
# Tell me what can I say
# We're tracing our footsteps
# We're going the same way

# Here we go around again
# You know it, I know it, don't try to pretend
# You know it could be so much better than it's been
# Ooooh, here we go around again
# I was empty inside but I just didn't know
# You are my ten thousand roses and I let you go
# Before I make the same mistake just hold me in your arms
# We belong you know it in your heart
# Look where we're going

# It started at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere
# Sitting beside me was a man with no hair
# >From the look on his face and the size of his toes
# He comes from a place that nobody knows
# Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
# Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
# Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
# If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why
# I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee
# He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie
# He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky
# He says they'll come get him, come get him some day
# He says where he's from is called Albertane
# There they use more than 10% of the brain
# But you couldn't tell it from they way they behave
# They run around in underwear and they never shave
# Or maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
# Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
# Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
# If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

# This is Mother Bird calling Baby Bird
# Baby Bird come in, come in Baby Bird
# For the love of Pete come in!
# This is Baby Bird...sorry I was watching Court TV
# Do you copy? Do you copy?
# Of course we copy...24 hours a day...in color
# You wouldn't believe me if I told you the rest
# The man sitting by me who was barely dressed
# Flew off to Milwaukee or perhaps Albertane
# And left me at the bus stop just barely sane
# I've been sitting here too long thinkin' about Milwaukee
# I've been talking too long on my yellow walkie talkie
# I'm talking to Mars you may think I'm wacky
# I know they'll come get me, come get me someday

# Not so long ago in a toy room not so far away
# Lived a boy who had so many toys
# And he didn't know what to do with them all
# With them all, with them all
# Well his favorite of all the toys were the tin soldiers, the tin soldiers
# And the one that he loved the most was the one with the missing leg
# At night the toys would come alive or that's how the story is told
# And there they met the soldier with the missing leg
# And the ballerina with the heart of gold
# At night they would share each other's dreams
# Under the stars shining bright
# But they were too shy to speak of love, to speak of love
# One day the boy sat him on the window sill
# To watch for the enemy coming over the hill
# But when the wind it blew it knocked him into the street
# And the boys from the town they said
# Won't you look at the one-legged soldier
# Let's stick him in a boat and send him far away
# 'Cause I can't find a use for a soldier with a missing leg
# And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend
# And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend
# As he floated past a river rat
# On his homemade boat
# Well the boat began to sink
# And he sank to the bottom of the river
# He got swallowed by a fish
# Caught by a fisherman
# Sold to the family of the boy who had the toys
# And the cook said look at the one-legged soldier
# It looks just like the one we lost the other day
# Could this be the boy's tin soldier with the missing leg?
# As he sat on the mantel place to dry from the river
# The ballerina who held his heart sat at his side
# And when they got up to dance with each other
# They fell by the fire blazing bright
# When he jumped to save her from the flames
# Their bases began to melt into one in the same
# And now they share each other's destiny
# Together forever they will be
# And they are no longer lonely for a friend
# And they are no longer lonely for a friend
# Not so long ago in a toy room not so far away
# Lived a boy who had so many toys
# And he played with them all
# With them all, with them all
# Well he had a ballerina and a one-legged soldier, stuck together at the base
# And they share each other's destiny as they sit on top of the mantel place
# It's the story of the one-legged soldier
# The story of the one-legged soldier
# The story of the tin soldier with the missing leg

# Everybody wonders and some people know
# I guess that I'm some people 'cause baby it shows
# When will you do it? And why will you go?
# If you've already decided then deliver the blow
# The way you walk around me. The way you talk around me.
# You act so speechless. You've got nothing to say.
# The way you walk around me. The way you're talking to me.
# Makes me wonder. If this was only play.
# And I wonder will you still love me?
# Do you still love me, like you did before.
# Said come on baby you think I'm so blind
# I see what you're doing behind my back all the time
# I get suspicious when you call me someone else's name
# You think I don't notice that nothing's the same...anymore
# (Repeat Chorus)
# And I wonder will you still love me?
# Did you ever love me, or were you playing with me before
# Ohh baby you think I'm so blind
# Ohh baby I'm not playing around this time

# And I wonder will you still love me?
# Did you ever love me, or are you showing me the door
# Ohh baby you think I'm so blind

# Lyrics: Sitting on the corner of nowhere road
# Just between I wish I could and I don't know
# Rain is splashing up between her toes
# She doesn't know her own area code
# She's a picture of a heart of gold
# On the edge of depression unknown
# And the picture of the wrong I wrote
# Now it's too late for a fight or fold
# Now she's looking at me to know
# The faucet's running and my car got towed
# Chrous
# I'm sure about it
# I'm definitely sure that I do surely doubt it
# I wish that I could say that I was sure about it
# But I'm definitely sure that I'm not sure
# Did you see the man with the cocaine load
# It's on sale for the price of your soul
# And the man with a long trench coat
# Wish you could hide in a big black hole
# Sell all your pain ten fold
# And you're crawling down a long, wrong road
# Fitted for the box they mold
# All you're mixing is the heart they stole
# Now they're looking at me to know
# My heart is pumping and my feet got cold
# Chorus
# I'm sure about it
# I'm definitely sure that I do surely doubt
# I wish that I could say that I was sure about it
# But I'm definitely sure that I'm not sure
# I'm definitely sure that I'm not...
# Sure...I'm sure that I'm not...
# Sure
# Sitting on the corner of nowhere road
# Just between I wish I could and I don't know
# There's a man with a long trench coat
# Wish I could hide in a big black hole
# Now they're looking at me to know
# My heart is pumping and my feet got cold
# Chorus
# I'm sure about it
# I'm definitely sure that I do surely doubt it
# I wish that I could say that I was sure about it

# I'm definitely sure that I do surely doubt it

# As surely as the sun rises each day
# So my love will never change
# And though the years may come and go

# I want to share every moment of the day with you
# And I want to share every sunset and sunrise

# Isn't it weird. Isn't it strange.
# Even though we're just two strangers on this runaway train
# We're both trying to find a place in the sun
# We've lived in the shadows, but doesn't everyone
# Isn't it strange how we all feel a little bit weird sometimes
# Isn't it hard. Standing in the rain.
# You're on the verge of going crazy and your heart's in pain
# No one can hear though you're screaming so loud
# You feel all alone in a faceless crowd
# Isn't it strange how we all get a little bit weird sometimes.
# Sitting on the side. Waiting for a sign. Hoping that my luck will change.
# Reaching for a hand that can understand, someone who feels the same.
# When you live in a cookie cutter world being different is a sin.
# So you don't stand out. And you don't fit in. Weird.
# Sitting on the side. Waiting for a sign. Hoping that my luck will change.
# Reaching for a hand that can understand, someone who feels the same.
# When you live in a cookie cutter world if you're different you can't win.
# So you don't stand out and you don't fit in. Weird.
# Isn't it strange how we all feel a little bit weird
# Strange, how we all get a little bit.
# Strange, 'cause we're all just a little bit weird sometimes.

# More than sad, it makes me mad to know somebody knows
# There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?
# Poor Katie, she won't even speak his name
# None of us will ever be the same

# (Lyrics by Sandy Chapin)
# My child arrived just the other day,
# He came to the world in the usual way.
# But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay.
# He learned to walk while I was away.
# And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew,
# He'd say, "I'm gonna be like you, dad.
# You know I'm gonna be like you."
# And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
# Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
# "When you coming home, dad ?" "I don't know when,
# But we'll get together then.
# You know we'll have a good time then."
# My son turned ten just the other day.
# He said, "Thanks for the ball, dad, come on let's play.
# Can you teach me to throw ?" I said, "Not today,
# I got a lot to do." He said, "That's ok."
# And he walked away, but his smile, lemme tell you,
# Said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah.
# You know I'm gonna be like him."
# And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
# Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
# "When you coming home, dad ?" "I don't know when,
# But we'll get together then.
# You know we'll have a good time then."
# Well, he came from college just the other day,
# So much like a man I just had to say,
# "Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while ?"
# He shook his head, and he said with a smile,
# "What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys.
# See you later. Can I have them please ?"
# And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
# Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
# "When you coming home, son ?" "I don't know when,
# But we'll get together then, dad.
# You know we'll have a good time then."
# I've long since retired and my son's moved away.
# I called him up just the other day.
# I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind."
# He said, "I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time.
# You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu,
# But it's sure nice talking to you, dad.
# It's been sure nice talking to you."
# And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me,
# He'd grown up just like me.
# My boy was just like me.
# And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
# Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
# "When you coming home, son?" "I don't know when,
# But we'll get together then, dad.
# You know we'll have a good time then."

# It had to be you
# It had to be you
# I wandered around
# And finally found
# Somebody who
# Could make me be true
# Could make me be blue
# Or even be glad just to be sad
# Thinking of you
# Some others I've seen
# Might never be mean
# Might never be cross
# Or try to be boss
# But they would't do
# For nobody else gave me a thrill
# With all of your faults
# I love you still
# It had to be you
# Wonderful you
# It had to be you

# I had visions, I was in them

# Rottenness and evil in me

# Mine can't forget the curves of your body

# I run it up the flagpole and see who salutes

# And I'm so hot cause I'm in hell
# Been around the world and found
# That only stupid people are breeding
# The cretins cloning and feeding
# And I don't even own a tv
# Put me in the hospital for nerves

# And rage against machines
# I wanna pierce my tongue

# I'd like to turn off time
# And kill my mind
# You kill my mind
# Paranoia! Paranoia!
# Everybody's coming to get me
# Just say you never met me
# I'm going underground with the moles
# Hear the voices in my head
# I swear to God it sounds like they're snoring
# But if you're bored then you're boring
# The agony and the irony, they' re killing me

# My first day, without you in my life
# Things felt strange, a bit deranged
# Even so, I hope you're doin okay
# Take it slow, you just never know... ( just never know, oh!)
# Yo, you just never know... nooo (just never know, oh!)
# You just never know... nooo (just never know, oh!)
# ( Verse 1 )
# My systems caught in conniption, stomach in knots
# Feedin for my medicine, overcoming addiction
# The first step is quittin, nah the first steps admittin
# I got a problem, I need help, this is something I can't beat myself
# I almost felt like I can't be cured
# Rehab won't take me cuz I ain't insured
# Layin in the bath tub, shakin like a new born
# Searchin for the courage it'll take for me to move on
# I've been livin life like this way too long
# Beggin God please, bring me home
# I stopped before, three or four days
# Always end up back in the same place
# People call me a junkie, dope fiend
# How they gonna judge me, they don't even know me
# Lights off, wanna be left alone, I'm tryin to enjoy the methodone
# Put a Jimi Hendrix record on, and excuse me while I kiss the sky
# Dosed off, woke up, sick to my stomach, ran to the bathroom
# Started to vomit, the methodone wore off and the withdrawal started
# That first day was the hardest...
# ( Chorus )
# ( Verse 2 )
# Stayed strong, endured the rough weather
# I ain't fully recovered but I'm doin much better
# I can keep my food down to shakes and calms
# They lowerin the doses of methodone
# I eat V's and blow lots of dro
# It's like chewin gum when you're tryin not to smoke
# Keep my mind occupied, calm my nerves
# It's not the same high, deep inside I...
# Just want one more but I can't turn back this week for it
# But I done made it, almost a month
# With just a couple of V's and I blew some blunts
# But that weed and gonna make me OD
# That other shit was gonna kill me
# Six weeks, and everything seem so clear
# Before I knew it, time flew and I was clean for a year
# Can't believe something started off socially
# Something I almost allowed to take over me
# Days went by and it was sixteen months
# And I swear to God I didn't fall off once
# I, feel like a brand new guy and I'm definetly livin a brand new life
# Some days I still resist the thirst but none's worst than the first (believe
# that)
# ( Chorus )
# ( Verse 3 )
# Two years and I ain't touched it
# Got a lot done, I been so productive
# Rebuilt, I was so constructive
# Can't believe I was so self destructive
# Got a good job and I make big bucks
# Went to the lot and got a new pick up
# Got a brand new crib and a brand new kid
# I think anybody can quit if I did
# If you wanna quit, get up and go get the shit
# Walk straight to the toilet, drop it, flush it, fuck it, fight it
# Just resist it and if this helps then just keep listenin
# When you start slippin I'll send you another one
# Sonny, wasup?, we just saved another one
# I know it's so hard like there's no God
# But through him you're able to go so far
# Hey, I don't wanna sound corny
# I'm just like you either hungry or horny
# Seems as though we get hooked so easily
# Quitting becomes an impossibility
# I ain't sayin treat your body like a church
# Just don't let dope put your body in a hearse
# The streets inside you, you just gotta search
# And know that no day be harder than the first

# ( Verse 1 )
# I was born a bastard, my mama was a baby
# And she didn't have the skills it would ever take to raise me
# Pops jumped ship and left us doin bad
# I pretty much blame him for everything I never had
# Fall back cuz I remember I was always mad
# Constantly in trouble, I was always bad
# Used to whip my ass for stealin and skippin class
# Just basically fuckin up, they said I was nothing but a fuck up
# Your fuckin nuts, just wait and see
# I can't wait to make them eat that shit they talk bout me
# I'm gonna make granny proud of me
# Be someone that I can be, proud to be
# They ain't gonna make no ass out of me
# How did we, overcome such obstacles and setbacks
# They told me I was average but I just couldn't accept that
# Let that, be those words carved in my headstone
# P. S. you hatin muthafuckas were dead wrong
# ( Chorus ) 2x
# Told you muthafuckas I won, I was gon do it
# I was gon do it, still you doubted me... still you doubted me
# ( Verse 2 )
# Day turn to night, I paid the cost for the fame
# I was drawn to the game like a moth to a flame
# Guess you could say I had a troublesome past
# Rememberin talkin to mama, talking through glass
# The look in her eye, boy I'm so sick of your ass
# You're never gonna change, you're just like your dad (damn!)
# A look in her face that told me I was mistake
# She wish she had never made, goes from back from in the day
# What came from the grave, was a message she didn't wanna hear
# Remember that trip from hell, well here's your little souvenir
# Don't drink no Belvedere, I blow that killer smoke
# I hit that volume button and let them guerillas go
# You didn't know or see the growth through the concrete
# Makin million dollars merely speakin over drum beats
# Yes did, been telling you since I was a kid
# And you was bonded, get on with that bullshit
# ( Chorus ) 2x
# ( Verse 3 )
# I rolled my eyes, as if to say fuck all y'all
# All I ever had was my muthafuckin Paw Paw
# My gramma, fed me catfish and coleslaw
# I hit the weed then pass it to my road dog
# I grip the steering wheel, I'm mashin gas pedal
# Bitch, I'm gonna be here when the muthafuckin dust settles
# Probably been off if I had just let go
# I wonder where I'd be in life if I just said no
# But life's too short for me to ponder questions I'll never answer
# But why am I still smoking from all I've lost from cancer
# At this point in life, all my worries are financial
# And any losses that I have to take will be substantial
# I'm not stopping because it's not an option
# Get it straight, I'm not sweepin and not moppin
# A muthafuckin thing, you get that boss
# And all that real job talk just piss Stak off

# Je blizu stoletje, ko vigredi cvetje več vzklilo ne bo,
# Naj zvoki, besede, le stiske in zmede v balade nam stko?
# Je konec iskanja, bo teža spoznanja pregnala nemir,

# It was a rainy night
# When he came into sight
# Standing by the road
# With no umbrella, no coat
# So I pulled up along side
# And I offered him a ride
# He accepted with a smile
# So we drove for awhile
# I didn’t ask him his name
# The lonely boy in the rain
# Fate tells me it’s right
# Is this love at first sight
# Please don’t make it wrong
# Just stay for the night
# All I wanna do is make love to you
# Say you will, you want me too
# All I wanna do is make love to you
# I got loving arms to hold on to
# So we found this hotel
# It was a place I knew well
# We made magic that night
# Oh, he did everything right
# He brought the woman out of me
# So any times easily
# And in the morning when he woke
# All I left him was a note
# I told him, “I am a flower, you are the sea”
# We walked in the garden, we planted a tree
# Don’t try to find me, please don’t you dare
# Just live in memory, you’ll always be there
# All I wanna do is make love to you
# One night of love was all we knew
# All I wanna do is make love to you
# I got loving arms to hold on to, oh
# Ooh, we made love
# Love like strangers
# All night long
# We made love
# Then it happened one day
# We came ‘round the same way
# You could imagine his surprise
# When he saw his own eyes
# I said, “Please, please understand
# I’m in love with another man”
# And what he couldn’t give me, ho, oh
# Was the one little thing that you can
# All I wanna do is make love to you
# One night of love is all we knew
# All I wanna do is make love to you
# Come on, say you will, you want me too
# All I wanna do is make love to you
# One night of love was all we knew
# All I wanna do is make love to you
# Say you will, baby, want me too all night long
# All I wanna do is make love to you

# Anyway, as I was saying before we got all blown away - oh man

# I down need - deep I bleed for love
# Wise ones say seize the day
# Waste not time make your mind for love
# We'll ride that rollercoaster up and down
# No promise that we'll never crash to the ground
# Same old day same old race
# Just in case find a place for love
# All to taste little grace of love
# When days are gray we go downtown
# We'll walk around and talk and talk it out
# Under the cover of the old marquee see colors on the twilight street
# We find a shelter in each other now the rain is like a symphony
# I down need - deep I bleed for love
# I down need - deep I bleed for love
# I down need - I bleed

# Kickin' down the darkness
# Kick it on down the drain
# Kill the superstition
# Gotta get a state of grace
# It's the oldest story in the world
# There is nowhere left to hide
# So we take it all in stride
# When there's no more asking why
# There is nothing left to do
# But love-baby love-baby love you
# Crash the television
# Thrash those games and fools
# Gotta get a resolution
# Better go go back to school
# Fair-weather friends and fair-weather cool
# Righteous the right buy all the bad news
# Rich up the rich and dumb down the poor
# Take it no more

# Do you see me ~ do I see you
# And all the footprints we left in this room
# A smile in the hall ~ framed on the wall
# Do we way words that rise and fall like the circles of blue
# Shoes on the floor ~ they're intertwined
# Just like the touch we left behind
# Walk through the door and say no more
# Say no more easy alibis to put out the fire
# (chorus)
# It's the perfect goodbye
# No time no tell ~ as from your lips the words that never fell
# It's a simple farewell
# No fight no flight ~ no live no die
# No me no cry cry cry cry
# No me no cry
# Hang up the phone ~ I should have known
# Better alone that killing time with fake valentines
# (chorus)
# I'll see you sometime ~ once in awhile
# No partners in crime ~ just a face in the file

# Whoo, yeah.
# Sometimes I wake up in the dark night.
# And in my mind there's a picture of you.
# I know someday this dream will come alive.
# So for now your shadow will do.
# I've never seen your face but I know you're in my heart.
# Baby some day, some place, I'll hold you in my arms.
# I have a gift for you. Something I've held on to.
# Waiting for your sweet caress. (Sweet caress.)
# No ribbon has been untied from all that I hold inside.
# And only you will possess
# This heart of innocence.
# I lay my head down on a pillow of white.
# Here in the dark, I am cradled in peace.
# No loss from yesterday to harm me at night.
# No tears to dry. No sad memories.
# There's a heart to hold and I will safely keep
# The strength that's in my soul
# Until you come to me.
# I have a gift for you. Something I've held on to.
# Waiting for your sweet caress.
# No ribbon has been untied from all that I hold inside.
# And only you will possess
# This heart of innocence.
# Every night I make a wish before I fall asleep. (I'll make a wish.)
# That destiny will take your hand and lead it to me.
# Oh.
# I have a gift for you. Something I've held on to.
# Waiting for your sweet caress.

# And I'm not gonna stand in your way
# I loved her first and I held her first
# And a place in my heart will always be hers
# From the first breath she breathed
# When she first smiled at me
# I knew the love of a father runs deep
# And I prayed that she'd find you someday
# But it still hard to give her away
# I loved her first
# How could that beautiful women with you
# Be the same freckle face kid that I knew
# The one that I read all those fairy tales to
# And tucked into bed all those nights
# And I knew the first time I saw you with her
# It was only a matter of time
# But I loved her first and I held her first
# And a place in my heart will always be hers
# From the first breath she breathed

# I knew the love of a father runs deep
# And I prayed that she'd find you someday
# But its still hard to give her away
# I loved her first
# From the first breath she breathed
# When she first smiled at me
# I knew the love of a father runs deep
# Someday you might know what I'm going through
# When a miracle smiles up at you

# And watch the sun rise today
# Higher and higher in a rainbow sky
# All the stars at night
# Everybody sing
# Nearer and nearer to the heart of everything
# Once a voice unheard, now I hear every word
# Of the days and nights we spent in the Garden of Eden
# We start the race so full of hope
# And then we find we've lost all sense of soul
# Are we past the point of no return
# We live a life of want, not need
# Let's live a life of pride, not greed
# I dare you to dance in te rain
# And watch the sun rise today
# Higher and higher in a rainbow sky
# All the stars at night

# I love my family
# 'Specially my mother and my father
# I wanna thank you for being so strong
# God bless you, I love you
# Sometimes I sit back, relax, sip on Cognac, reminscin
# on how it used to be, when we were kids
# Laughin at the things that we did (uh-huh)
# Damn near broke but we knew how to live, peep the scene
# Mom and dad, bustin they ass, 14 years
# In the night they would pass, each other
# Tryin to raise six of us - one sister, four brothers
# Two deceased, laid to rest
# And I miss you cats, what I wouldn't give to bring you back
# To fill the void that you left in my heart
# Your last breath really tore me apart
# And I'm sorry if I never said I loved you enough
# I truly did

# Speakin of kids?  Yours - beautiful
# Promisin, beautiful, I wish you could see 'em
# So much of life, with a touch of yo' light
# And I'm doin my best, to make sure they alright
# When I was young, some big kids stole my bike
# Came home and told y'all and had it back that night
# When I was older you started smokin and you sold my bike
# I remember cause I cried all night; I wasn't mad
# I was sad cause the crack had control of your life

# She said your brother's buggin out, hurry up, take a look
# I grabbed my brother Floyd and we started to book (run run)
# It wouldn't take long, he lived right around the block
# I tried to stay strong, but I was shakin a lot (I'm scared)
# Got there, ran up the stairs, he was stretched out in the lobby
# A 7-year jail bid physique graced his body
# I fell to my knees, like no Jerry please
# I was frightened, he was fightin to breathe
# Mumblin somethin "Heav' don't let 'em take me I ain't ready to leave"
# I felt his clutch on the cuff of my sleeve, then it eased
# He felt calm, as he died in my arms
# OD's off of heron, and just like that, he was gone
# Thanksgiving day will forever be hard
# Cause that's the day we gave my brother to God, ma you hear me?
# Thanksgiving day will forever be hard

# Protect your fertible, sex convertible, Lex and a Rolex
# Content, on how to get jeans, I know thieves and criminals
# Buff thugs who show love, backrubs from dimes and dub
# Hotties with narcotic bodies, my style is urgent
# A rap merchant, a major player with flavor
# Well it's the H-E, you see me, A-V-Y, that be me
# The dress code a pain, some things never change huh

# [Intro: Hell Razah]
# Oh yeah, all in Red Hook
# Hustlin', standin' on shit blocks
# For hours, 'til the sky crack the next day
# [Chorus: Hell Razah]
# Y'all don't wanna see us blow
# Y'all don't wanna see us with dough
# Y'all don't wanna see us flow
# Hell no, we glow
# You knew it was the end the way we came in the door
# Hit the club and I'ma leave with ya ho, ho, ho
# My flames be hot, every time that I throw
# Ain't nothin' new, son I did this before, a G.G.O
# My niggaz flip money like it ain't no mo'
# Cause ain't no friends if it ain't no mo'
# [Verse One: Hell Razah]
# On the dirty blocks of Red Hook we learned to get our first check book
# Be a crook and let the cocaine cook
# Little brothers turn to workers, cops draw guns just to surge us
# And question us about the murders until we figure why God cursed us
# And that this wicked world was never worth us
# We show respect to the ones who birthed us
# Took care of us on welfare, we grown now
# Belchin' from beers, smokin' weed in the project stairs
# Half of my peers got hit with like 15 years
# And the A's we was at was like 16 years
# The graves is callin', opened up for slaves that's fallen
# As the ghetto take the lives of those made for ballin'
# Layin' in coffins, cries to the church organ
# Some will hustle till six in the mornin' just for the fortune
# For a new whip, a venom for flossin', bought a Benz from the auto auction
# We broke his window with a piece of porcelain
# We stay strapped for those jealousy cats
# Layin' hats the same place they do their felonies at
# You ain't the only one who sell crack and got gats
# A lot of niggaz got that, soul left with death and never got back
# Some will cock back and pop that, so pop shit without that
# Be careful what you follow if you ain't about that
# I'm the R to the A to the S in the flesh
# Don't forget, I'm all about cash, credit and checks
# I'ma rap to the death, till Christ resurrect
# No less, I come as a threat, get it correct
# Hip Hop is a way of life, it's in my breath
# The way I breathe, I step not the way I dress
# East to West throw your arms right to left
# Give me a mic and a crowd and a turntable set
# Ancient twelve, I play with the fires of hell
# Only role models that I had was dyin' in jail
# Crack sales make a black male wanna weed dwell
# 600 Benz shittin with a hot female
# All I wanna do is records and pay my bills
# Why I gotta be hater? Cause I say what I feel?
# I say a prayer then I aim before I spray at will
# Y'all only make me wanna kill if you delay my deal
# Hurry up and get them contracts, facts and crills
# Or I'ma have to put out .38 stainless steel
# Engineer, turn my beat up and watch me spill
# Hot lava, my throat burns like straight shots of Vodka
# Ready To Die like Big Poppa
# I put the curse on a witchdoctor
# It's 2G, y'all better spit proper
# I like my shorty when she in Prada
# You make no sense to this big dollar
# I want the cash money, fuck a Oscar
# Motherfucker

# Henny and G's, I'm guaranteed to pop off
# My single is hot from out of the sleeve, I murder two M.C.'s
# [Chorus 2X: Hell Razah]
# Life in the projects (ain't no tellin' who gon' die next)
# Livin' in the hood (ain't no tellin' who gon' die next)
# Buildin' with my brother (ain't no tellin' who gon' die next)
# Live in the hell hole (ain't no tellin' who gon' die next)
# [Hell Razah]
# All my brothers raise in peace..
# It's Hell in here, fear death row, electric chairs
# The time is near, riots in Times Square
# We sick of welfare, doing labor in the slaves career afros, no wavy hair
# No charity pair, on Black Saladatory Day
# We gotta overthrow the government, the Maccabee way
# They out to stop my airplane, cuz they fear what I say
# But my people got ears, and can't hear what I say
# The poor is hated, even by his own neighbors
# But the rich have many friends, and traders, ho's and playa haters
# Some die, lost they life, cuz of foolish anger
# A mad man, only one letter short from danger
# We inhabit, live in the land of strangers
# Family famin, breakin' every ten commandment
# Take ya life for granted, on the Christ's planet
# Firin' cannons, cocked at whoever standing
# As road blocks to quiet planning
# Cops harass us, even though they trespass us
# You not allowed to serve two masters
# We lost sheep from the lost pastors
# [Chorus 2X]

# Thunder, flash and lightening is working on my back
# The tables in the kitchen are tryin' to break my neck
# All the late night memories are leaning in my shoes
# My mother's old grey leather gloves are singing loud the blues
# I can taste what's in the sun
# No time to waste 'cause there is none
# When I feel blue I see it shine
# But still it's true I'm doin' fine
# You can't see me 'cause now I'm all free
# Now you know I'm through
# And all that's not new
# Sitting on a paperback 'cause I don't know what really cracks
# I'm tryin' to climb my pencil to get high
# No one tells me what to do 'cause no one knows what I've been through
# You don't know a thing but you can learn
# It's time to touch the sky
# My mind is free I fly
# I can taste. . .

# Two lifes, one fate

# So will you follow me?
# That's how it's meant to be
# I reigned as God
# I'm monumental
# Soon I will arise
# With you by my side
# And we will radiate the skies
# He who will gaze our lights
# Will kill his mind, his vision blind
# Tonight we are stars
# Stars that shine on bright
# Tonight we are stars
# Stars immortal light
# Tonight we are stars
# All treasures all goods
# We bury where we lay down to die
# And pay for paradise
# Await the highest thorn of all
# And who will gaze our lights
# Will kill his mind, is going blind
# Tonight we are stars

# To stand when I'm lickin' shots, if not, I got the bright red dots
# Station, on top of the four-four, to blow ya fuckin' face in, Jason
# Ain't half as scary as the derriere
# Kicker, mister flipster, various to late
# I hit ya, if you don't think I make ya block ache
# The, next time I come through it'll be you Joe
# That I break a, snake a, pigskin in the wind
# Chant my Boot Camp name, and Rock must defend
# Burn the bitch ass with ten nails, in my military jail
# Make all that diesel shit you poppin' turn frail
# What, like I can, I pumps lead into yo body, punk
# Or a punk pellet, too, I got my pump shotty
# Why these cats always askin', for shit them not want
# The jokes you bump, is crippled for months, and don't front
# Fuckin' punk ---

# Straight from the under, I make niggaz wonder
# Why, I tap jaws, rock black eyes
# See I, know nothing about things I be doing
# Lives I ruin, in this here shit we persuing
# My parabellum means swelling, cerebellum when we dwelling
# The caucazoid, you void, my niggaz rebellin'
# Who in the hell ever, said you can dwell wether
# Or not, I sever your knot, with the shots so whatever I
# What, you don't wanna battle me, battle me, that'll be
# The day my whole posse rushes your monkey ass like Cato G
# True warrior, conquerer, takin' flights, yo
# Watch a nugget, I love it when niggaz on sight
# [Chorus: Heltah Skeltah]
# Will all true warriors in the house say "I"
# Say "I", if you not scared to die
# You can look a nightmare square in the eye, say "I"
# Soldiers gone pyscho, why?
# I be your Boot Camp, veteran, faggots know better than
# To test me, see I gets nasty like hedicin
# So who say, not me, or Ruck gon' be Saddam
# Boy, you moms should of warned you about a walking time bomb
# I breaks arms and legs, and straight up I bend that ass
# So semi in that Henny, and we punk for me to bash 'em
# Then ask Ruck, the irrational, here to bash a few
# To, after who, you, whose your face to crack the brew
# Then laugh at you, what's the, matter, dudes
# Walking through my avenue, flappin' about
# You wanna battle, dude, have a capitol
# That'll do that ass a little justice
# Don't fuck with the mothafuckin' Rock and the Ruckness
# So all true warriors in the house say "I"
# If you scared to die, then punk, don't reply
# The year born copper, I sworn to devour
# The unjustice crush the ones who are cowards
# So act like it can't happen...
# Act like the Originoo Gunn's don't be Clappin'
# When the bitch ruckus reacting
# I slap fools, relax with tools in my presence
# Cuz that ain't shit, because your murder is the essence
# So who wanna come test this champion sound?
# Can't go un'ground, with the lyrics that pound
# Profound is the way that I talk, plus
# Muthafuckin' stoned is the way of my walk, what
# Your jaw's up for grabs, beef, I'm bringin'
# Swingin', right to left, side, gets wrecked
# You think I'mma ass, money, don't hold ya breath
# Let's, take this move, the dungeon to darkness
# When guns bark, it's war for real, kid, don't start this
# Rockness, Monsta, stomp ya, braids in
# Never changing, forever face rearrangin'
# Your gamin', the game, kid, you know that shit don't work
# So bring ya game here, and get ya stupid ass hurt
# No under dirt, we won't lay that, don't say jack
# I can get ya back sprayed, or ya face smacked
# And my black Smif-N-Wessun, that'll show me foldin'
# Now who want come and test the champion, Boot Camp'ion' Soldier

# Lyrics Transcribed by Leonie's Team Member - Tha Pearl
# Once I was afraid, I was petrified
# Kept thinkin I could never live without you by my side
# Then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
# Then I grew strong, and I learned how to get along
# And so your back from outer space
# I just looked in to find you here with that
# I said look for your face
# Should have changed the stupid lock
# Should have made you leave the key
# If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
# Oh, now go, walk out the door
# Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
# Word to the one who tried to hurt me with a lie
# You think I'd crumble, you think I'd lay down and die?
# Oh no, not I, I will survive
# For as long as I know how to love I know I'm still alive
# I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
# And I'll survive, I will survive
# If you've all the strength I have not to fall apart
# Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
# And I spent, oh, so many nights feeling sorry for myself
# I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
# Yeah, you see me, somebody new
# I'm not that gentle little girl that's still in love with you
# Now you felt like dropping in and expect me to be free
# Now I'm savin all my lovin for someone who's loving me
# Boy, now go, walk out the door
# Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
# Word to the one who tried to hurt me with a lie
# You think I'd crumble, you think I'd lay down and die?
# Oh no, not I, I will survive
# For as long as I know how to love I know I'm still alive
# I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
# And I'll survive, I will survive

# Nine o'clock in the morning, yes, I got dressed
# Thought about my girl with the big fat breast
# So I called her up and asked could I see her today

# Hung up the phone, then I threw on my clothes
# I pulled some tissue off the roll to blow the boogers out my nose
# Put on my chain and my boots and things
# Bout to step out the house and heard the telephone ring
# I grabbed the telephone just to see what was up
# She said, "Gimme the place and time and we could hook up"
# I said, "Okay then, why don't you meet me in the park?
# At a quarter to five, cause at six it get dark"
# She said she didn't mind, okay it's on
# So I grabbed my Skanless jacket, then I hung up the phone
# I stepped out the house, smilin and grinnin

# I bailed five or six blocks with a skip and a hop
# Mmh... what's that smell? Oh, the flower shop
# Now I pulled a lotta girlies out they panty hose
# And never never have I ever bought a chick no rose
# But that day I had to be the Life Saver
# To top it all off, I rushed to 31 Flavors
# The girl said she loved me, she said I was cute
# But all I thought about was just knockin her boots
# I thought about doin it with no hesitation
# Now I'm sittin in the park just waitin

# Now I'm sittin on a bench with my back against the fence
# Hi-C's not dumb, I got a gang of sense

# I seen my homies comin and my butt puckered up
# They said, "There go the homie Crawf, hey Hi-C, what's up?"
# I grabbed the roses, tried to hide 'em behind my back

# And aroused crowds in Sao Paulo with a single sentence
# I penetrate the language barriers with positive vibes
# And bridge gaps with raps, keeping my spirit alive and I've
# Thrived, as I roam through zones
# Collecting my paper with these poems and songs
# Getting the girl, grabbing the money and running
# Starting up companies and keeping the product coming
# Hieroglyphics' adventures all around the globe
# Mental enrichment, and we gotta get the dough!
# So go on and go where you wanna go
# See what you wanna see
# Be who you wanna be
# You say, "Just trust me", and I do
# You know it's just a phone call away

# I still remember the ways that you touched me
# Now I know I don't mean anything to you
# You're Easy Breezy and I'm Japaneesy

# And that means...
# You look stupid telling all your friends how you got the best of me
# I intended to share the pleasure only
# Now I look stupid
# We're living in a world with a lot of pressure
# It's quite unneeded to put some pressure on me
# You came and went and left my house
# Like a breeze just passing by
# Hello, Goodbye
# You left a note saying ''Twas nice stopping by'
# I should've never let you inside

# Does that mean anything to you
# Easy Breezy
# Do you whistle to hide that you're feeling lonely
# How do I breathe with all this pressure on me
# Easy Breezy
# When you wrestle, you know that you hurt somebody
# How do I breathe with all this pressure on me
# You came and went and left my house
# Like a breeze just passing by

# 'Twas nice of you to stop by
# Would it amuse you if I told you that I...

# Late at night I think about you sometimes
# I don't cry, I wonder if you're alright
# Late at night I think about you sometimes
# Wonder why I wonder if you're alright
# Thinking of the love we made
# Ran around, out of town, now you're back again
# Confusing true love and pain
# Threw it down, now I'm back on my feet again
# Are you asleep
# Or are you still afraid of the dark
# Hugs and kisses, pictures and romances
# Things that I wish I could do without
# How many nights did I wander in the dark
# Counting secrets of my heart
# Now and then I wonder 'bout
# Who's eating, sleeping with you now
# How many times did I kiss you in the dark
# Watching memories depart
# Then again I wonder 'bout
# But I don't give a damn about you
# Take a bite; the pleasure is all mine
# Keep in mind I'll think about you sometimes
# I'm alright; I'll think about you and I'll...
# Turn this plight into a singer's delight
# Living in a house of pain
# Ran away, and I'm glad that I ran away
# Rather be out in the rain
# Now I understand why my mother ran away
# No use asking
# When did I start acting like such a jerk (you too)
# Washing dishes, birthday wishes, watching baseball matches
# The other future that I wonder 'bout
# So many things I wish I didn't wonder 'bout
# How many nights did I wander in the dark
# Counting secrets of my heart
# Now and then I wonder 'bout
# Who's eating, sleeping with you now
# How many times did I kiss you in the dark

# Never change the way you are
# Trying to catch your eye
# Things will never look the same

# There I go again

# How can I explain

# You're burning up my dreams
# Crazy as it seems
# I don't wanna be anywhere but here
# Anywhere but here
# What goes on inside
# Is a mystery no doubt
# A roller coaster ride
# I may never work it out
# Here's the brand new me
# Skates around and floats on air

# You have set me free

# Telling lies
# Well that's no surprise
# Can you see them
# See right through them
# They have no shield
# No secrets to reveal
# It doesn't matter what they say
# In the jealous games people play
# Our lips are sealed
# There's a weapon
# Which we must use
# In our defense
# Silence
# Spreading rumors
# So far from true
# Dragged up from the underworld
# Just like some precious pearl
# It doesn't matter what they say
# In the jealous games people play
# Our lips are sealed
# Pay no mind to what they say
# It doesn't matter anyway
# Our lips are sealed
# Hush my darling
# Don't you cry
# Quiet angel
# Forget their lies
# Can you hear them

# So shut up and listen
# I don?t want you to look past me
# I want you to know who I am
# I hate it when you ignore me
# You just don?t understand
# See the funny thing is
# You?re just as useless as me
# I can make you better

# And I can?t get through
# No more looking for beauty that?s dying inside me
# Cant you see?

# And I?m so confused
# You keep missing the small things
# The safety that love brings
# Can?t you see?
# I?m outside of you
# You?re only plan to survive
# It needs love and light to grow
# I could be something beautiful
# I guess you?ll never know
# See the funny thing is
# You?re just as lonely as me
# We could be so much better
# If you would just let me in

# I?m silently screaming to set me free

# Finally every tear has dried
# I've wiped you from my life
# Do you remember all the times you said you'd call me
# 'Cause I remember all the reasons people warned me
# And now I hear you saying that you still adore me
# But if you think I'd ever get with you again
# Then you can just
# Love me, love me

# If you want me back again
# Burn into the sky

# Boys like you never change
# You made me feel I wasn't enough
# Wasn't enough for your love

# It wasn't me

# Ooh, by the way, by the way
# I've found someone who gives me space
# Keeps me safe
# Makes me sane
# Found someone to take your place
# Now I'm safe in his arms
# And I decided only he can play with fire
# Love me, Love me

# [Verse One - Pressure]
# This is recreation, set your station, and get your place in
# A comfy seat, pump this beat, Pressure will set the occasion
# For your entertainment I work hard on my flows
# This scene is full of falling MCs I wear hardhats to shows
# And every hip hop head's a critic, cos some hit the stage hard
# But couldn't get these arseholes open at a gay bar
# It's a comedy festival; they're so unintelligible
# Can't work out if they got peas for brains, or they're just vegetables
# It's sounds pathetic as me being anorexic
# I do damage like a paralytic, paramedic with no anaesthetic
# Girls shake my hand, guys want to hug me it's a worry
# If I forgot your name I'm sorry, you're probably pretty ugly
# I'm scared of getting old, so when it comes D-Day
# I'm a thank you all for dissing me, then say something clichÃ©d
# And when I'm dead and buried I want you in 'Life Be In It' shirts
# At my cemetery singing...
# Hilltop Hoods and we're coming up
# So step on up if you're dumb enough
# Hilltop Hoods and we're coming up
# So step on up if you're dumb enough
# [Verse Two - Suffa]
# People chant the chorus when they hear it, Yo it's on
# You rise like a tsunami, when you feel it; it's the bomb
# I'll make origami of your lyrics
# Geez that's good Suffa, what is it? It's a swan
# I got the shit to bomb MCs back to the Stone Age
# On stage, I'll get you out your seat quicker than road rage
# I take them all from beat jackers to backpackers
# With tracks fat as fuck, I ran amok on these wak rappers
# But then it happened. What happened? What I thought could
# I screwed all these MCs, yeah? Then it got awkward
# It got weird didn't it...
# You don't wanna see me anymore
# Oi Suffa you can't sing, yeah I can't even hum a tune
# But I make this crowd bounce like bedsprings on a honeymoon
# Come and do your best but it's still not good enough
# Suff is rough I'm with the...
# Hilltop hoods and we're coming up
# So step on up if you are dumb enough
# Hilltop hoods and we're coming up
# So step on up if you are dumb enough
# [Verse Three - Suffa & Pressure]
# From the hilltops in the Andes, to the Rockies in Canada
# We infecting mics like Tommy did Pamela
# They gassed in the head, that trash you said was pure jealousy
# Like 'Left Foot, Right Foot's an invitation to step to me
# You're loosing you footing, you need some Velcro on them Shell toes
# In fights I'm throwing rhymes, in rhyme fights I'm throwing elbows
# I move a crowd like stolen goods, so try and get a hold when
# You couldn't move your shit with a diarrhoea tic colon
# I already told them, the hills are impassable, impossible
# The truth hurts; this rhyme will put you in hospital
# Break it down like a molecule, we burning like fossil fuel
# I'm something of a phenomenon - I'm phenomenal
# These rappers they don't wanna fuck with Suff
# You better turn off your mic, unless you're dumb enough
# Cos we're running up on stage from night until the sun is up
# So run amok you're with the...

# I once had time on my hands, but now handling time
# Is coping with this life cycle and the mandatory grind
# My sanity's fine, just falling short of stamina I'm
# Searching for some food for thought to feed this famine of mind
# And when I'm stagnant I rhyme, it helps the night turn to day
# I churn my way through this nine to five and urban decay
# Believe me it's bleak, and though the city's breaths in its sleep
# It's just a paddock, ain't no where a shepherds leading these sheep
# Now most prefer it covered up lie than the truth naked
# The truth is ugly like cellulite; please don't publicly parade it
# I hate it but to escape it would be luck on fluke
# I feel like I'm a dope beat but I'm stuck on loop
# But that's my life cycle; freedom means everything to me
# And face value's got us believing everything we see
# So if our eyes tell us lies the truth is we're blind
# So keep on walking straight and narrow down illusionary lines
# [Verse Two - Pressure]
# I once had respect for this game, but now this game of respect
# Is sold to the highest bidder with some fame and a cheque
# Now any layman can get respect without breaking his neck
# Paying dues, time these crews started paying some debt
# It ain't lights and cameras, personalities on set
# Distorting realities in their context
# With no originality concepts
# Who gives a fuck about a salary; this ain't a popularity contest
# Cos hip hop ain't faking for ends
# Hip-hop ain't fading with trends
# It ain't rich kids playing with pens
# It ain't the clothes on your back, or the label on them
# It's where you're at, so I say it again
# It's just my life cycle; music means everything to me
# It's just a fashion show, nah; don't believe everything you see
# Cos if our eyes tell us lies the truth is we're blind
# So keep on walking straight and narrow down illusionary lines
# [Verse Three - Pressure]
# That's just my life cycle, nothing matters but setting me free
# Because my freedom and hip hop be meaning everything to me
# Now face values and fashions empower everything we be
# Believing everything we hear, and everything we see
# So if our eyes tell us lies, then we usually find
# Our visions cluttered by this scutter so the truth is we're blind
# It's just poison food for thought for these dillusionary minds
# So stop walking straight and narrow down illusionary

# [Verse One - Suffa]
# I gave birth to half these styles, you should pay me rhyme support
# Like Billy Jean suing Michael Jackson for child support
# Rhyme is thought, what is it? Lethal, Damn you'll get hurt
# Cos I XL like the tag on my shirt
# I'll have these rappers easing back, rhyme with a swagger
# Feed your girl aphrodisiacs and hide your viagra
# If pain was diabetes, rhyme would be my insulin
# I'm taking out the insolent in an instant when
# They bring the rhyme I'll battle if you wanna tussle
# A single line can turn that fatty matter into muscle
# You stagnate, while my rhymes circulate like rumours
# Your living proof that god has a sense of humour
# I'm butter made from the cream that came from the crop
# I'll move the mountain to Mohammed scream my name from the top
# And proclaim what I got, boy, so give me headroom
# These clubs are full of more toys than spoilt kids bedrooms
# When I'm on stage I might lose my breath
# Cos I got so much heart that there's no room in my chest
# Left for lungs, yes the bests yet
# To come, my rhymes like a hand around your neck
# Constricting your breathing like snakebites and beestings
# I'm all up in these arseholes faces like G-Strings
# I searched the world for opposition but I fear the
# Only competition I found was in a mirror
# [Verse Two - Pressure]
# When Pressure steps to the batters plate you salivate, known to captivate
# I have to break new barriers like when a chaste nun masturbates
# If one more critic asks me what I do, I'll slap them mate
# And tell them I'm a rapper as I strap her up in gaffer tape
# Loudmouths make me wanna flip
# MCs only dream they got a grip, and wake up with their hand on their dick
# Honest, if they ride the nuts I tell the get off me
# Cos I'm unstable like a cradle bridge, so don't cross me
# I'm highly explosive you're a child playing with matches
# I break rappers you give hairline fractures
# These actors keep it real? You're really wak it's fact
# You spit one-liners while I spit the finest chapters
# Perhaps it's time to retire the mic
# Like the Bulls should have done son, cos no-one wants to be like
# That anymore, cos nowadays you're taken on a fantasy tour
# Of coke, guns and gold when they're actually poor
# Factually flawed, yet entertaining
# I guess it how far we're willing to go to satisfy a craving
# Make them swallow their tongues like epileptics
# Then I'll respect it, I come clean as if my lube was antiseptic
# So blow me, you still couldn't rhyme fresh
# I'm on a higher level of divineness, so call me your highness
# There's only three things that are certain in life
# Death, taxes and Hilltop Hoods working the mic

# I be the microphone felon, tell them your master design
# It all started when I was young fiending for mics
# Dreaming of heights that I would be reaching despite
# No one would put me on, or even play me at that
# So earned my dues ganking mics labelled radio shack
# At open mic one night far from sober or with it
# This guy pulls me off and says 'You're rhyming over the limit
# And heading that way you won't last a day or a night
# You need to be down for the long haul kid we call 'em lifers
# Beside you need to stick with me cos rhyme pays
# And I know this heist where we can jack some sine waves
# They're mainly small timers, freestylers
# Street urchins and beat merchants, none of them real rhymers
# They're raping this culture and make me sick to my stomach
# These fools need to be arrested for sleeping in public'
# I dug it, got serious and mastered my rhyme
# The rocked to the spot with my new partner in crime
# Trespassed on stage, stole the mic to further insult
# Committed arsony, defamation and verbal assault
# They tried to blame the engineer oblivious to our ploy
# So we crept backstage as they buried the sound boy
# I stole the DJs crates and his diamond needles
# Now they got me on the run so it's time to leave ya'll
# We tried to cross the border, got cause as a noun carrier
# Pulled over and evicted for breaking the sound barrier
# This cop threw me to the ground, cos hip hop is violent
# Said 'You got freedom of speech, just choose to remain silent'
# Then he checked in the trunk and he found the hot sound

# [Verse One - Suffa]
# We found this club on a side street, but I was kind of iffy
# We could hear some fly beats, but from outside it looked shifty
# I said this to pressure just before I finished my sentence
# This bouncer came out and dragged us both through the entrance
# This guy was huge and I was stumbling with my speech
# I finally mumbled that we just stumbled in from the street
# He said to us "So finding us was accidental?
# Well I'm not surprised, we don't advertise at the Sentinel"
# He said "What's your name?" he said "Pressure", I said "Suffa"
# He said "Join the rest of the suckers"
# So we went right in, we sat right down
# Pressure said "I guess I'll get us both our first round"
# He had to go downstairs cos the bar was underground
# He came back and said "Man these the cheapest drinks in town"
# I agreed, yes indeed, we could be here all night
# They're only charging a buck fifty for imperial pints
# And I'm feeling alright, this place is kind of cool man
# I'm hoping tonight, nobody acts the fool and
# Ruins this vibe that I've got going
# Not knowing where I am, but this jam's growing man this spots blowing
# The ladies were hot I sat down and listened
# To their four thousand watt, in-house sound system
# The DJ was laying tracks, keeping people on the floor and then
# He played a crazy break, and the chorus went...
# [Verse Two - Pressure]
# These dim lights hold, silhouetted figures fit in tight moulds
# This beer's ice cold, yeah we're going to be here till the nights old
# I might stroll, see what I can plunder, but I wonder
# Do I feel a blunder or is that the drink putting me under
# A strange feeling, this place got my brain reeling
# Looked up and seen a picture of the barkeep upon the main ceiling
# Feels like a broken dream, I'm walking through a smoke machine and
# In the corner seen a dope fiend, blowing a smoke screen
# Sat down, looked at the picture on the bottle label
# It was the same man and the stripper that sat atop my table
# And as he licked her thighs I saw that glint in her eyes
# The wristwatch upon her waistlet it had him hypnotized
# She kissed him goodbye, threw me a smile and a grin
# My reply cut thin by my hand wiping my chin
# Walked to the bar as the tender looked right through me I said
# "Excuse me", then he replied in tones as if he talked about me not to me
# He said: "Welcome to the Sentinel, I hope your stay here's perpetual
# We serve drinks and broken dreams but no edibles"
# I bought a round, man I think this is watered down
# Its tasting sought of fowl
# This place is giving me the creeps and plus the doors are now
# Closing to the public so let's make our move
# Then I was struck by the strangest sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu
# Man I swore I was bent "Suffa man I've heard this all before it went"
# Ba ba ba ba ba, and then the chorus went...
# [Verse Three - Pressure & Suffa]
# Man this place's got me reeling I took a seat to get my focus
# When a group of B-Boys gathered by the stage took my notice
# At about one o'clock, the club manager approached us
# And said "I heard you jokers were MCs, who's the dopest?
# Cos we run an open mic battle every night
# And to enter you've got to be, incredibly tight"
# I said "Get me the mic I might flip", then the lights switched
# My vision was blurring and burning words inside my eyelids
# Rhyme progression begun, something possessing my tongue
# Blessing the deaf and dumb till I was falling short of breath in my lung
# "When will they let us stop?" I checked the time and it was
# Six in the morning, and we were still rhyming
# Battled MC after MC, battled MCs for days
# But they wouldn't let us go, when we tried to leave the stage
# The manager said "You boys can never leave this tournament
# And you can never leave the Sentinel", and the chorus went...
> Hilltop Hoods
# You won't get far little punk cos I bust pure rhymes
# I tear up bars like a drunk on a bus tour I'm
# The hideous, insidious, super fly Suffa
# Ignorance is bliss and you're a happy motherfucker
# Sucker rock a set, I'm like Bobba Fett with intellect
# I'm everywhere you go like porno on the Internet
# So you don't wanna step, trust me, you been warned
# You don't wanna play leapfrog with a unicorn
# Leave you torn, you couldn't battle me with that lame rhyme
# You couldn't come hard with two women at the same time
# You walk in the club dipped in jewels and versace
# Only gay guys wear that much gold, ask Liberace
# MCs act arrogant, I wonder why
# If your skills matched your ego you'd be eating humble pie
# Your rhymes are more average than your girlfriend's looks
# And with a face like that, I hope that girl can cook, it's like that

# [Verse One - Suffa]
# Let me introduce myself, raise them beers
# Suffa MC, been doing this for more than ten years
# Ever since I was a youngster, I brought the funk for
# The love, and for the party people to get drunk to
# Since back in the day we've been the major crew
# When I step on the stage it's like De Ja Vu
# Years of performing, years of practice
# Respect from my peers, my girls tears on the mattress
# Every time that we went on tour
# And she was left behind feeling insecure
# But she needn't worry; I wasn't chasing a girl to rock right
# I was chasing the warm glow of a spotlight
# City after city, state to state
# We were just three mates rocking beats and breaks
# So if you made it to a Hoods show to check the style
# You get much respect, you made it all worthwhile
# [Verse Two - Pressure]
# Let me introduce myself, raise them beers
# Pressure MC, been doing this for more than ten years
# It's been a long road I'm glad I stayed on track
# A dream of making raps, and getting played on wax
# It seems that faking jacks want to cause my demise
# Along the way wouldn't give me play but couldn't stop the course of my rise
# Now of course the sky's the limit, we fly get with it
# You ain't underground, that's because you dig it
# It took infinite skills and hard work to get this far jerk
# Look me in the face, now I'm the one who wears a smart smirk
# It wasn't all negative, took the good with the bad
# Us falling off will never happen, like catching the Hoods in drag
# In an orderly fashion I'm thanking those who supported me
# Wouldn't be where I'm standing if they hadn't have fought for me
# From a nothing rep, now we live busting sets
# So if you own a Hoods album you get nuff respect
# [Verse Three - Suffa]
# Let me introduce myself, raise them beers
# Suffa MC, been doing this for more than ten years
# We've been through a lot to perfect this art
# When Next left the group it near broke my heart
# But then Debris stepped up as the DJ
# A super team spearheaded by PJ
# Chasing dreams like Fats chasing punani
# It's all about the culture, never been about the money
# But we had to watch people trying to take advantage
# Of us, trying to damn near rob us
# We got slowed down by dodgy contract offers
# But it would take a nation of millions to stop us
# We got our propers, paid our dues in triplicate
# Ripping it, till other crews were insignificant
# I've stayed true, never made myself a hypocrite
# Trust me, I'm wise I got the certificate
# [Verse Four - Pressure]
# Let me introduce myself, raise them beers
# Pressure MC, been doing this for more than ten years
# Yeah we made it far, through beats pumping and flows
# My bro Rated R props for being the drunkest at shows
# And support from my mates who fought for the stakes
# Of Oz hip-hop, props to record stores, I bought from their crates
# You see talking it takes less than walking the stakes
# So put your money where your mouth is and stop flaunting as fakes
# For those who stuck by me over time I put yours over mine
# Don't have to speak your names you know my mind
# In this simple game of respect it's given as it's taken
# Been given props, now respected tracks is what I'm making
# Shouts to everyone I met on tour
# It's our hip hop ladies and gentlemen let's keep it pure
# So here's another LP from the Hoods to crank to
# Hope you dig the rest of this album people I got to thank you

# The certified have arrived, extraordinaire extravagant
# Beers like confidence, man I'm drinkin' until I'm arrogant
# Cause I'm a cocky fuck, Hit your girl and I knock her up
# Girly what the fuck? In the net like a hockey puck. (score!)
# Rappers get embarrassed when they see the way that we work
# They try hard to (sherm) like fat guys swimming in T-shirts
# Research your Oz hip-hop, before you step to us
# And if you step, hands around your throat like a necklace
# Missed the drum, young ladies gimme a call
# My number's written next to Fuckwit on the Chicks bathroom wall
# I'm slightly easy and a try bit sleazy
# With a wood of a red brick and chiselled body of Kim Beazley
# My theory is, never touch the mic quite serious
# A kid goes out on dates later than their next period
# My crews got it made, rockin the place
# With more dope rappers to match every branch here to colonnade
# It's Certified Wise, no need to tell you again
# Because these cunts can be so funky that the smell would offend
# A dyke's girlfriend dog, now lets get straight to the point shall we
# This rowdy crowd of MC's and DJ's know how to pound beats
# Like kids with flat feet and crap beats walking down backstreets
# So much work went into this to line the notes of fact sheets
# Like black sheep I've got two words for those who slept
# (nya, Nya nya nyoooo)
# You thought it was safe, well guess what (what?)
# Boys then beware; my friends will find your weak points (then what)
# Get up in there.
# Attack your mind, with a fine line when I find time
# And I'll find out that you're walking if you're talking the grape vine
# I'll waste time. Need to take on the job at hand.
# The skills for this professional typical certified wise man
# From Skybelleland, I'm becoming all your seeds and plants
# So take cover as I rave under a Laundromat
# Every songs a collection of kids charmed lives

# This is for the heads that's loving the mix
# My people in the front, all covered in spit
# Batters in the box, Suffa to pitch
# Hilltop Hoods, all up in this bitch
# And we the funk leaders, punks you can't beat us
# We bump and pump meters, we drunk you chumps need us
# So jump with us, down in the front if it's
# Your flavour, come get drunk with us
# This life turned out nothing like
# I had planned, why not?
# By now I should've had some land
# Some money in my hand, round about fifty grand
# But I got nothing, I write rhymes on the bus
# I keep suffering; fuck the lines of the dust
# You keep sniffing, that shit is for the punk hoes
# This shit is for my bros, my people in the front row
# [Verse Two - Suffa]
# I got hip-hop taste buds
# I wanna hear that bass when I make love
# I wanna hear some lyrics when I wake up
# Write rhymes to get me through a break up, bitch!
# Rough like whisky straight, no chaser
# Went through fifty breaks, no flavour
# Till I found this one, and made the
# Bass hook with the drum, my saviour
# This is the comeback, tongue that's sharp like a thumbtack
# It's so tight James is saying give my funk back
# One track, eight track, a-dat, residual
# Noise, man fuck that, we clean with the digital
# Toys I'm the Apache, you're failing to match me
# Throw your hands in the air like you're hailing a taxi
# And move to the funk flow, you stepping? Are you drunk bro?
# This is for my peeps and the freaks in the front row
# [Verse Three - Suffa]
# People don't complain if Suffa's in here
# And you're in the front row, all covered in beer
# And club owners don't say 'the place is wrecked it's your fault'
# If the roof is on fire it's an electrical fault
# Man I bet you all bolt, when I bring it live
# Like Friday night footy, in my hoody can hide I
# Gets live on the breaks son, like pace one
# Lads, if you're heading to the bar grab your mates one
# Ladies come chill, come rock with me honey
# I got like half a mill in monopoly money
# There's no stopping me honey, so you can take my hand
# We can lay on the beach and count grains of sand
# Or take a plane to Japan, and drink saki with mafia
# Fly to Libya for some Bacardi with Gadafi a
# Dinner date, followed by a funk show
# We'll rip off our tops and jump around in the front row

# [Verse One - Pressure]
# Be careful what you wish for; be cautious what you seek
# Women are like opportunities; grasp them when they're in reach
# All that glitters is gold, and sold for green locally
# Life's a blind struggle that's why fate keeps tripping over me
# With fines, debts and warrants trust me when I say they serve you
# What you don't know can't hurt you; so not knowing you's a virtue
# It's a fast food world; I fear that I'm a die gluttoning
# But life is like John Howard, too short to waste time worrying
# I moved from my parentals, used to lose it in the mental
# Now I'm using my potential, for bruising instrumentals
# I'm a bad natured human, bound to stagnate in ruin
# Till these man made delusions catch a bad case of bruising
# We're all drunk philosophers so give it time now
# There's a fine line between a smile and a frown, Yeah? It's called an eyebrow
# If measurement of ones worth was one word of testament
# I'm done keeping it real I keep it relevant
# Life is a road, full of turn-offs, short sprints and long runs
# We'll deal with it as it comes
# If I lose my way I'll follow you
# Cos today's like yesterday I guess tomorrow will do
# Life is a road, full of turn-offs, short sprints and long runs
# We'll deal with it as it comes
# If I lose my way I'll follow you
# Cos today's like yesterday I guess tomorrow will do
# [Verse Two - Suffa]
# I've been an out and out loudmouth since my youth
# I'm generous with words but selfish with the truth
# I'd never say some things on my mind anyway
# Cos ideas are like cars, they get stolen everyday
# And when I do speak women call me a creep
# Ladies chivalry's not dead it's on the couch where you made it sleep
# I get deep without the meaningful
# Mimed a rhyme to a blind man, he said 'Boy now I've seen it all'
# The worlds an ugly place filled with beautiful women
# And people, who love music but lack suitable rhythm
# What a computer will give them an instrument won't
# It's called hip hop, guess what we're the industry joke
# But hip hop followers, follow us till your sorrow is gone
# And be strong cos tomorrow it's on
# We ain't no beat nick, weak trip, kids on the sneak tip
# We spit deep shit all of life' secrets

# [Verse One - Suffa]
# I speak from the heart, but only when I drink
# And I only ever sleep when I'm too tired to think
# Restlessness, the reaction that you will find
# From stress I guess and having a compassionate mind
# I worry bout the machine of progress, ain't no stopping it
# The forest we destroy and the world we build on top of it
# Mercenaries get paid salaries to slaughter
# Girls obsessed with body image find calories in water
# Nurses comfort seven-year-old casualties of mortar
# A peasant's daughter caught up in a war for a border
# And at home we treat our refugees like criminals
# Detention centres just a catch phrase for a minimal
# Security prison, we drive gold trimmed cars
# Down the road an Afghani kid grows up behind bars
# And we wonder why they hate the west
# When we treat them like they're second-class citizens at best
# We're all pawns in a game, the USAs miniatures
# Aussie foreign policy with George Bush's signature
# Peeps die for a watch and blue chip stock
# Did they do Big Pop or was it two bit cops
# I wanna sue kid rock for making rednecks think they're hip hop
# Wanna swallow people's pain and spit it from the hilltop
# Wanna affect change in the subjects that we talk on
# Connect strangers, work together and walk on
# [Verse Two - Pressure]
# Polluting airways, mankind strays with no reforming
# So slap on that sunscreen and enjoy the global warming
# Cos ignoring world issues is what we all do best
# Just like Aussie politicians shoe shining for the U.S
# To save losing face, no thoughts to the fumes that trace
# Our sky lines and clogs our seas we swimming in consumer waste
# The fumes of hate rise globally but will it cease
# The day we try and find a little peace within the Middle East
# We shadow their borders yelling deplete their arms
# Its just war for black gold so they can grease their palms
# We all need a scapegoat, a villain to cop blame
# We're just wolves in sheep's clothing killing in gods name
# And that's world wide, like global over population
# We mine the world dry of natural resources to feed our nations
# Appetite for waste, I see it everywhere
# I feel like throwing a flag of protest in Tienanmen Square
# We need to care for mother earth and all of her natural defences
# But talk is cheap, and taking action is expensive
# We wear our hearts on our sleeves, our flags on our borders
# And that's why nuclear testings done in pacific foreign waters
# We follow reporters with the worth of a scholar
# And gather personal opinions from a rag worth a dollar
# Man this is not a subject I feel lightly I can talk on
# The attitude is one man of many, so walk on

# And bleed the wine unholy

# And fear nothing
# In the nightside of Eden
# We're born again dead
# Forever we are
# Forever we've been
# Forever we'll be crucified to a dream
# In the nightside of Eden

# Learning the mathematics of evil by heart

# Kada je vani mračan dan
# Dan prikovan za prozore

# K'o da je ljeto bilo san
# Ulaziš mi u svijet kao vatromet
# I daješ svemu neki smisao i ime
# Strah me da nas ne stigne

# A ti mi kažeš:»Ma ne brini se,
# Navuci zastore, isključi svijet
# Barem za nas»

# Ili ćemo usahnuti

# Only dance with me when it's sunny
# If you could me mine then I will be your honeyz

# The things we want and the things we need
# Can be two different things
# Instead of the same
# When we hold on to what's dear to us
# When it don't belong to us
# Who is to blame?
# And when we think we get a little closer
# We'll just be pushing away
# And when we force it
# It's when it ends up breaking
# You know things just work that way
# (Sometimes) sometimes things just won't change
# Until we can learn to give
# To give it away
# Just let it go
# Sometimes things just won't move
# Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
# Until we can prove that we
# Can let it alone
# Just let it go
# If we compromise who we are
# What makes us think we'd get that far
# Rolling that way (yeah)
# Then finally we'll wake up and we'd realise
# Everyone that we despise
# We used to embrace
# Just when we think we, get a little stronger
# That's when we're weakest of all
# We think we're holding onto something special
# That very thing makes us fall
# (Sometimes) sometimes things just won't change
# Sometimes, sometimes
# Until we can learn to give (oh, yeah)
# To give it away
# Just let it go
# Sometimes things just won't move
# Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
# Until we can prove that we
# Can let it alone
# Just let it go, oh yeah
# Just let it go

# Wishing you would come to me and leave me never
# Last night involved (last night involved)
# In having mutual attraction
# We've got everything (we've got everything)
# To live for boy
# I'll find a way (I'll find a way)
# Maybe today
# Hear what I say
# It seems like I can't hide
# (It seems I can't hide)
# The way I feel inside
# (The way I feel inside)
# And I just wanna say
# (And I just wanna say)
# Hello, hello, hello
# The thing that we could do
# If we were all alone together
# I like to make you scream
# You and me in ecstasy
# Boy, forever
# It's such a shame
# (Oh, such a shame)
# To think that you will never know
# About this love that I've been saving, boy
# I'll find a way
# (I will find a way)
# Maybe today
# Hear what I say
# It seems like I can't hide
# (It seems I can't hide)
# The way I feel inside
# (The way I feel inside)
# And I just wanna say
# (And I just wanna say)
# Hello, hello, hello
# It seems like I can't hide
# (It seems I can't hide)
# The way I feel inside
# (The way I feel)
# And I just wanna say
# (And I just wanna say)
# Hello, hello, hello
# There's nothing wrong
# (Oh, there's nothing wrong)
# In having mutual attraction
# We've got everything (we've got everything)
# To live for boy
# I'll find a way
# (I will find a way)
# Maybe today
# Hear what I say
# It seems like I can't hide
# (It seems I can't hide)
# The way I feel inside

# Hello, hello, hello
# Don't wanna hide it
# Cause I can't fight it
# Don't wanna hide it
# No, no, no, no, no.
# Don't wanna hide it
# Cause I can't fight it

# (Ring, ring)
# Hey, this is a message for the Honeyz
# Barry here
# There's gonna be some sexy things on the album
# You know what I'm saying?
# So, you tell me later, just give me a call
# Okay, peace. I'm out
# Bye, baby
# Each day I pray
# For love to come my way
# And I'm still here looking
# But not knowing where to find you
# So I ask myself
# Besoin d'aimée
# Besoin d'été aimée
# I've been waiting for so very long
# To find someone that I could call my own
# But I know that one day
# I'll find the perfect love
# The kind of love that every girl prays for
# Sometimes I feel like I'm all alone
# (But I'm strong)
# So I keep holding on
# 'Til I find a love of my life
# (I need somebody to love me)
# Someone to love me
# (To love me)
# For the rest of my life
# (Sometimes when days get so lonely)
# I need someone to hold me
# (To love me)
# Who'll make it all right
# Some people wonder how a girl like me
# Could even know the meaning of love
# (Meaning of love)
# I may be young, but I've been around
# And yes, I know
# That I've had my ups and my downs.
# I need someone
# Who will stay with me
# Till the end
# So please tell me when
# Will I find that special friend?
# (I need somebody to love me)
# Someone to love me
# (To love me)
# For the rest of my life
# (Sometimes when days get so lonely)
# I need someone to hold me
# (To love me)
# Who'll make it all right
# Every Juliet needs a Ro-Romeo
# (Romeo)
# Someone who'll be there and never let go
# (Never let go)
# He may be near or he may be far
# I don't know
# Until he's here
# I wish on a star
# (Star)
# Oh oh oh...
# (I need somebody to love me)
# Someone to love me
# (To love me)
# For the rest of my life
# Sometimes when days get so lonely
# I need someone to hold me
# (To love me)
# Who'll make it all right
# (Somebody to love me)
# (Somebody to need me)
# I need someone to love me
# (To love me for the rest of my life)
# For the rest of my life
# (Sometimes when days get so lonely)
# Sometimes when days get so lonely
# (To love me for the rest of my life)
# I need someone to love me
# (I need somebody to love me)
# I need someone to love me
# (To love me for the rest of my life)
# Ooh, for the rest of my life
# (Sometimes when days get so lonely)
# Sometimes when days get so lonely
# (To love me)
# (Who'll make it all right)
# Who'll make it all right
# (Somebody to love me)
# (Somebody to need me)

# Pulled from seclusion, dragged out of our room
# This construction is perfectly obstructing our view
# Paired up and placed back on to our path
# Compress in this space that frames an awkward act
# The chance to make it last has come and gone
# Glass shatters with an unsteady grip
# No chance to catch the blood as it comes rushing in
# Too quickly pumping out from the inside
# Dripping into patterns strewn across my thigh
# Each drop spreads and spells a passage
# Soon I'll reclaim this dull history
# The seamstress weaves shut the stitches
# But re-opens the same memory
# Two years have passed and nothings changed, that's alright
# Still you just wait for that embrace, it's alright
# There is only one thing that has yet to be said, I am holding back
# There is only one thing that has yet to be said, I'm holding back
# Doesn't matter there's no reason to persist
# While avoiding all but that kiss
# Scraping cheeks with your passionless lips
# From your side of things it's not quite over with
# I don't think that you warrant anything else but the truth
# Sorry, this time I've out done it
# Cause I know that, I know that you'll lose
# I don't think that she noticed that there was anything wrong at all
# Finally I'm free to leave
# I don't ever really want to pull and push again unless you're gonna fall

# If you want, if you want to be the one that he's thinking of
# You just need to understand
# Just turn around

# Oh-oh
# You are the only thing, the only thing that he has left
# The only thing at all, the only thing at all
# In later hours when the packed bars start spitting cowards
# They're picking scars
# Cell phones clenched along the sidewalk
# They usually stay out of our way
# The bridge and tunnel just seems to escape near our home

# When I said you looked good baby

# We could head back to your crib

# Even though I'm seeing three of your faces
# Please, God, let's not resort to mini-mall parking spaces
# Encounters with police, with my hands in the air
# Encounters with police
# Why ask if you don't care
# I just had no idea that this would be lasting for just one single moment
# I just have to say, you look so goddamn good
# I give you crazy mad props, because I know I should
# OK, I'm a bit intoxicated, but really I just graduated
# And from where my hands are situated
# Obviously, I'm growing more and more infatuated
# Just wait, please wait
# We could be like onions and peppers
# In a sleeping bag fajita
# We could be anything you want
# The way you're busting out of that wife-beater
# And I know it's a bit uncomfortable here in this 2-door seater
# But you're just the right size,
# And I will always feed you and feed you and feed you
# If you were driving next to me
# Say, on the LIE
# My eyes would become so engaged

# Into the HOV

# So you regret the last five years of your life with me
# Don't you think that I feel the same way too?
# Don't you think that I feel the same way too?
# Disengage your eyes
# At least one moment in time
# And soon you will know
# Trace the lines on my face
# Until you are underneath
# It all starts real slow
# Walking sleepless through these streets
# I don't understand a thing you mean
# This relationship is based on what trails across the CD case
# And it will all soon come to an end
# But if you don't pick up the phone, you will regret it
# I've said it before, but this time I mean it
# You, you keep telling me that you regret
# All the things that we've done
# I've tortured you, that I'm willing to admit
# Guilt-ridden for those years
# Trying to forget, from now on

# In my bed for six long months
# February, Valentines Day
# Did my best to avoid the red cliches
# So you dumped me on the subway
# On my way to work at 9 in the morning
# Everybody else is holding bouquets
# Now I'm holding my face in the basement
# Scratching away for any trace
# Of affection you will leave
# Falling victim as the publics prey

# With pressure and squeeze, from points underneath
# The streams in your skin are ready
# And I can, so I will, just as long as you instill
# This fear in my heart
# I just hope that you aren't alone
# 'Did I do something wrong?' her eyes start to question
# Yes, you did something wrong.

# The blistering that carved that shape in you all night
# With your chin down to your chest

# Can you look at yourself and feel proud of all the things you've done?
# Did you inspire the ones that you knew?
# Make a difference to those who knew you?
# Did you finally figure out what it is that makes us who we are today?
# Don't waste another day
# You never know when you'll get one
# Don't waste another day
# To do anything you haven't done
# Did you always give it your best?
# Is there anything you regret?
# If you could have another shot at it all,
# Would you do it just the same?
# Was it all that you thought it could be?
# Are you the person you thought you would be?
# Or did it feel like you were spinning your wheels,
# Instead of moving forward everyday?
# [Chorus (2x)]
# Don't waste another day
# You never know when you'll get one
# Don't waste another day
# To do anything you haven't done
# Did you?
# [Chorus (2x)]
# Don't waste another day
# You never know when you'll get one
# Don't waste another day
# To do anything you haven't done

# There's a pain that sleeps inside
# It sleeps with just one eye
# And awakens the moment that you're near
# Though I try to look away
# The pain it still remains
# Only leaving when you're next to me
# Do you know, that everytime you're near
# Everybody else seems far away
# So can you come and make them disappear
# Make them disappear and we can stay
# So I stand and look around
# Distracted by the sounds
# Of everyone and everything I see
# And I search through every face
# Without a single trace, of the person
# The person that I need
# Do you know, that everytime you're near
# Everybody else seems far away
# So can you come and make them disappear
# Make them disappear and we can stay
# Can you make them disappear?
# Make them disappear
# There's a pain that sleeps inside
# Sleeps with just one eye
# And awakens, the moment that you're near
# And I search through every face
# Without a single trace, of the person
# The person that I need
# Do you know, that everytime you're near
# Everybody else seems far away
# So can you come and make them disappear
# Make them disappear and we can stay

# Another day goes without any change
# The feeling we live with still remains
# We're stuck in a hole and we're searching for anything to hold onto
# There has to be somewhere that we can be safe from the lives we live each day
# There has to be somewhere that we can be far away...
# We have to escape and I will go anywhere if you just lead the way
# Escape to a place where we'll be together, together everyday
# We have to escape....
# We could living how we wanted to
# Instead of doing things we're forced to do
# With no one to tell us that we should be going throughwhat they went through
# There has to be some place that nobody knows, somewhere we can only go
# There has to be some place that we can be all alone....
# We have to escape...

# There was a time when our dreams felt so real
# Just out of reach but not too far to feel
# Together we'd finally make then come true
# 'Cause anythings possible when i was with you
# But they kept on saying we'd never amount to anything....
# All of the dreams we built up from the ground
# They never believed them they just tore them down
# We will rebuild them from the start, we will rebuild them from the heart
# 'Cause once all we wanted seemed so far away
# But with everystep it was closer each day
# The more that we tried it was within our grasp
# The more that they told us that it wouldn't last
# And everyone said we were crazy for giving up everything....

# Saw you last night
# you were sleeping in my mind
# Doubting you'll ever be free again
# Then I climbed back inside
# Someone open my eyes
# To find me drunk again
# Bonnie on the radio
# And she was singing low "Give it up or let me go"
# Every night there is one more
# Every night there is two more
# Saying I shouldn't be feeling this pain
# I think I better grow up now or go insane
# There's so much I feel
# So much I conceal
# There's just so many things I can be
# Someone write the story of 5 points
# No one wanted to know me
# Now they all have opinions of what we do
# So they go down to Bar None so we can have a drink or two
# Can't write a story from the trees
# I know somewhere she's watching me
# Saying "Boy carry your load"
# Oh I don't want to go back on the road now
# There's so much I feel
# So much I conceal
# There's just so many places to see
# And faces I can read
# There's just so many things I can beEnd of buffer

# Tomorrow used to be a day away
# Now love is gone and you're into someone far away
# I never thought the day would come
# When I would see his hand not mine
# Holding on to yours because I could not
# Find the time
# And now I can't deny
# Nothing lasts forever
# But I don't wanna leave and see the teardrops in your eyes
# I dont wanna live to see the day we say goodbye
# Now there comes another fallen life
# I come alone
# Sitting at a bar with Chris that I can't leave cause my house ain't no home
# I just wanna touch you girl
# I wanna feel you close to me
# Without your love I would give up now
# And walk away so easily
# So baby why break up
# We'll figure out together
# That even with the pain there's a remedy
# We'll be allright
# I don't wanna live to see the day we say goodbye
# When i first me you I couldn't love anyone
# But you stole my dreams and you made me see that
# I can walk into the sun and I could still be me
# And now i can't deny
# Nothing lasts forever
# But I don't wanna leave and see the teardrops in your eyes
# So baby why break up
# Lets figure out together
# That even with the pain there's a remedy, and
# We'll be alright
# I don't wanna live to see the day we say goodbye
# We say goodbye
# Oh goodbye
> Hootie and the Blowfish
# You've got your big girls
# Now you have your young one too
# Wonder if someday I can have them
# The way I once had you
# I remember your crazy remarks
# We'd get drunk and go out after dark
# Searching for someone we could take home
# chorus:
# You don't wanna be alone
# You don't wanna see the sun go down
# You don't wanna open the door
# And see her go
# One step and tomorrow comes
# Two steps and she's off with someone
# Three steps and it's all you know
# You'll be gone, she'll be gone
# So what are you gonna do about me?
# I'll be there when you have no one else
# Spot in the ocean in the south's holy land
# I'll be there, be your friend
# Hold on strong, don't let go
# There'll never be no one to take your place
# So don't you wanna reach out and take my hand

# Mama, please don't go
# Won't you stay here for one more day
# I've been your boy for so long now
# There's so much I, I still have to say
# The sky ripped open and I held my heart in my hand
# Like a soldier on his very last day
# Cried myself to sleep that night
# And I listened as I heard the angels sing
# Sha la la
# chorus:
# Sha la la la,
# La la la la
# I'm goin' home

# Something inside of me makes me scream
# How could God take you from a little boy
# You'll be alright he's by my side
# He's not a little boy, he's my pride and joy
# (chorus)
# Summer on the radio, when the phone rang
# And it was Jeanette
# Saying boy we had to let her go
# I beg, "No, no not yet"
# You left six of us to fend for ourselves
# Guess it's just part of someone's master plan
# We'll say you left cause you're my best friend
# You were a liar then, and that's my plan
# The angels sing...
# (chorus)
> Hootie and the Blowfish
# Could we do it again
# If he asked how it felt
# And I didn't say this time
# You tried to scare me with empty thoughts
# That means not a thing
# 'Cause I'm down behind you
# Could we swing it again
# If I changed how he looked
# And turned to the right to bend
# You live with something that I can't explain
# But your face cracks a smile when you see it shining
# You feel things in your own way
# And I'm supposed to lay down and bow to you
# I'm tired of bailing hay for something that I can't see
# I don't want to be you
# You don't want to be me.
# Just let it breathe
# If the moon goes up tomorrow and I'm down on a farm
# And you don't believe whose writing with me
# Keep your hands to yourself
# Keep your mind to yourself
# Keep your breath to yourself
# Let me float on by you
# You see things in your own way
# And I'm supposed to lay down and bow to you
# I'm tired of bailing hay for something that I can't see
# You don't want to be me
# I don't want to be you
# It's so very necessary
# It's so delectable to see a stone
# It's so impossible to find a reason
# When you're standing there
# Watching me now
# Could we live it again
# If we dressed just the same
# And held on to lovers when
# We couldn't really live with anyone
# See mostly ourselves so just go on lying
# You feel things in your own way
# And I'm supposed to lay down and bow to you
# I'm tired of bailing hay for someone that I can't see

# She turns over to start a conversation
# With a man that noone else can see
# She dreams of loving me sometimes
# And it makes me see what we've been missing

# And she makes me see that they don't matter

# It's like the sun goes down and she crawls away again
# She wears white pants a Miami sweater
# Says that She loves the O's
# So Uncle Dean will come by
# Her smile is like sunshine
# Her tears hurt like leather
# She runs the show she lets me know
# Says it's all about being the only
# It's like someone said you could have one good thing in your life
# She couldn't be your type
# I didn't plan for your smile, but you make me laugh when you stand dreamin'
# I believe, we see her layin with another
# She runs around you and then
# It's like the sun goes down and she crawls away again
# Where were you yesterday
# Now that my heart is wild and free
# And my lips have room to wander
# How can I say your needing me now
# When I've got a plan
# I know you don't understand why my heart is sorry know
# I believe
# We see her laying with another

# Another reason to doubt me
# Another teardrop falls
# Can't wait for a friend when loneliness calls
# Another kiss in the basement
# Pour salt on my tongue
# No one cries for heros left unsung
# Look at me when I'm talking to you
# Look at me in the eyes
# Then look away and tell me why...why
# Another tasteless movie
# Another kiss goodnight
# Could be a dark oasis in my life
# Another icon smashed to pieces
# By yesterday's romance
# Another hated person no more chances
# Look at me when I'm talking to you
# Look at me in the eyes
# Then look away and tell me why...why
# Playin' with a happy boy
# A cold place for a man Familiar faces in a foreign land
# The hands kept spinning around the face
# But the earth stopped cold at dawn
# For a moment, then moved on
# For a moment, then moved on...

# Staring back at you
# Did you see my lips
# Or were you smiling right in front of me
# Your father called my name
# Then he smiled with great relief
# 'Cause it wasn't me that you were clinging to

# They don't know what to do
# Ever since you said goodbye to me
# And the flowers in their gloom, have just refused to bloom

# All the birds have been blue
# They don't know what to do
# Ever since you said goodbye to me
# And the flowers in their gloom, have just refused to bloom
# Cause we all want you back, you see
# And even mister moon
# Is left without a tune
# And his shadow has lost the harmony
# So don't waste any time
# Come back and change your mind
# And everything will work out
# Naturally
# You know that love is a struggle
# And only the strong survive
# So it's up to me and you
# To do what we've got to do
# To keep our love alive
# And the bees have been gone
# And they know that something's wrong
# Because they don't feel like buzzing at all
# And the starts up in the sky, all they do it cry
# And that's why the rain must fall
# And the early morning sun
# He knows that you're the one
# And we both miss your company
# So don't waste any time
# Come back and change your mind
# You know that love is a struggle
# And only the strong survive
# So it's up to me and you
# To do what we've got to do
# To keep our love alive
# So don't waste any time
# Come back and change your mind
# We'll be singing harmonies
# With the birds and bees
# If only you'll be mine
# Things will work out find

# The power of love is a curious thing
# Make a one man weep, make another man sing
# Change a hawk to a little white dove.
# More than a feeling, that's the power of love.
# Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
# Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream.
# Make a bad one good, mm, make a wrong one right.
# Power of love that keep you home at night.
# You don't need money, don't take fame.
# Don't need no credit card to ride this train.
# It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes.
# But it might just save your life.
# That's the power of love.
# That's the power of love.
# First time you fell it, it might make you sad.
# Next time you feel it, it might make you mad.
# But you'll be glad , baby when you've found
# That's the power makes the world go 'round.
# And it don't take money, don't take fame.
# Don't need no credit card to ride this train.
# It's strong and it's sudden. It can be cruel sometimes.
# But it might just save your life.
# They say that all in love is fair, yeah, but you don't care.
# But you'll know what to do when it gets hold of you.
# And with a little help from above, you feel the power of love.
# You feel the power of love.
# Can you feel it?
# Hmm.
# It don't take money, and it don't take fame.
# Don't need no credit card to ride this train.
# Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel.
# But you won't feel nothing till you feel,
# You feel the power, just feel the power of love.
# That's the power, that's the power of love.
# You feel the power of love.
# You feel the power of love.
# Feel the power of love.

# I've been living with a shadow overhead
# I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed
# I've been lonely for so long
# Trapped in the past, I just can't seem to move on
# I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away
# Just in case I ever need em again someday
# I've been setting aside time
# To clear a little space in the corners of my mind
# All I want to do is find a way back into love
# I can't make it through without a way back into love
# Oh oh oh
# I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine
# I've been searching but I just don't see the signs
# I know that it's out there
# There's got to be something for my soul somewhere
# I've been looking for someone to shed some light
# Not somebody just to get me through the night
# I could use some direction
# And I'm open to your suggestions
# All I want to do is find a way back into love
# I can't make it through without a way back into love
# And if I open my heart again
# I guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the end
# oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
# There are moments when I don't know if it's real
# Or if anybody feels the way I feel
# I need inspiration
# Not just another negotiation
# All I want to do is find a way back into love
# I can't make it through without a way back into love
# And if I open my heart to you
# I'm hoping you'll show me what to do
# And if you help me to start again
# You know that I'll be there for you in the end
# oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

# I wanna be, just where you wanna be
# I wanna be, just where you wanna be
# 7 lonely nights
# 7 lonely days
# I been thinking 'bout you girl
# In just as many ways
# Running out of money
# Running out of time
# Feeling kind of empty
# Like a cheap valentine
# Now I'm used to everything I want
# But now I will give you everything you need
# Baby I been thinking about you
# 7 lonely days are on my mind
# Baby, I really miss you
# I really miss your touch
# I wanna be, just where you wanna be
# I wanna be, just where you wanna be
# Baby, I really miss you
# I really miss your touch
# Rum and cola nights
# Melancholy days
# Stare at my reflection and the error of my ways
# Now all the kings horses
# And all of his men
# Can't stop me wishing I was holding you again
# Now I know you're everything I want
# And now I wanna give you everything you need
# (Chorus)
# 7 lonely days and lonely nights
# I been missing you
# I just want my baby by my side
# Do you miss me too
# It doesn't take a weaker man
# To need someone to hold his hand
# And to miss your touch
# I - want to be where you - want to be I do
# Want to be where you - want to be
# (Chorus)
> Human Nature
# How can I go on
# When I know I gave it all
# Have I given too much?
# Something inside your heart is pushing me aside
# And it seems so un-you baby
# But it's so hard on me
# What is it I'm seeing in your eyes?
# The story that I'm reading says goodbye
# CHORUS:
# Tell me baby where did we go wrong?
# How did we lose a love so strong?
# What can I say to make things right?
# Baby hold on - don't leave tonight
# There's no reason why this part of us should die
# Don't say goodbye
# Searching for answers
# But they're oh so hard to find
# 'Cause I'm still loving you, baby
# Oh, are you still loving me?
# Baby don't you turn and close the door
# Is it you don't love me any more?
# CHORUS
# Don't leave me now
# All alone
# Don't bring me down
# 'Cause I'm not that strong
# I need your love to carry on

# He don't love you, no¡¦.
# If I was your man
# I'd be here every day
# If I was your man
# I wouldn't treat you that way
# He's never home, he never calls
# How can you tell me he's yours
# If I was him and you were mine
# Girl you'd know it for sure
# If you were my girl
# I'd give you it all
# Why can't you see he's faking
# Chorus
# He don't love you, no.
# But he don't want anyone else to have you
# He don't wanna let go
# So baby tell me why you
# Let him treat you so
# When I would do anything to have you
# Make your mind up
# What you wanna do
# He don't love you, no
# Oh t-t-t-t-tell me Do you know his friends
# Girl do you know the score
# Don't you think it's strange
# They don't know who you are
# He takes you out to somewhere new
# Then he leaves you alone
# And if you talk to anyone
# Then he tells you to go
# You forgive him then
# He does it again
# Tell me how long will you take it

# If I only had the heart to tell you the way it is

# So many reasons why
# You should know that I'd
# Never go behind you and make you cry
# Don't you throw this man

# Yesterdays - been and gone
# When we were young
# Remember when
# We started out as friends
# We were one and the same
# Don't even think that I knew your name
# That was then
# So many things have changed
# But looking back on the days
# It's good to see that we are still the same
# Sometimes I wish that innocence would never end
# Although memories will fade (no, no)
# Time will never take them away
# Chorus
# Yesterdays have been and gone
# Summer days that seemed so long
# All the things we did
# When we were young
# We had our share of smiles and tears
# It's been the same all through the years oh yeah
# Even shared our favourite songs
# When we were young
# Don't you know
# People come and go
# But sure as sun after rain
# In your heart friends will still remain
# Let me say
# If we should drift away
# And your heart feels the pain
# Let the good times bring you back again
# Sometimes I wish the days we had would never end
# Although time is moving fast (so fast)
# Memories are made to last
# Chorus
# Even on your own
# Know you'll never be alone
# The memories we made
# Time will never take them away

# And the summer days that seemed so long

# And I wish that I cuold have just one more chance
# And I wish that I could be your pillar of strength
# And I pray that you will see that what I'm sayin' is true
# 'Cause I, I wish for you
# In my mind I can see your face
# You're on the breath of every word I say
# If there's anyone to place the blame on- it's me

# How many times have - you fooled me and denied that
# It’s her whom you love and it sure isn’t me?
# So now that it’s over - I’ll try and take it sober
# Leave questions unasked, remember us laughing’ at the broken past
# God, if I could make it on without you
# You’re such a casual man, oh wavin’ an empty hand
# I’m helpless and I’m lonely without you
# Yes you’re a casual man, lendin’ an empty hand
# Left me breathless with nothing more to lose
# I used to dream we’d - take it nice and easy
# Get jobs settle down in Jameson Town
# If now you could see me - you’d think twice about leavin’
# Y’ said forever is the time you’re gonna spend around
# So why did you leave me? And why should I believe it?
# Y’ said goodbye! Oh why did you leave me? Why?
# You’re such a casual man, oh wavin’ an empty hand
# I’m helpless and I’m lonely without you
# Casual man, lendin’ an empty hand
# I’m helpless and I’m lonely without you
# You’re such a casual man, lendin’ an empty hand
# Left me breathless with nothing more to lose
# Except an evanescent unsubstantial blues…
