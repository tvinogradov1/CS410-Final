# From an ordinary house, in an ordinary road,
# From an ordinary town there came an ordinary girl,
# A face that looked surprised, a book of dog earred loans?
# Never made a sound, never said a word,
# Nothing was ever seen, nothing was ever heard,
# In an ordinary town, and an ordinary girl.
# She's feeling, outrageous, so daft and courageous,
# She's laughing, flirtacious, we're falling, unconscious,
# She's selfish, and needy, she's wanton and greedy,
# She's mugging, her lovers, she's bleeding her brothers from the level?
# In an ordinary house, in an ordinary town,
# Upon an ordinary street, nothing was ever found,
# By an ordinary girl who never made a sound.
# She's up in, the attic, she's bristling, with static
# ???
# She's wanton, and needy, she's selfish and greedy,
# She's mugging, her lovers, she's bleeding her brothers from the level?
# The ones she's, been kissing, are strangely, gone missing,
# The day when you wed her, you saw me unteather,
# This feeling, no never, they all went together
# With an ordinary girl

# And he knows that you'll never find out.

# Dear Mr. President,
# Come take a walk with me.
# Let's pretend we're just two people and
# You're not better than me.
# I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly.
# What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?
# Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
# What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
# Are you proud?
# How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
# How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
# How do you walk with your head held high?
# Can you even look me in the eye
# And tell me why?
# Dear Mr. President,
# Were you a lonely boy?
# Are you a lonely boy?
# Are you a lonely boy?
# How can you say
# No child is left behind?
# We're not dumb and we're not blind.
# They're all sitting in your cells
# While you pave the road to hell.
# What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
# And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
# I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
# You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine.
# How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
# How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
# How do you walk with your head held high?
# Can you even look me in the eye?
# Let me tell you 'bout hard work
# Minimum wage with a baby on the way
# Let me tell you 'bout hard work
# Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
# Let me tell you 'bout hard work
# Building a bed out of a cardboard box
# Let me tell you 'bout hard work
# Hard work
# Hard work
# You don't know nothing 'bout hard work
# Hard work
# Hard work
# Oh
# How do you sleep at night?
# How do you walk with your head held high?
# Dear Mr. President,
# You'd never take a walk with me.

# He was playing with his band
# I've always been a sucker had a weakness for a boy with a guitar and a drink in his hand
# His words were like heaven in my hurricane
# My knees buckled under
# I thought everyone was watching me
# Watching you save my life with the song
# You were mine
# In the back of my mind
# Oh just for one night
# Just for a while
# There's always one that gets away
# The one that sneaks up on you that slips away
# Two weeks later I was sitting in his apartment
# He was making cappuccino
# I said what kind of man makes cappuccino
# We laughed
# We laughed
# We laughed
# We laughed 'til tears ran down my face
# Oh but my man you're someone else's man
# And that ain't the man that I want
# But you keep drawing me in with those big brown lying eyes
# You'll always be mine
# In the back of my mind
# Oh we had a night
# Just a little while
# There's always one that gets away
# The one that sneaks up on you that slips away
# In a closed off corner of my heart yes

# No mountain's too high for you to climb
# All you have to do is have some climbing faith (oh yeah)
# No river's too wide for you to make it across
# All you have to do is believe it when you pray
# And then you will see the morning will come
# And every day will be bright as the sun
# All of your fears cast them on me
# I just want you to see
# I'll be your cloud up in the sky
# I'll be your shoulder when you cry
# I'll hear your voices when you're calling
# I am your angel
# And when all hope is gone I'm here
# No matter how far you are I'm near
# It makes no difference who you are
# I am your angel
# I'm your angel
# I saw your teardrops and I heard you cry
# All you need is time
# Seek me and you shall find
# You have everything and you're still lonely
# It don't have to be this way
# Let me show you a better day
# And then you will see the morning will come
# And all of your days will be bright as the sun
# So all of your fears just cast them on me
# how can I make you see?
# And when it's time to face the storm
# I'll be there by your side
# This place will keep us safe and warm
# And I know we will survive

# You grinding hard to get yours while the getting is good

# niggaz think it's all good 'til I swing on their boss
# (Gangsta, Gangsta) where every screamining it
# but ain't nobody meaning it, cause I know I ain't seeing it
# Real thugs don't party they just hold up the wall
# and buy bottles just in case they wanna start up a brawl
# It's an everyday thing nigga, home of the pen
# where niggaz wear the same color like it's part of they skin
# Down south or out West, look it's one in the same
# dark read or all blue, shit it's all in the gang
# You better watch your handshake when you greeting your boys
# cause if they know your man fake, they'll be heating your boys
# Even the bitches get down when they knowing it's beef
# they got her man in the pen and her kids in the street
# It's the neighborhood bullshit I gotta admit

# Kva, a zdej ste me ustavl, da bi me verbalno gnjavl
# Odpizdl, odjavl in iz scene odstavl
# Pa kva, če majca in hlače visijo mi z riti
# Za večino smo mi itak zadrogirani in zapiti
# Ampak ns je zmer več in na ulcah nismo skriti
# Usklajeni smo pa za stvari, k ne da se jih prikriti
# V naselju sem rojen, garam, da bi bil preskrbljen
# Duhovno sem osvobojen
# Tolk kt z musko zasvojen
# Zdaj pa hočte, da razpravljam z vami
# Pa mi zgleda, kot bi se pogovarju s kravo
# Ne dojamete niti vrstic, k povem jih za zabavo
# Najprej začnite mislt s svojo glavo
# Ker nč ni več zdravo
# V real lajfu je velik bolj krvavo
# Sploh če boriš se za stvar pravo
# V sožitju sem z vsem, tud z naravo
# Sovražm pa ustavo, ker na velko kradejo državo
# Prokleti pizduni neopredeljeni
# Vaši možgani so res zamegljeni
# Zato, ne se sprenevedat in ne me čudn gledat
# Če rečem, da sm voditelj zgubljenih duš
# Sam dobr poslušte
# Na frekvenci od Kopra do Ruš
# Zaenkrat tale verbalni obračun je še na fuš
# Matija Gubec, I. Vanish, Robin Hood, pojavm se kt duh
# Zato vsi pozor in posluh
# Veš, da smrtni greh je pohlep in napuh
# Zato se skuliri in umer
# Drgač raztrgam te k zver
# Ko borim se za pravice in mir
# Vate vnesem nemir
# Zakva pol do mene čutiš prezir?
# Zakva?
# …
# Zapomnte si, jst in ti, mi vsi smo ta življenjski krog
# Kar vidte in slište, je moj slog
# Dojemate pa kot majhen otrok
# Vsak dan se borim za obrok
# Nehte sam jamrat in kričat »O moj Bog!«
# Pridružte se mi, pa skenslam vam urok
# Zbrani, cajt je za pohod
# Ker noben noče bit v breme, za svet, k vrti se okol mene
# Demoni že renčijo mi čez vene
# Postajam vražje seme, razfukavam možgane kot Princ teme
# Kaute nardil? Zamenjal miselnost al gene
# Ker nočte več prfuknjene scene in zlagane fine kreme
# Tud če ne govorim, se moje besede vseen sliši
# Kdor bi rt kej povedu, mu predam majk
# Moje besede mu pa že odzvanjajo v duši
# Pa bomo vidl, kdo ga komu puši
# Prestol, na katerem sedite, se kruši
# Cajt je, da dokončno se zruši
# Vsi zatirani so z mano, zato sam ruši, ruši, ruši
# Zdaj me pa total zboljen gledate
# Saj vem, da nimate te moči
# Da bi vidl mestne noči čez moje krvave oči
# Ker pr ns noben mirno ne spi
# Droge, umori, kraje in ostale pizdarije
# Mi s tem žvimo, s tem gremo spat in s tem se zjutri zbudimo
# Ko o tem govorimo, jst pred blokom najdem rimo
# Za mlade, stare in za vse mulce
# Jst sm glas ulce
# Za izkoriščane in zatirane, za delavne in revne
# Jst sm njihov glas, zato sm zdej glasn
# A vam je mogoče zdej že kej bolj jasn?!

# MOJ NEMIR
# I. VANISH feat. APOSTOLBLU
# (M. Ivaniš, M. Anžin)
# Si lohk predstavljaš moj nemir na mestih
# Kjer velik ljudi v strahu živi in cele noči prebedi – a smo zveri?
# Policija non stop nas popisuje, pregleduje in teži
# Ampak, a smo res za vse mi krivi?
# Vse lohk spremenimo, če tvegamo
# Če se nobenga ne bojimo
# Zgrabmo priložnosti, ki vsak trenutek grejo mimo
# Sistem je u kurcu
# Ljudje padajo, ker neodgovorni vladajo
# Govori se o lastninjenju
# Jst pa vedno bliži sm ubijanju
# Za večino ljudi dons stvari so sam še na obroke
# Dnar gre v napačne odtoke
# Poskrbimo vsaj za otroke
# A sem res sam?
# A mi lohk podate roke?
# Kdo bo rešu naše otroke
# Oprau krvave roke
# Kdo bo očistu naše ulce
# Ne pobiru vroče tulce
# Kdo bo rešu to državo
# Kdo spremenu bo ustavo
# Nš sistem je zanka za naš vrat
# Mormo ga popravt, nazaj na noge se postavt
# Stojimo zdaj pred vami, zahtevamo odgovore
# Predn bo prepozn, prepozn za vse
# Za tvoj luxus so potrebni vsi
# Od smetarjev do kleparjev
# Od trgovcev do krovcev
# Od pekov do šefov
# Od voznikov do zdravnikov
# Od vseh fizikalcev do vseh intelektualcev
# Ker vsak poklic je treba cent in spoštovat
# Za vsako delo se je treba trudt in garat
# Čedalje širše so naše hlače
# Evropske cene, balkanske plače
# Neporavnane življenjske obveznosti
# Polni kreditov in obresti
# Velik jih nima za jest, pit, se skoz mesec prebit
# Izkoriščanje naivnosti državljanov, zaupanja v pravni sistem
# To je nš problem, profit pa gre tem
# K se jim dopušča, da izkoriščajo vsak tak manjkajoči člen
# Kdo bo rešu naše otroke
# Oprau krvave roke
# Kdo bo očistu naše ulce
# Ne pobiru vroče tulce
# Kdo bo rešu to državo
# Kdo spremenu bo ustavo
# Nš sistem je zanka za naš vrat
# Mormo ga popravt, nazaj na noge se postavt
# Stojimo zdaj pred vami, zahtevamo odgovore
# Predn bo prepozn, prepozn za vse
# Ni nam treba lagat, točn vem, kva se dogaja
# In ko govorim, povem to, kar se dogaja
# Kje so izpolnjene obljube?
# Tuki pekel daleč od obljubljenega raja
# Vse več nas je revnih
# Inflacija, brezposelnost narašča
# Vodilni pravijo, da se redči
# Vse več ljudi se zgublja v gneči
# In vsi gremo brez zahvale
# Čedalje bolj natrpane so naše Žale
# Moje vizije so goreče
# Nebo celo že je rdeče
# Povej, je to ubijanje?
# Kje je revolucionarno gibanje?
# Kaj jst čutm?
# Drugačn bo nš jutr
# Pazi, da ne stopiš na mino
# A lohk kdo sploh reš našo mladino?
# Ja, Vanish se sprašuje

# Foušija ne pozna meja

# Foušija tud drgje po svetu ta prvo besedo ima, ja
# Dejmo se že znebit tega sistema

# Takih zgodb je na tisoče, ta je napisana le zate
# Žalost vseh, ki so verjel vate
# Je moj blagoslov v spomin nate
# Ko tujec zlomi dušo in veselje
# Prjatli postanejo strah in hrepenenje
# Resničnost prikaže usodo v življenje
# Zamenja dan v mrak, rojstvo v pokop
# Deklici da telo ženske
# V srcu pa je še zmeraj otrok
# Hotla si preživet, hotla boljše življenje
# Spoznala pa le grenkobo in trpljenje
# Osamljena kot kriki v noči brez moči
# Brez toplega objema in brez pomoči
# Prestrašene oči čakajo, da se dan zbudi
# V tujem svetu, stran od poznanih ljudi
# Stran od vseh, ki so te imeli radi
# Edino spomini so ti ostali
# Teh se ne pozabi
# Naj te zdaj
# Angel pelje gor u raj
# Naj ti pokaže to
# Česar za tebe ni bilo
# Mlada in prodana, brez identitete
# Svet postane krut in stvari preklete
# Tisti, ki ne vete, zamislte se in odprite oči
# Med uporabniki uslug je velik uglednih in spoštovanih ljudi
# Preskrbljeni, ki imajo zdaj druge skrbi
# Tud politiki in visoki funkcionarji
# Prav tako naši možje, fantje in mornarji
# Vladarji tisočletja pa človeka prodajo
# Mižijo pa tisti, ki zakone poznajo
# S prstom kažejo in pljuvajo, ker druzga ne znajo
# Gre za življenja, oni pa pišejo grajo
# Kdo govori o prisili in manipulaciji
# Kdo bo to razložu mlajši generaciji? Kdo?
# Naj bo svet pravičnejši zdaj
# In takrat, ko tudi mene nikjer več ne bo
# Naj te zdaj
# Angel pelje gor u raj
# Naj ti pokaže to
# Česar za tebe ni bilo
# Ne vete, kako je, če si reven, osamljen, nemočen
# Necenjen, neoboževan in ponižan
# Brez resnic, pravic in lastne izbire
# Pretepen, neizobražen in duhovno iznakažen
# Komaj živ, v duši te pa več ni
# 20 star, pa s tabo delajo, kakor se jim zdi
# Brez izhoda, brez poti, dneve in leta
# Še ena v trgovini z belim blagom ujeta
# Življenje, ko se vsak dan bojiš
# Ko vsako sekundo trpiš
# Na meji, da ne znoriš
# Ko te noben ne sliši, ko govoriš
# Prisiljena si bila v prodajanje telesa
# Besede zate se same pišejo izpod peresa
# Naj ti angel razkaže nebesa
# Na lepšem kraju si zdaj, brez nemira in besa
# In uživaj življenje, brez žalosti in stresa

# Spremenila sva oba se glej
# A še vedno ista kakor prej
# Zgodba nadaljuje se le da
# Eden drugega več ne čutiva
# Čas zbriše v prah vse sledi
# Da občutek kot da ne boli
# A ko kdaj ujamem spet ta tvoj pogled
# Ne morem si verjet' želim si te že spet
# Le en trenutek tak za vedno spremeni vse
# Naj izbriše se in vrne te

# Se mi zdi kot bi mi ti
# Res hotel zadnje čase zmešat' lajf
# Dej mi povej
# Zakaj si se to spravil ravno zdej
# Telefon nonstop zvoni
# Tebi se zabavno zdi
# Jaz pa načrtujem že pobeg
# Zdej me ni doma
# Glavno da se ti ne sanja kam sem šla
# Dosegla sem vseen'
# Da ne težiš mi tak je bil namen
# Ti res misliš da
# Usodno sva povezana a to ni res
# Zato na liniji si
# Dokler ta postopoma ne pregori
# Zbujaš me sredi noči
# V glavi mi cel čas zvoni
# Edino kar ostane je pobeg
# Zdej me ni doma
# Glavno da se ti ne sanja kam sem šla
# Dosegla sem vseen'
# Da ne težiš mi tak je bil namen
# Že spet me ni
# Šla sem nekam kjer signal sploh ne lovi
# In grem lahko naprej
# Brez tvojih noro trapastih idej
# Zdej drugo žrtev našel  boš takoj
# Seveda seveda mogoče bo soseda
> I.C.E.
# Spet nov dan je izbran
# A vsak trenutek poseben je ker te poznam
# Res nevem naj povem
# Povezavo čutim zdaj in  dam te več nazaj
# Nehote se mi zdi da sedaj tudi ti
# Čutuš nekaj kar tli
# Dej se prepusti glasbi tej
# Dovoli da skupaj greva naprej
# Veš ta song je le zate
# Zdaj je čas da ti povem
# Sonce vstaja ne zahaja
# Odkar napisan ta refren
# Zlije melodije v zgodbo ki te zasvoji
# Zdaj že vejo prav vsi koliko pomeniš mi
# Zdaj živim na način
# Da vsak občutek v rimo takoj pretopim
# Vsak nov dih vrne stih
# Ritem naj zapelje te kamor si želi srce
# Ko trenutek je prvi žarek te
# Ujame tam kjer korak te popelje zdaj
# Kamor si želiš z rimo se stopiš
# Kjer ti melodija da vse kar sploh lahko dobiš

# ŽIVIM BREZ NAVODIL
# Hočem jok hočem smeh
# Hočem tudi greh
# Da spovem se ljudem
# Kamorkoli grem
# Pararam pararam
# Vzamem vse dam
# Pararam pararariram
# Se zazdi da ni dni
# Ki bi dali mi moči
# Ko dobim nov refren dobro vem
# Da lahko živim brez navodil
# Da lahko zamižim in si zaželim
# Želim želim si nekaj kar vzamem za spomin
# Noč in dan sta moja last
# Sanje zdej so moja strast
# A me ne zanima oblast
# Rabim na milijon idej
# Da se mi živi naprej
# Okej okej okej
# Hočem pot hočem čas
# Hočem na ves glas
# Da dobim izgubim
# Iščem nov način
# Pararam pararam
# Vzamem vse dam
# Pararam pararariram
# Ne sebe ne dam
# In vsega kar 'mam
# Ne vržem stran
# Ne ni mi vseen'
# Jaz hočem namen
# Ker dobro vem

# TEKST/LYRICS:
# [I.Vanish]:
# V dejanjih se postavljamo svetu nasproti
# Po pomoti uničujemo vse, kar je napoti
# V zmoti ga hočmo podredit in obvladat
# Nehi nakladat in dojam, da nočm vladat
# Hočem sprejet odgovornosti težkih stvari, ki pridejo iz naše bedne vesti
# Ko se zdi, da dvojnost človek – svet ne obstaja
# Se poraja, da sta neločljiva ograja
# Tesno povezana, en drugmu obvezana za nov vek
# Človek pa še naprej izkorišča planet
# Brez oči za stvari, zato je večno preklet
# In spet, kot slep, sprašujem se: zakaj?
# Se res bojimo smrti, kdo gre sploh u raj
# Ker cilj je vselej isti, hodmo po pisti
# Po poti trpljenja, proti razumevanju življenja.
# AUDENTES DEUS IPSE IUVAT (Hrabrim pomaga Bog)
# AUDENTES FORTUNA IUVAT (Hrabrim pomaga sreča)
# PUNCTUM EST, QUOD VIVIMUS (Živimo samo trenutek)
# ET ADHUC PUNCTO MINUS (Še manj kot trenutek)
# Šele v starosti, tam priča boš modrosti
# Da v norosti strahovi so pogosti
# Kdo komu vlada in kdo trepeta
# Nauč se gledat in spoštvat moč sveta
# Ta misel je sveta, iz dna duše vzeta
# Čista in nedolžno zapeta
# Dostopna vsem brez pojmovanja
# V svetu dinamike in stanja
# V času vladanja in uničevanja
# Ne glede na izobrazbo, prepričanje, vero
# V svoj obstoj vnesi jo polno mero
# Ker boj proti temu, kar te obdaja
# Je samo vmesna postaja na progi brez kraja
# Tam, kjer jemljemo vso dobroto
# Naš moto obstoja preide v zmoto
# Ker se dogaja pred svetovno poroto
# In na koncu se vse zlije v celoto.

# Folie de l'espace?
# Peur de la nuit absolue ? du silence absolu?
# De l'absolu d'un univers sans commencement ni fin?
# Non, non
# Assis sur un point infime de l'univers courbe
# Un paradis a Ã©tÃ© crÃ©Ã©; un instant, dÃ©tourne le regard
# Sur les Ã©toiles et leur lumiÃ¨re
# Des millions de vies possibles autour de la terre
# Dire qu'ils croyaient Ã  la platitude de la planÃ¨te
# Ceux qui parlaient de sphÃ¨re ont perdu la tÃªte
# A travers cela on a rÃ©alisÃ©
# L'insanitÃ©, les vanitÃ©s, les folies de l'humanitÃ©
# Mais tous savaient que rien ne se perd dans l'univers
# Pas de disparition de matiÃ¨re
# De DÃ©mocrite Ã  MendeleÃ¯ev, 2000 ans
# Un classement : le tableau pÃ©riodique des Ã©lÃ©ments
# Des molÃ©cules, structures atomiques
# Donnent matiÃ¨res minÃ©rales et organiques
# La vie est nÃ©e de l'infiniment petit
# Et l'homme en prend conscience seulement aujourd'hui
# Que ce qu'il y a dans son corps ressemble Ã©trangement
# Au systÃ¨me solaire et aux astres brillants
# Des frissons me parcourent en fixant et scrutant Ouranos
# Je m'incline, prisonnier du 7, et contient le cosmos
# Dans le cosmos
# Chang-Ti, symbole des rÃ©gions septentrionales
# Issu d'une philosophie restÃ©e dans les annales
# Bien longtemps sais tu
# Pendant des siÃ¨cles, il conversa avec ce qu'il y avait derriÃ¨re le ciel
# La vÃ©ritÃ© ne se trouve qu'Ã  l'intÃ©rieur de soi
# Mais l'homme a dÃ©truit son vÃ©ritable moi
# RÃ©git par les lois du matÃ©rialisme
# DÃ©composant l'univers comme le ferait un prisme
# Avec la lumiÃ¨re que l'on refuse de toucher
# Car il est clair qu'il faut vouloir pour essayer
# Elever sa spiritualitÃ©
# IntÃ©rieurement chercher Ã  s'Ã©veiller
# L'univers subit un dÃ©rÃ¨glement croissant
# On oublie que notre rÃ´le est important
# Comment parler d'harmonie avec les Ã©nergies suprÃªmes
# Lorsqu'on est en total dÃ©saccord avec soi-mÃªme?
# Que l'on se blottit sous l'aile de la compassion
# Ou sous l'anthropomorphisme d'une religion
# Nous Ã©tions sensÃ©s maintenir une symbiose
# En fait, nous avons trahi le cosmos
# Dans le cosmos
# Chaque Ãªtre a une place dans l'espace
# Et le vide est comme une grande glace
# La vitrine oÃ¹ le silence plane, une exposition
# Des plus beaux objets de la crÃ©ation
# Des bijoux rangÃ©s dans une cassette
# L'orfÃ¨vre est minutieux, tout est clair, tout est net :
# La hauteur, la largeur, la longueur, la position
# De toutes formes se dÃ©placant en trois dimensions. Attention !
# Le Temps, prince magnifique des mesures
# Accouchant du passÃ©, du prÃ©sent, du futur
# Et je joins les mains, laisse glisser les mots
# Augmente le pourcentage d'activitÃ© dans mon cerveau
# Tout est opposÃ© mais Ã©quilibrÃ© :
# La chaleur, le froid, la sÃ©cheresse et l'humiditÃ©
# Le bien, le mal, le jour, la nuit, le Ying et le Yang
# S'embrassant comme des frÃ¨res, Ã  l'instant du Big-Bang
# L'homme n'a plus les pieds sur terre mais dans sa merde
# Et attend impatient que son ignorance le perde
# Il croit en lui et en sa vision hÃ©misphÃ©rique
# En 360 degrÃ©s et l'horizon panoramique
# Le danger vient dans son dos comme Thanatos
# Car il a nÃ©gligÃ© ses origines : Le cosmos
# Une Ã©toile s'Ã©teint, une autre la remplace
# Il en est ainsi pour toute chose, c'est inÃ©vitable
# La vie, la mort, le clair, le sombre, autant de dualitÃ©s
# Parfois on choisit, parfois on ne peut s'y dÃ©rober
# Mais en tant que mÃ©diateur entre le ciel et la terre
# RÃ©git par l'un et dÃ©pendant de cette derniÃ¨re
# Notre tÃ¢che est d'assurer la liaison
# Mission non-remplie par la faÃ§on dont nous vivons
# Seuls quelques uns d'entre nous ont reÃ§u le message
# Cela nous dÃ©passe, nous les appelons sages
# Peut-Ãªtre qu'un jour, dans les annÃ©es qui viennent
# Nous comprendrons le message pourvu qu'il nous parvienne
# Et d'autres s'engageront sur le chemin DIVIN
# Car tout Baobab ne fut d'abord qu'une simple graine
# Je dÃ©laisse un instant ce que vous qualifiez d'utopique
# Dans la position du lotus, je vide mon esprit
# Atteint le mushin affÃ»te ma perception
# Laisse les ondes m'envelopper comme un cocon
# Mon Ã¢me s'Ã©veille l'Ã©nergie se renouvelle
# Rivalisant avec Thanos, je contiens le cosmos
# Dans le cosmos
# O Armakis
# Toi qui t'es Ã©levÃ© parmi les Ã©toiles indestructibles
# Tu ne disparaÃ®tra jamais !
# Dans le cosmos

# J'aurai pu croire en George Bush mais voilÃ
# Sa vision des U.S.A. ne me satisfait pas
# Justice Ã  2 vitesses pour les blancs pour les noirs
# Les gendarmes du monde ne mÃ©ritent pas l'Ã©gart
# Ils sont intervenus au KoweÃ¯t pour le pÃ©trole et l'argent
# Les droits de l'homme rien Ã  cirer au pays du clan
# Les marchands d'arme comptent les patriotes coÃ»tent chers
# Cool la guerre vu d'un fauteuil les soldats dans le dÃ©sert
# Il paraÃ®t que George aime les shits
# Surtout quand il se trouve entre le KoweÃ¯t et l'Irak
# Les Kurdes peuvent attendre vu qu'ils habitent
# PrÃ¨s de la frontiÃ¨re Turc au nord de Bagdad
# Ce justicier fait respecter les rÃ©solutions Ã  qui il veut
# Souffrant d'une sortie de la maison blanche sous les feux
# Quand un tomahawk tombe sur un hÃ´tel vous savez c'est normal
# La D.C.A Irakienne vise mal
# Dite moi je voudrais savoir
# Ce que ca vous fait de bombarder un pays qui a 6000 ans d'histoire
# Rien pour les auteurs d'un gÃ©nocide
# Moi j'aurai pu croire en Bush mais je ne le crois pas
# J'aurai pu croire en Sadam mais voilÃ
# Sur le drapeau Irakien il a fait Ã©crire Allah
# Comment peut-il faire ca aprÃ¨s avoir persÃ©cutÃ©
# TraquÃ© les fervents Musulmans pendant des annÃ©es
# Sadam tu ne me feras pas croire Ã  moi
# Que tu fais la priÃ¨re en dehors des camÃ©ras
# Sais-tu au moins qu'exhiber son portrait dans tous les coins
# Est interdit par notre livre saint le Coran
# Et tu blasphÃ¨mes blasphÃ¨mes et blasphÃ¨mes te prends pour Saladin
# Oubliant par la mÃªme qu'il Ã©tait d'origine Kurde
# Abusant ton peuple
# Manipulant les esprits Ã  la guerre s'interpelle
# " La guerre sainte se dit en Arabe :al-jihah fi sabil Allah

# Ã  l'extermination mais Ã  Ã©tendre Ã  de nouvelles contrÃ©s
# les droits de dieu et des hommes "
# Que les serviteurs du bien le maudisse
# Moi j'aurai pu croire en Sadam mais je ne le crois pas
# Croyez moi si vous le voulez
# Je ne crois pas
# J'aurai pu croire en IsraÃ«l mais
# Les diffÃ©rentes religions ni vivent pas en paix
# Les 2 tiers du territoire collectionnisme sont occupÃ©s
# Par l'ONU en 48 n'on jamais Ã©tÃ© attribuÃ©s
# Face Ã  tous ces Ruses et ces Polonais fraÃ®chement arrivÃ©s
# Et qui ont chassÃ© les Palestiniens qui habitaient sur cette terre
# Et qui l'ont travaillÃ©e et chÃ©rie pendant des millÃ©naires
# On les a conduit dans des camps et dÃ©pouillÃ© lÃ
# Ils furent massacrÃ©s Ã  Sabra et Chatila
# Dieu a signifiÃ© aux hommes de toutes les races
# Ne fait pas aux autres ce que tu n'aimerais pas que l'on te fasse
# AprÃ¨s les tueries par ces chiens de Nazi
# Je ne peux pas croire que vous ayez agit ainsi
# J'ai rÃªver une nuit de 2 beaux frÃ¨res jumeaux
# Palestine et IsraÃ«l en harmonie souverain et Ã©gaux
# Mais balles contre cailloux canons Ã  pierres
# ExpulsÃ© aux frontiÃ¨res je ne puis me taire
# Le David enfant est devenu Goliath moi
# J'aurai pu croire IsraÃ«l mais je ne le crois pas
# j'aurai pu croire en Khomeiny en son sectarisme
# Son crÃ©dot manque de beaucoup de rÃ©aliste
# Incapable de dissocier tradition et Islam
# Rien qu'Ã  la maniÃ¨re dont il traite les femmes
# Dieu n'a jamais rien dit de si indigne
# Et chaque livre saint ce comprend entre les lignes
# MÃ©langer politique et religion signifie
# Donner la victoire au matÃ©riel face Ã  l'esprit
# Ã€ l'humain face au divin Ã  l'instant face au passÃ©
# Quiconque croit en dieu sur terre n'a pas besoin de diriger
# L'histoire le prouve Ã  chaque Ã©poque moi
# J'aurai pu croire en Ayatollah mais je ne le crois pas
# J'aurai pu croire en l'occident si
# Tout ces pays n'avaient pas eu de colonies
# Et lors de l'indÃ©pendance ne les avaient dÃ©coupÃ©s comme des tartes
# Aujourd'hui il y a des guerres Ã  cause des problÃ¨mes de cartes
# MorositÃ© quelle est la source
# Ils ne jurent sur jamais rien d'autre que la bourse
# Eu aussi ont leurs intÃ©gristes fana
# La tolite pyromane qui mettent le feu au cinÃ©ma
# Leur rÃ©alitÃ© show leur tÃ©lÃ© pourri

# Dans tout ce chaos je sais oÃ¹ je suis

# Ils sont lÃ , le couteau entre les dents
# Ils croient qu'on est qu'des rude boys, nÃ©s pour livrer bataille
# Frappant les tam-tams quand Ã§a poigne, quand j'entre entre la racaille
# Leur connerie est de taille Ã  masquer l'ignorance
# Et si par miracle un doute les assaille, se tiennent les relances
# Les masques, les gardes et l'oeil sur leur bectance, la main sur la panse
# Faut qu'ils sachent que les nÃ´tres servent Ã  autre chose que vol et maintenance
# Jusque dans ces bleds pommÃ©s de France oÃ¹ la peur va croissante
# Haine du croissant naissance
# Pendant que seul le dico parle de violence
# Versant dans l'indÃ©cence des idÃ©es germent, issues de sales semences
# Toujours les mÃªmes sÃ©quences
# Un idiot creuse un trou, y'en a 100 qui s'y lancent
# Dame complaisance fait son entrÃ©e omnipotente
# Et eux la regardent passer tant que Ã§a danse le dimanche
# Et pensent garder leur chance
# Et v'lÃ  ma jeunesse, la foule
# Ceux pour qui le monde s'ouvre
# Chouf, v'lÃ  la sale bouffe
# Celle qu'tes cauchemars couvrent (couvrent !)
# Grince les dents, c'est le rÃ©veil Ã©vident
# Nos vies s'vidant
# Du bon sens on t'met du consistant
# Ecris le avant de choper ta syncope, hÃ© l'propre !
# C'est le sale qui te branche, note
# A travers notre faute !
# Ca doit venir de ces colonies oÃ¹ la chaleur mÃ¨ne
# Mais pas ta flamme du mal qui dirige vos haines
# Et prends-toi Ã§a !
# Et appelle si t'as besoin de sous-titres
# Sur mon pupitre y' a pas de place pour les sous-pitres
# La vÃ©ritÃ© c'est que vous craignez vos faiblesses tous autant que vous Ãªtes
# Nous on combat Ã§a avec un art qui se dresse et vexe !
# [Faf Larage]
# Et voilÃ , on y est maintenant, et tu sais de quoi Ã§a parle !
# Chorus x2
# Y'a pas que les nuits qui sont noires, y'a les Ã¢mes si nos beats crament
# Les dÃ©mons les arment, souillÃ©s par le charme
# Y'a pas que les mots qui font mal, y'a les actes
# PensÃ©e animale, suit la consÃ©quence, raison minimale
# Ils sont lÃ , le couteau entre les dents
# T'as la frousse pour ton CitroÃ«n C3 qu'une horde dÃ©barque
# Avec une tire braquÃ©e dans ton chemin de pointes et droits
# Amalgame et effroi en fond de l'exil amenant icÃ´ne et croix
# Souvenir d'un bled cramÃ© qu'la faim nettoie
# Propagande sous les toits, guerre Ã  nos portes, chez le Gotha c'est l'extase
# Import, export, transport
# Ils guettent les chiffres comme Ã  la bourse de Francfort
# Ils collent Ã  nos basques un dÃ©nommÃ© Oussama comme Ã©tant notre meilleur mentor
# Des Viet-Cong on a gardÃ© que le mental, ce qui a fait de nous des warriors
# A la carriÃ¨re bien peu instrumentale, loin du standard stupide de l'inclus vendable
# Loin des buffets oÃ¹ ces hyÃ¨nes bandables s'nourrissent des fruits du scandale
# [Faf Larage]
# Ils voudraient tous nous voir Ã  l'agonie, au bord de l'asphyxie
# La peur au ventre qu'on les envahisse d'Afrique jusqu'en Laponie
# Ils parlent de dÃ©mocratie, flippent sur la dÃ©mographie
# Des mots nous qualifient de dÃ©mons, sur les monts
# On y vit pas on est lÃ , stagne en bas de chez toi
# De chez eux dans les rues, les blocs, ils nous damnent mais on les voit pas
# Et on va pas refaire l'histoire du monde
# Si c'est un miroir qui nous gÃ¨ne alors fuck je reprÃ©sente les monstres
# La chasse est ouverte et les uniformes grondent
# Mais ailleurs dans le monde Ã§a les gÃªnent pas qu'on creuse des tombes
# Et qui sait ce qu'ils nous rÃ©servent
# Quand ils nous guettent t'inquiÃ¨te, on sait ce qu'ils ont dans la tÃªte mec
# Ouais, et Ã§a fait peur, mais on se bat, et l'Histoire jugera

# Backstage ! La tension est Ã  son comble
# "Y'a que les mecs" du groupe 7, c'Ã©tait le nombre
# Debout avec autant de pression sur le dos
# Que le bathyscaphe de Cousteau
# Relax un max, Chill Ã§a va, pas de bruit, pardi, oui
# Minuit l'heure de fumer le M.I.C
# Avec la masse de nouveaux tout nouveaux morceaux
# Chauds, j'aimerais que la foule dise ooh
# DÃ¨s que l'on rentre et que toutes les rampes sont allumÃ©es
# 2 minutes et tout le monde est prÃªt
# Une expression verbale et deux barils d'esssence
# Que l'on verse et verse verse sur les gens qui dansent
# A part les textes le cross fade est un silex
# S.7.7.0. bÃ»le le boomer et l'abÃ®me
# La flamme est dans le corps des danseurs
# Rapidement passe dans la salle et les coeurs
# (Chorus) (X4]
# Ce soir on vous met le feu
# C'est nous les Marseillais
# Nous n'en sommes pas arrivÃ©s lÃ  en un jour
# Notre bagage n'a pas Ã©tÃ© fait en un tour
# De main je m'en vais donc conter le parcours
# Et croyez que le voyage ne sera pas court
# Il y eut beaucoup de morceaux composÃ©s que l'on a modifiÃ©s
# De rimes calculÃ©es de feuilles raturÃ©es
# Et des heures passÃ©es Ã  Ã©chantilloner
# Sans savoir vraiment si cela marcherait
# Et tous ces kilomÃ¨tres que l'on s'est tapÃ©s
# MoÃ¯se Ã  cÃ´tÃ© de nous, n'a fait que se promener
# On partait le matin tÃ´t, tout frais
# On arrivait le soir avec un bÃ¢ton et des caligaes
# Cela s'est rÃ©pÃ©tÃ© tant et tant de fois que les stations d'essence
# Ont le sourire aux lÃ¨vres dÃ¨s qu'elles nous voient
# Pour aller faire un concert Ã  l'autre bout de la France
# On avait l'impression que c'Ã©tait le temps des transhumances
# Toutes ces randonnÃ©es dans un but prÃ©cis
# Celui de monter sur scÃ¨ne, histoire de voir si
# La tempÃ©rature augmente dans le foule peu Ã  peu
# Afin que nous puissions y mettre quoi? Le feu
# (Chorus)
# Ce soir on vous met le feu
# Oh hisse oui, enculÃ© non
# Mets tes mains bien en l'air si c'est bon
# Respecte le mÃ©tÃ¨que et tout ira bien
# Assure le steak ou fait un chÃ¨que, la meute a faim
# Partis de rien aujourd'hui parmi vous sur scÃ¨ne
# A la force des mots sans user de danses obscÃ¨nes
# Saute si tu veux crie si tu le peux
# On met le feu On met le feu On met le feu je veux
# Des filles arrivent par ci par lÃ
# Minga, hasta la vista seÃ±orita
# Iam est ici pour embraser la nuit la partie
# Tu veux des sous un crÃ©dit, trouve-toi un job chÃ©rie
# Dieu que j'en rÃªve Dieu que j'en rÃªve Dieu
# Donne-moi la force de foutre le feu
# Aux yeux des spectateurs et des spectatrices
# Expectateurs de cette voie destructrice
# Donne-moi la volontÃ© pour ensuite Ã©couter
# IAM est dans la place je vais
# Signaler que si tu sais que l'on vient en live
# Dans ta ville, vite tape le 18
# Putain de fil de micro qui me casse les chut
# Je m'y suis pris les pieds encore un peu c'Ã©tait la chute
# Sinon, tout va bien chacun s'acquitte de sa tÃ¢che
# A part quelques crises de folies de notre Papin du scratch
# La foule rÃ©pond bien tout le monde tape des mains
# On envoie le prochain morceau et la oooh oh
# AkhÃ©naton tu les sent prÃªts lÃ ?
# Ouais, je crois qu'ils le sont, vas-y tu peux y aller
# A ma droite est-ce que vous Ãªtes prÃªts pour la premiÃ¨re vague?
# Ouais !!!
# A ma gauche Ãªtes-vous prÃªts Ã  vous dÃ©foncer les cordes vocales?
# Ouais !!!
# Pas de problÃ¨me pas de problÃ¨me Ã§a vous engraine
# Ah Ah ! Ca va filer, c'est pas la peine
# Le bordel on vous garantit pendant 1 heure ou 2
# Ce soir (ce soir) ce soir on vous met le feeeeuuuuuu
# (Chorus)
# Appelez-les pompiers

# 10 h37, les opÃ©rations commencent
# Ma compagnie est fin prÃªte et les missiles s'Ã©lancent
# Sur la colline d'en face, les canons
# Crachent le feu de l'enfer obÃ©issant aux galons
# Combien d'amis sont partis?
# Combien d'amis restent enfermÃ©s dans un asile opÃ©rationnel, sur le terrain, peste
# Soit avec leurs sourires qui me tuent tous les jours
# Les hÃ©licos me rendent fou, les hommes courent
# Afin de fuir la mort qui fauche les corps, elle coche
# La vie est poker, la fin est moche c'est une quinte flush
# MÃªme dans mes pires cauchemars ce n'Ã©tait pas si
# Sordide un fratricide lÃ©gitime impuni
# Ce n'est qu'un jeu macabre dans un champ de plaques de marbre
# OÃ¹ les plus fiers se retirent pour aller mourir sous un arbre
# Les horreurs du combat, en tout cas, m'ont vite appris
# La raison pour laquelle ceux qui sont morts sourient
# Les obus pleuvent autour
# Coupant les arbres Ã  chaque impact, claquent seulement pour
# Mutiler. Est-ce bien utile et futile; et mon rÃ´le
# Dans la mÃªlÃ©e, la clameur quand mille balles me frÃ´lent
# Maintenant se courbe dans le front
# Nos officiers tuent de sang froid ceux qui de nous se cachent
# Et courent Ã  reculons. ConnaÃ®tre leurs visages ? Ne t'en soucie pas
# C'est une simple histoire de soldat (X2)
# 10 h50, les combats font rage
# L'orÃ©e du bois est couleur pourpre et jonchÃ©e de cadavres
# Je n'hÃ©site pas Ã  tirer aveuglÃ©ment sans savoir
# Prendre le train de la vie, pendant qu'il n'est pas encore trop tard
# Quand je pense Ã  la nuit derniÃ¨re, sans Ã©toiles
# OÃ¹ les balles traÃ§antes tissaient leurs toiles lÃ©tales
# J'avais si peur de mourir, d'Ãªtre blessÃ© et pourrir
# L'angoisse me tÃ©tanise, j'ai trop de mal Ã  me nourrir
# Ceux d'en face ont peut-Ãªtre le mÃªme Ã¢ge que moi
# Ils ont une mÃ¨re qui sera inconsolable, s'ils n'en reviennent pas
# Et qui sait, ils auraient pu Ãªtre mes amis
# Chaque fois que j'en vois un sans vie, je vomis
# C'est fou ce qu'on peut penser quand on est sÃ»r d'y passer
# ChassÃ©-croisÃ© dans un fossÃ© creusÃ©, tout prÃ¨s Ã  enterrer
# Regarde autour, l'aurore est l'invitÃ©e aujourd'hui
# AssistÃ©e dans son oeuvre noire de Dame Folie
# ConnaÃ®tre mon visage ? Ne t'en soucie pas
# C'est une simple histoire de soldat (X2)
# 11 h40, tout en haut de la colline
# Je n'arrive pas Ã  croire que l'ascension fut si facile
# La rÃ©sistance adverse fut faible
# Notre colonel se vante d'avoir fondu comme un aigle
# Sur l'objectif, qu'on nous ordonne d'inspecter
# De bien Ãªtre attentif, afin de prendre des prisonniers
# Quand j'arrive sur les lieux, tout n'est que cendres et poussiÃ¨re
# Les gradÃ©s fÃ©licitÃ©s sont tout fiers
# Les battisses ne prÃ©sentent aucun aspect hostile
# Mon Dieu !! On a massacrÃ© des civils !!
# Je cours au milieu des corps des familles dÃ©cimÃ©es
# Des tas de gens paisibles que la guerre a tuÃ©s
# Nos gÃ©nÃ©raux, nos colonels n'en ont pas perdu le sourire
# A croire qu'ils le savaient, mon Ã¢me me dit tire
# Dans le tas; tous ces meurtres pour une raison unique:
# Prendre la colline, un endroit stratÃ©gique
# Le drame est intÃ©rieur, depuis ce jour-lÃ , j'attends
# J'ai perdu mon humanitÃ© ce beau matin de printemps
# En vÃ©ritÃ©, je n'ai jamais su pourquoi je me bats
# C'est une simple histoire de soldat

# [Chorus 1 2x: Ice Cube]
# I see you, Over there, Lookin like somethin wrong
# Cause I'm over here, Sittin on some chrome
# Shotgun to the dome
# Bend a corner wit me
# [Verse 1: Ice Cube]
# When shit get boring, I jump in some foreign
# Explorin through my neighborhood, All to the good
# Ain't the finest order riches
# Still got ordinary bitches to jehovah's witness
# Tryin to get wit this
# Know I got the green thumb, Hustler you never seen one
# Extreme fun, Wit this mean one
# But you'll never get none fuckin wit them broke hoes
# Pinnochios, Fuck around and get a broke nose
# That's ya fate when we congregate
# It's the great writer, Exponium big spider
# Tighter than virgin cocks, At the mall like dispurge a lot
# Like these niggaz servin rocks
# But I'm servin rhymes, Two cds at a time
# Like it's weight, Ice cube the great
# [Chorus 2: Mr. Short Khop]
# Bend a corner wit me, We can ride to the store
# Do it like friends do, What I'm into?
# Everything on the menu, Wit extras on it
# Cmon baby and jump up on it
# Chorus 1
# [Verse 2: Ice Cube]
# This one is strictly, For niggaz rollin 750s
# And it's polished from the 60s
# Bumpin that cube shit, Do shit, I bet the wheels fall off
# Before the skills fall off
# Throw up the dub, Got more cocks to rub
# And if you don't, I done got this far without yo love
# Hoes want the nigga in the t-shirt and rolex
# And y'all still get the .9 up out the kotex
# Got the o.z., And the x.o
# Broads get fatal, And don't wanna let go
# Incredible, Nigga who you rap like?
# Come out the movie, Who you act like?
# It's the don, Still rappin 2000 and beyond
# Tryin to come up on another million
# Chorus 2
# Chorus 1
# [Verse 3: Mr. Short Khop]
# From the gate, Khop want the whole plate
# Want my drink and eat the whole cake
# And won't wait until another nigga say go
# I lay low wit the tweed and the yayo
# And play po, And stop niggaz knackin
# Still keep the set crackin
# All about the cheese and how it's stackin
# And plus, It's mo cheddar down the line
# Ain't no better time for me and a gang of niggaz on the grind
# Tryin to get the income, And then some
# Stash a little bit and spin some
# Keep it poppin till the end come
# Can't stop it, Then shawties wanna grip
# 24/7, Money got a nigga whipped
# Chip after chip, But if I slip
# Have the homie send me o.t. and work the flip
# Cause the world is payola
# Silk the spot and left connect on ya wall in a black crayola

# I prayed for her soul....I prayed for her peace
# When I close my eyes
# I see her face, it comforts me
# When I close my eyes
# Memories cut like a knife
# The blood is the life, and Christ I defy.
# My sworn enemy...birth of a new creed.
# Is this my reward for serving God's own war?
# The blood I've spilled for faith fulfilled.
# To damn her, a disgrace, you spit back in my face.
# I served you loyally, and you spew blasphemy.
# I avenge with darkness, the blood is the life
# The Order of the Dragon, I feed on human life
# There are far worse things awaiting man than death
# Come taste what I have seen
# I'm spreading my disease
# I will feed upon His precious child
# The human race will bleed, they will serve my need.
# (Pre-chorus)
# I avenge with darkness, the blood is the life
# The Order of the Dragon, I feed on human life
# (Chorus)
# I am the Dragon of blood, a relentless prince of pain
# Renouncing God on His throne
# My blood is forever stained
# For true love I shall avenge
# I defy the creed that damned her

# Since the dawn of time, he's been here
# Forgotten son, testing all our fears
# Nature's mistake, he sees no end
# The dragon's child, walks among man
# For centuries past, many tribes know the tales
# Of men not returning, when they've gone there
# And those who've returned, can't describe what they've seen
# Their hair has turned white, and they've gone insane
# Oh, beware the blackend water
# The creature has come to take you away
# Oh, beware unholy water

# A mastermind in the old watchtower
# Prying eyes must never find.
# Playing God in the final hour
# Insanity, such a fine line
# Overwhelmed by the mourning process
# And the loss of his dearly loved
# The Doctor's work is now obsession
# What is life? What's beyond?
# He wants to know what it's like to be God
# Creating life with his own hands
# To reanimate lifeless tissues
# The Devil's work, the doctors plan
# A man of wealth and a genius mind
# A slave to passion and his morbid side
# Robbing graves of the nearly dead
# Erratic tendencies, a troubled mind
# I will create in my own image
# If God can then why can't I?
# No thought of the consequences
# I've got to know the meaning of life
# Lightning strikes, it's the witching hour
# The monstrosity comes alive
# A victim of man's vanity
# Born in delirium, a deranged child
# He turns his back on his own creation
# Chaos ensues, the innocent die
# Who's the monster?
# Who's the victim?

# Searching for the reason why I've gone
# But I will always be here
# By your side, through the darkest night
# Here I'll stand on the firing line

# You don't know I've not gone away
# You see I watch over fighting men
# So they can have peace again
# And maybe someday you will all be free
# Here I'll stand on the firing line
# Here I'll walk through the field where I died
# I will fight and let the voice ring true
# I am the ghost
# Standing next to you
# You speak to me
# And I feel your pride
# Assuring me I'll never die
# I write Mother...
# "He's here with me..."
# He's in our minds
# He's in our souls
# Of sacrifice his story's told
# He holds the flame of freedom for all to see
# Here we stand on the firing line
# Here I'll walk in the field where I fight
# I will fight of die for liberty

# His future concealed as he begs to be told
# A kiss from the gypsy, he'll never grow old
# Oh no, this can't be
# Demonic infection, a doomed changeling

# Even a man who's pure
# And says his prayers by night
# (He won't hear your prayers)
# Man become a wolf
# When the wolf bane blooms,
# And the autumn moon is bright
# (There's a full moon tonight)
# Man may become a wolf.
# He who is bitten by a wolf and lives
# Possession soon follows, no use to resist
# Oh no, this can't be
# Cursed by the moonlight, a doomed changeling
# The madness a turmoil that swells up inside
# To truly find peace is to truly die
# Oh no, this can't be
# Cursed by the moonlight, a doomed changeling
# Now comes the rampage, a killing spree
# Hunting his loved ones comes instinctively
# Oh no, it's maddening
# A shape-shifting demon of pure lunacy
# A shot from the darkness tears through its flesh
# A bullet of silver lays it to rest
# Oh no, it's maddening
# An innocent victim finds his peace.

# I’ll let the music play
# while love lies softly bleeding
# In heavy hands on shadowlands
# As thunder clouds roll in
# Sunset is receding.
# No summer wine – no Valentine
# A tiger trapped inside a cage
# An actor on an empty stage
# Come see the show!
# Rock ‘n’ roll can heal your soul
# When broken hearts lose all control
# Some rivers still run dry
# And jungles burn to embers
# Gold autumn days, must fade to grey
# There is a reason why
# A haunted man remembers
# One frozen night – his darkest day (oh...)
# A tiger trapped inside a cage
# An actor on an empty stage
# Come see the show!
# Rock ‘n’ roll will heal your soul
# When broken hearts lose all control
# Passion killed by acid rain
# A rollercoaster in my brain
# But, how would you know!
# In your satin, silk and lace...
# Another time another place
# A tiger trapped inside a cage
# An actor on an empty stage
# Come see the show!
# Rock ‘n’ roll will heal your soul
# When broken hearts lose all control
# A love let loose and painted black
# A train stuck on a broken track
# I’ll let it go!
# Rock ‘n’ roll has healed my soul
# The stage is set – on with the show!

# Bambino che sorridi e ti sorrido anch'io,
# fra queste mille strade della vita
# fatti furbo e scegli la salita,
# che forse è quella più vicina a Dio.
# Scrivile sull'acqua le tue poesie,
# parla con gli animali e con i fiori
# e ruba al cielo tutti i suoi colori
# ed arrossisci dopo le bugie.
# Fatti furbo,
# affacciati prudente come un filo d'erba
# e ascolta il vento cosa ti dirà,
# sicuro nella tua fragilità, ingenuamente.
# Fatti furbo,
# dai sempre tutto a chi non ti può dare niente
# e fai del cuore il tuo salvadanaio,
# se ti sfiora un soffio d'infelicità,
# fatti furbo
# e prendi questa vita come va!
# Quando avrai paura dell'oscurità
# prendi la luna e legala al cuscino,
# cresci ma resta sempre un po' bambino
# e il mondo tuo giocattolo sarà!
# Fatti furbo e sogna l'impossibile,
# cerca un amore piccolo e gigante,
# l'amore quello più forte della morte
# e quando passerà vicino a te
# fatti furbo,
# non fare come me che ho preso un frutto acerbo,
# gli ho dato un morso e l'ho buttato via
# e adesso ne ho un'enorme nostalgia. Diventa grande
# e guarda gli occhi
# di una ragazza che non apre mai la bocca
# e tiene tutto dentro come te
# e, se un giorno verrà il giorno dell'addio,
# fatti furbo
# e non lasciarla come ho fatto io...
# Fatti furbo

# Eri fin da piccolo il più brutto del quartiere,
# ti chiamavi Franco, detto anche Frankenstein,
# io ti prendevo in giro con quel gusto un po' crudele
# dei ragazzi che hanno tutto e non gli basta mai.
# Rosso di capelli e con i brufoli sul viso,
# verso i sedici anni eri già due metri e tre,
# uno spilungone che scopriva col sorriso
# l'apparecchio ai denti e un cuore pieno di perché.
# Tu mi difendevi roteando come pale
# quelle mani enormi che non hai usato mai
# per picchiare gli altri, per paura di far male,
# e ora che la vita ti ha fregato e non lo sai...
# Come stai, vecchio Frankenstein,
# in un letto di ospedale troppo piccolo?
# Tutti al bar ti salutano
# e tu piangi grande e grosso come sei.
# Frankenstein, quando guarirai,
# ti prometto compreremo quella zattera
# e col mare la ferita si richiuderà, vedrai,
# e t'insegnerò a nuotare nella vita, Frankenstein!
# Franco torneremo la domenica allo stadio,
# poi la sera tardi finiremo in pizzeria
# e saranno i sogni, come sempre, il nostro video,
# perché abbiamo dentro un sangue di periferia.
# Perché abbiamo perso tutti quanti una ragazza
# che ha sposato un altro bello e ricco più di noi
# e Francesca non ha visto mai la tua bellezza,
# Franco, perché l'anima è invisibile, lo sai!
# Ci ributteremo come pazzi nello studio,
# perché l'ignoranza è la peggiore malattia,
# piccolo anatroccolo più grosso di un armadio,
# che nascondi un cigno che vorrebbe volar via...
# Frankenstein, ora svegliati,
# non lasciarmi qui da solo come un bischero!
# Franco, dai, non arrenderti,
# dimmi che t'incazzi e questa volta ti difenderai!
# Frankenstein, quando guarirai,
# verrò a prenderti con due puttane in macchina
# e spenderemo in una notte tutti i soldi miei e tuoi.
# Prenderemo ancora a botte questa vita, Frankenstein!

# Le canzoni non si scrivono

# le canzoni basta coglierle
# ce n'e' una anche per te
# che fai piÃƒÂ¹ fatica a vivere
# e non sorridi mai.
# le canzoni sono zingare
# e rubano poesie
# sono inganni come pillole

# le canzoni non guariscono
# amori e malattie

# che l'esistere ci da'
# passerÃƒÂ , passerÃƒÂ
# se un ragazzo e una chitarra sono li
# come te, in cittÃƒÂ
# a guardare questa vita che non va
# che ci ammazza d'illusioni
# e con l'etÃƒÂ  delle canzoni
# passerÃƒÂ  su di noi
# finiremo tutti in banca prima o poi
# coi perchÃƒÂ©, i chissÃƒÂ
# e le angosce di una ricca povertÃƒÂ
# a parlare degli amori che non hai
# a cantare una canzone che non sai come fa
# perchÃƒÂ© l'hai perduta dentro
# e ti ricordi solamente
# passerÃƒÂ  ....
# in un mondo di automobili
# e di gran velocitÃƒÂ
# per chi arriva sempre ultimo
# per chi si dice addio
# per chi sbatte negli ostacoli
# della diversitÃƒÂ
# le canzoni sono lucciole
# che cantano nel buio
# passerÃƒÂ  prima o poi
# questo piccolo dolore che c'e' in te
# che c'e' in me, che c'e' in noi
# e ci fa sentire come marinai
# in balia del vento e della nostalgia
# a cantare una canzone che non sai
# come fa
# ma quel piccolo dolore che sia odio, o che sia amore
# passerÃƒÂ
# passerÃƒÂ , passerÃƒÂ
# anche se farai soltanto la la la
# passerÃƒÂ , passerÃƒÂ

# I don't wanna talk about the things we've gone through
# Though it's hurting me now it's history
# I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too
# Nothing more to say, no more ace to play
# The winner takes it all, the loser standing small
# Beside the victory that's her destiny
# I was in your arms thinking I belonged there
# I figured it made sense building me a fence
# Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there
# But I was a fool playing by the rules
# The God's may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice
# And someone way down here loses someone dear
# The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall
# It's simple and it's plain why should I complain
# But tell me does she kiss like I used to kiss you
# Does it feel the same when she calls your name
# Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you
# But what can I say rules must be obeyed
# The judges will decide, the likes of me abide
# Spectators of the show always staying low
# The game is on again, a lover or a friend
# A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all
# I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad
# And I understand you've come to shake my hand
# I apologize if it makes you feel bad
# Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence

# [Intro - Sampled from "Signs"]
# The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed
# by a forty-two year old - Romero Valadares
# This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's seventh birthday
# In the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil. It was sent to the local news bureau there
# and sent to us by a sattelite just a few minutes ago
# All initial opinions are; this is genuine
# What you are about to see, may disturb you..
# [Verse 1]
# Murder forensicles, surrounded by alternative tentacles
# Extra-terestials step out of starships in pressure-suits
# Claiming humans were created inside of test-tubes
# Horryfing with huge eyesockets recemble headwounds
# Pumpin the protoplasma, jello-like substance
# Lookin like goldblum in The Fly, but more dusted
# Don't trust their reptilian tounge
# They come in peace is what they claim
# When their true intentions are to have the world in chains
# Said, they came from beyond the stars, unexplenable
# Religious people thought they coming was a sign from God
# They thought these were the Eloheem
# When the first mothership arrived over the planet, it was a creepy scene
# A huge hovering metal structure stretching for over 5 miles every direction
# Blocking perception, every news channel, 24 hour-coverage stopping commercials
# Doctors, experts, UFO's, crop-cicles, arguing generals in closed doors-meetings
# Religious cults claiming to know the meaning of these beings
# Many of these cults claimed to have been abducted
# Probe-prodded and fistfucked and caught in the tractor-beam and lifted up
# - Into the lab, strap you to tables, made you endure
# Series of tests, pushin beyond the limits of stress
# Wakin up in a cold field naked, barely alive
# Every inch of your body's in pain, you barely survive
# Milleniums ago, starmaps were drawn to sand
# The meanings of the pyramids has long tortured man
# Pharoahs and Hebrews, Mayans and Aztecs
# Mathemetically perfect architects the many gods have blessed
# Hieroglyphics become the blueprint of primal physics
# Pyramids buried kings screams, tribal clerics
# Radar-signals from space bouncing off burnt rocks
# Responsible for the travel in Alien Workshop

# [Ill Bill]
# I eat politicians for breakfast
# Till infinity it's endless
# Bill and Hillary, George Bush, everybody's gettin it
# Presidents, Supreme Court Justices, and Senators
# Run up in the White House
# Erase people, edit them
# Press delete, hit em in the chest with heat
# Hail to the chief
# Bullets everywhere, its beef
# Violence is more American than apple pie and Soul Train
# Baseball, nickel-plated nines, and cocaine
# It's Ill Bill, Non-Phixion
# If I offended you with my words I meant it
# Protected by the First Amendment
# If this was Iraq I'd a been beheaded
# Instead of sparkin a dime log
# I'd be hangin in Baghdad shredded
# Yeah I recognize
# But if I ever disappear under mysterious pretenses
# You guess why
# I guess the CIA's trying to die
# They wanna terrorize the kid
# And fry him alive
# (Chorus)
# Scared heads and Black hebrews
# Punk rockers and Hip-Hoppers
# Street pharmacists, drug dealers, witch doctors
# Rappers wearing hundred thousand dollar wrist watches
# Little kids starving, the police killed his father
# Rich man, poor man, civilized man, Tarzan
# Who's right? fightin over God's land
# American History X
# Represent the future unknown
# What's next?
# [Ill Bill]
# I leave an ATF truck burning with the passengers in it
# Hit it with anti-aircraft missiles with Bill's spid-it
# No apologies, asking what's wrong with truth
# Tell me whats wrong with the world
# I'll tell you what's wrong with you
# What's wrong with the youth
# Brain eating, corpses, and coupes
# Sorcerers and spooks
# Luminating torturous kooks
# Murdering devils that wear police officer suits
# Revolutionaries standing on street corners and stoops
# I'm the reason the FBI killed JFK
# The reason they have metal detectors at JFK
# The reason that the Constitution no longer protects us
# They don't even need a reason anymore to arrest us
# Living in a state of Martial Law
# Learn the arts of war
# Arm yourself, marching forth into the monster's jaws
# America eats its young, swallow raw
# Falling through the doorway of death
# Never know what we dying for
# (Chorus)
# [Ill Bill]
# I seen spoiled kids murder they parents with shotguns
# Poor kids from the hood sellin they mom's drugs
# A lost generation of fools
# Without a clear destination
# No guidance, no rules, no education
# And the older generation's no better
# Matter of fact they worse
# They oughta know better
# These greedy motherfuckers trade blood for oil
# An American graveyard on another man's soil
# Makes no sense
# The Roman Empire in the present tense
# Murder for corporations that they represent
# Whether Democrat or Republican
# The same scumbag government
# Where scumbag brains are running shit
# (Chorus)

# I'm a creator of terror berserk teens no escape from the toxic traits
# Pop ya face storm 'em with madness and blind faith
# The angel of death read between the lines out the heaven
# Expectable youth divine intervention teachin' y'all a lesson of violence
# Doctor Death injectin a virus apocalypse
# I'm a horseman in the circle of tyrants in debts for era
# Posessed like Jeff Parcera
# Consuming impulse drown you in the depths of terror forever
# Peace sells but who's buying
# Who's tryin who's crying who's lying in a pool of blood dying
# Peace sells but who's buying
# Who's tryin who's crying who's poppin with a four pound iron
# Peace sells but who's buying
# Who's tryin who's crying who's lying in a pool of blood dying

# Stranger in hell buy America day to betrayal
# Brainwashed by a system that's created to fell

# Fear factory manufacturing hi-tech hate
# A slave new world world gone mad a world without heroes
# Used to go to show surrounded by weirdos
# Lovelomoss masterin the science of war
# Read metal forces magazines dying to tour
# Power hatchets & carnivals livin their life for agony
# Where to go we got to know like Harry Flanagan

# Be afraid kill 'em to be safe
# I don't need society down for life foul & trife
# Ill Bill dirty rotten imbecil down to fight
# Give me my taxes back money god's a liar
# Speak truth to deaf americans like Tah Meraya
# Psychic vacuum jab you with a knife & stab you
# Rival this medicine try veconvictions as heroin
# Experiment macrosolutions to megaproblems
# Let the revolvers solve 'em chaos miners a cosmic drama
# Peace sells but who's buyin so I stay with the funds
# We real so you die find you laced with the slugs
# With the quickness you callin me my sacred love
# I got bad brains the reason I spray with guns now listen

# I put the motherfuckin gangsta in the game
# Destory you like cancer of the brain
# I can't be stopped
# I'm faster than the plane that crashed into the trade center
# Brain bending pain enter ya nervous system and make you wanna turn the other way
# Stick yo fuckin head in the dirt, don't even look in my direction
# You define trash, I personify perfection
# High beemin on the highway driving benzes
# Crime scene lookin like a homicide convention
# You walk around with a dick in ya mouth
# Dont ever let the kid joe take a shit in ya house
# Trust my judgement, I make bitches lie to there husbands
# At my crib on the cell phone crying they love them
# Nobodys fault, its all good as long as nobodys caught
# Jealousy, put bodys in morgues
# Hungry for money and coke, put hotties in porn
# Wont stop till I put uncle howie in forbes
# No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
# No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
# I've had my, ups and downs, dealt with cunts and clowns
# Major label deals ive been fucked around
# Spent years money dangling in front of my face
# Instead of blowin the spot, bill was runnin the place
# Payed mad dues, shows, made hundreds of tapes
# Sold drugs studio time my gun in ya face
# Look at me now, Non-Phixion running the game
# Kings of the underground and we loving it man
# Yea Ill punch you in your face when Im out on tour
# When we was with the beatnuts, I could count about four
# Different occasions I had to lace a kid, cold duffed em
# One dude bought me a drink after I snuffed em
# Promoters talk out the side of they mouth
# Till they spitten they own teeth out the side of they mouth
# Even the bouncers was scared of us, Callin for peace
# While the fagget that got his head cracked, called the police
# Ill Bill be the mother fuckin future, its easy to tell
# Fuck wit me, Ima see you in hell
# So don't fuck wit a bull, achieve the impossible
# Cause there ain't no stoppen the unstoppable
# No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
# No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
# I found your lack of faith disturbing, now my aquisitions are merging
# Streets are your, executions are murders, these goons will worship
# Like methological gods, beating impossible odds
# Comparable in the hood to killing thousands of cops
# Pass the good in the bag, take it straight to the ugly
# Made in New York, it spread now we raping the country
# Stay with the vest, triple x pistols and sex
# Money and murderers connect, equals instant success
# Ripple effect, we invest, legitimate businessmen
# Court rooms to ball rooms expanding the bussiness plan
# Listen man, I'm old fashioned
# Fuck taking over answer, kidnapp the family and hold em for ransom
# We gettin dough yawll, its the jump off
# Eather you get with us or fuck off
# An unstoppable fource on a rough course

# Coldhearted, how can a person be taught to feel?
# Thoughts concealed by shield of alcohol and pills
# [Verse 1]
# God is an atheist, why should I believe in religion?
# I'd rather get my dick sucked and cook K's in the kitchen
# Driveby, leave you on your block bleedin' and twichin'
# Break bread with demons and witches, I'm evil and twisted
# Half of us in jail, the other half in Beemers and Sixers
# CEO's wondering who let these creeps in the business
# Creep with the biscuit, I'm peril when the fiends are vendicted
# Lights the American Nightmare - the trees of the wicked
# We cry blood, sniff cocaine and die young
# Time's up, caught up in the blowjobs and mindfucks
# The metal that killed my enemys, occupy guns
# Say goodbye cause you only die once
# My minds grotesque and so ugly, so focused, so hungry
# Trust me, young Gene Simmons, get in between womans
# Ill BIll - solo album, how we gon' take it?
# Leave you ducktaped and stuck in the Matrix
# [Chorus - repeat 2X]
# Tell me where the fuck I went wrong

# Coldhearted, how can a person be taught to feel?
# Thoughts concealed by shield of alcohol and pills
# [Verse 2]
# Two women love me, one gave birth to me, nurturing
# The other one don't understand me
# Sometimes you wanna murder me, sometimes you wanna marry me
# I paid my insanity gravely, it crowd me
# I think that I'm about to go AWOL, lose my shit
# As reality slips away I'm startin to loose my grip
# No smile is genuine or real
# I find myself loosing faith in every thing and every person that I hold dear
# I'm in a bad place, so who do I trust?
# I don't trust myself, how the fuck I'm gonna trust you?
# If I don't love myself how the fuck I'm gonna love you?
# I made this album to reveale my inner thoughts and discuss truth
# What it's like, me without death
# Would you appreciate the sunlight without the darkness?
# But I appreciate my grandmother raising me cause she'd never pass away
# So many things I never had a chanse to say when she was here
# I see you when I get there
# I hope that there's a heaven even though I know I'll prolly burn in hell
# - I lived it, it couldn't get much worse I guess
# Suicidal thoughts, I think that I've become obsessed with death
# And I know it's fucked up, but yo I'm trying hard so get the fuck out o'my face
# I'll work it out myself, it's my problem, I'll solve it
# Picking up the pieces of a life shattered
# I never knew my life mattered
# [Chorus - repeat 2X]
# Tell me where the fuck I went wrong
# Took the wrong turn, wrong path

# If a picture's worth a thousand words I'll paint a thousand pictures
# If a picture's worth a thousand words I'll paint a thousand pictures
# To symbolize the decibel levels bred of a thousand whispers
# To mummify useless unknown poems spit a shower with gold glitter
# Pressure increase unleash the catacomb splitters
# And for some reason you wonder why your puzzle is a jigsaw
# When you fail to decipher the mores code to simply avoid the pitfalls
# If need be I can get raw - just pocket the latex
# But that's like asking why the man with no legs crawls to see the apex
# Or why the young planet's seeds won't blossom into a garden
# Parallel to your search for stardom where you leave breadcrumbs and jargon
# That you can't even feel. So how's that for surface tension?
# Every step shows you're a worthless henchman itching to meet your maker
# I'd rather finger-paint than take a tainted pen and curse the paper
# Voice box turns cauldron, saliva boils, then thoughts are vapor
# If seeing foremost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades
# Then a thoroughbred's accuracy isn't the focal point of perfection
# Therefore you trudge through waist-high sludge and caramelized paints where
# Prints left, taint every breath
# Inhale - golden oxygen, then step graciously over landmines shallow beneath the soil surface
# Take a small step for man and ascend a stairway to heaven on pegs
# To take a giant leap for mankind to stand and keep your legs
# What a dilemma to hold hands with
# Sanity's a steep cliff of gift
# And it seems because of your fork-tongued dreams your hands slipped
# Rip your canteen of get-rich schemes and set sail on the seven seas
# Hooker left that envy to drown in greed
# Before you swallow your pride and wash it down with a glass of formaldehyde
# I'll preserve the day the Earth fell, to symbolize how Atlas died
# I've tried to rush the wormhole to deliver a eulogy
# But the other eight planets follow me to stage a silent mutiny
# No more - dodging shooting stars
# No more - lashing of asteroid belts
# No more - avoiding supernovas and fear of android wealth
# If science and religion is the building block for a laughing stock
# Then the foundation should crumble at the epicenter of the aftershock
# The bow breaks at the vinyl spots
# The cradle of all this crime rate drops
# I've timed hate crops harvest to see if records of frisbees flop hardest
# Well that would depend on the trajectory
# And the way the projector projected me
# I was a hologram waiting for wind to inherit merit discrepancy
# Is it time for lift off?
# I think go-go gadget propellers are prepared
# Is it time for lift off?
# The rocket fuel was at peak in mid-week
# I think it's time for lift off
# The structural integrity seems to be holding
# But three astronauts were found in a cockpit falling asleep
# So will these thousand whispers ever hold a cleft note to sing?
# Or will these blisters become targets of the scorpion king's sting?
# Because the poison invades the veins to the stages of Hume
# I'll take a rain check in the same breath of a checkmate - in three moves
# I know everything is everything and nothing's still something else
# So I cleared my shelves of any signs of wealth to impress the elves
# My neck it holds bricks that weighs down my liftoff
# As a precaution I replaced the wood in the loft with something soft
# Your windows - they look clear but my pane's a stained glass
# To dampen the impression of expression anything has
# Do the hues you use, do they capture the pain my frame has?
# Or are you caught in the faces we weave, scared to changes masks?
# I'm the lawnmower man on a mission to slaughter the strange grass
# But first I must erase cyberspace and rape the track before train pass
# You strain cash
# Well I take the root of evil, make tea
# Patiently holding hands with anxiousness, I can already taste it
# There's the kettle whistle, interrupting my vision of rainbow bands
# The steam scolding my hand
# The mug shattered and I wasted it
# Now if a picture's worth a thousand words I painted a thousand pictures
# On the beautiful backdrop of butterfly kisses
# 3x
# If a picture's worth a thousand words I painted a thousand pictures
# If a scream is worth a thousand dreams I dreamed a thousand whispers
# I'll scream a thousand whispers ..

# I stand in the belly of oblivion
# seeing light strobe past me, at uncomparable speeds of rushing wind
# I take a step towards the laboreth of life
# where it's pearly gates of white perplex me
# I enter its doors of glittering ivory
# and was met by streets of gleeming gold
# that seem to lead into infinity
# curious I took the road to an unknown destination
# endured my down down the street of precious metal
# with thoughts of confusion racing though my metnal
# nevertheless I continued the journey
# looking around I noticed crowds of clouds floating through this abyss of
# beauty as if it were home
# alone I proceed to watch for any signs of life
# any signs that might give me a sense of my surroundings
# then off in the distance I notice a glowing white figure
# it would appear to be a platinum fountain gathering drink to her lips
# as I pulled closer to this vision a set of wings grabbed my attention
# to get closer, I had to, to check if this being was reality
# the nearer I got, the realer she became
# with flowing curly hair of a brownish brunette and
# I take it she felt my presence as she turned my direction
# aqua green eyes locked to mine
# as the sites of a crossbow with its target
# centuries of thoughts, epics of words were exchanged in this blare
# stare is all that came to mind
# at a loss of speech I, was standing in amazement
# now is it possible that she, is it possible that we
# is it possible that me, her, us, is inevitable
# confrontation amazing, incredible, fabolous
# though I'm human, her angelic
# (if it wasn't love I wouldn't of felt it)
# but its definietly love at second glance but first sight
# definietly love at second glance but first sight
# definietly love at second glance but first sight
# definietly love at first sight
# her left appendix was extended to grace my face with the presence of her skin
# the texture of her touch though of silk spun in the depths of Asia
# her lips plump and sweet this being completely beautiful
# from the root of her hair to the soul of her pedicure
# still my muscles were stagnant(inactive)
# I still handn't moved from the initial eyes locking so I appeared passive
# shocking fact of how attractive being of the next world
# to often I had to press girls to give me second look
# but now I'm taken it was as if she saw into my soul and I, her's
# its complexity had me perturbed(disturbed) that soceity's acceptance of her and I
# but it seemed God was okay with it, he let our paths cross
# still at a loss of words I strechd my arms just to touch her robe
# to my knees I tossed, my body to worship this godess of my resurrection
# she had to be the closest thing to next to God himself
# love like this never experienced before or ever will be again
# she's my friend that shield me from the pain and anguish of living
# never exchanged the word, our thoughts were from
# the "hello"'s to the "how are you"'s to the "I love you"'s
# she grabbed my hands, led me to the land of milk and honey
# life and prosperity, my wife she was preparing to be
# we sat in a garden of roses and other, exotic flowers
# still just exchanging thoughts as butterfly's landed on the tips of our noses
# we held hands, her beauty was overwhelming I couldn't stand to stare
# so I close my elids to rest of it
# still she was there, I felt her gental touch to the chest
# this heavenly voice spoke those three words, my heart began to race faster
# felt the touch of those lips on my cheek, open my eyes to complete darkness
# went for the lightswitch for illumination
# wondering what type of twist or turn took my situation
# to my surprise I was met by those eyes and that hair that stare, no wings
# but it wasn't a dream, it was you my love
# my earth angel, the real thing the real thing
# I know now that she, I know now that we, me, her, us, in inevitable
# confrontation amazing, incredible, fabolous
# though I'm human, her angelic
# if it wasn't love I wouldn't of felt it

# You better watch what the fuck flies outta ya mouth
# Or I'ma hijack a plane and fly it into your house
# Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch
# And slit your throat, so when you scream, only blood comes out
# I doubt that there could ever be...a more wicked MC
# 'Cuz AIDs infested child molesters aren't sicker than me
# I see the world for what it is, beyond the white and the black
# The way the government downplays historical facts
# 'Cuz the United States sponsored the rise of the 3rd Reich
# Just like the CIA trained terrorists to the fight
# Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight
# When I was a child, the Devil himself bought me a mic
# But I refused the offer, 'cuz God sent me to strike
# With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke
# My words'll expose George Bush and Bin Laden
# As two separate parts of the same seven headed dragon
# And you can't fathom the truth, so you don't hear me
# You think illuminati's just a fuckin conspiracy theory?
# That's why Conservative racists are all runnin' shit
# And your phone is tapped by the Federal Government
# So I'm jammin' frequencies in ya brain when you speak to me
# Technique will rip a rapper to pieces indecently
# Pack weapons illegally, because I'm never hesitant
# Sniper scoping a commission controllin the president

# And now the last chapters of Revelations are coming true
# And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this
# Because subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics
# But you act like America wouldn't destroy two buildings
# In a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children
# I was watching the Towers, and though I wasn't the closest
# I saw them crumble to the Earth like they was full of explosives
# And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did
# About the bombs planted on the George Washington bridge
# Four Non-Arabs arrested during the emergency
# And then it disappeared from the news permanently
# They dubbed a tape of Osama, and they said it was proof
# "Jealous of our freedom," I can't believe you bought that excuse
# Rockin a motherfucking flag don't make you a hero
# Word to Ground Zero
# The Devil crept into Heaven, God overslept on the 7th

# And just so Conservatives don't take it to heart
# I don't think Bush did it, 'cuz he isn't that smart
# He's just a stupid puppet taking orders on his cell phone
# From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone
# The military industry got it poppin' and lockin'
# Looking for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine
# And as a matter of fact, Rumsfeld, now that I think back
# Without 9/11, you couldn't have a war in Iraq

# Tax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked

# Colonialism is sponsored by corporations

# Bitches know that I'm a freak like the elephant man
# Intelligent plans
# Fuck a record deal, I want development land
# With my benevolent clan
# And that's the reason that I only trust my fam
# 40,000 records sold, 400 grand
# Fuck a middle man, I won't pay anyone else

# I'd rather be that than signed and stuck on a shelf
# And because of this executives try to diss me
# Racism frozen in time like Walt Disney
# And now they say they wanna get me signed to the majors
# If I switch up my politics and change my behavior
# Try to tell me what to rhyme about over the beat

# You ain't nothing but a motherfuckin racist bitch
# Fulla hatred, pressin a button trying to inject me
# But I ain't got no motherfuckin deal with Pepsi
# No corporate sponser telling me what to do
# Asking me to tone it down during the interview
# Tryin' to minimize the issue, but I'm keeping it large

# Fuck you (fuck you) fuck you (fuck you)
# [Verse 1]
# Basically I'm the worst nightmare you ever had
# Think of a trigger happy nigga with a badge
# Parading around Los Angeles (UH!)
# High off coke with a banana clip
# Feasting off the weak street of Angeles
# With a manuscript at professional ass whippin'
# Task force, brass knuckles a master at ass kickin'
# If you ask for it I blast for it, your back flippin'
# No one saw it, I won't stop the clock's tickin'
# Got a rookie for a partner that's ready to FIGHT niggaz
# The world's a merry-go-round of stereoTYPE niggaz
# He's the spit in the face of a pitbull and BITE niggaz
# Matter of fact, kinda like this cat for a WHITE nigga
# [Hook x1]
# [Verse 2]
# I got the projects on lock, they trust my logic
# Cause the star cops got it from guns to narcotics
# My object is to deprogram, blind your optics
# You cannot stop this mission, this topic
# Cause you can write tickets my nigga or get paid
# Learn this game in the streets and get slayed
# Collect this cheese in the end of this maze, or
# Hit the desk and fill out forms for days
# Need I remind you, how easy it'll be to take
# The city by storm with a whole force behind you?
# Shotty in the trunk and on my ankle theres a nine too
# Cause psychologically the gun you use will define you
# [Hook x1]
# [Verse 3]
# These evil streets don't sleep becareful with who you mingle
# In a city where it pays to be bilingual, cho so griefo
# No may a porta u culo (si) via ah Diablo, I'm Five-O
# Leave enemies dead on arrival, for a couple of mil'
# And you're fucking the deal up, try to play hero cop
# And you still suck, put you to bed, one in your head
# You won't feel much
# [Hook x2]
> Immortal technique
# [Verse 1]
# Yeah.... Harlem streets stay flooded in white powder
# Like those mother fuckers runnin' away from the twin towers
# Gun shots rock the earth like a meteor shower
# Bowling For Columbine, fair, giving the media power
# Innocence devoured like a chicken spot snack box
# Government cocain cooked into ghetto crack rock
# Corrupt cops false testimony at your arraignment
# Check to check, constant struggle to make the payments
# Working your whole life wondering where the day went
# The subway stays pakced like a multi-cultural slave ship
# It's rush hour, 2:30 to 8, non stoppin'
# And people coming home after corporate share croppin
# And fuck flossin, mothers are trying to feed children
# But gentrification is kicking them out of their building
# A generation of babies born without health care
# Families homeless, thrown the fuck off of the welfare
# Homicide Harldem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?
# Homicide Harldem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?
# Homicide Harldem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?
# Homicide Harldem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?
# [Verse 2]
# It's like Cambodia the killing fields uptown
# We live in distress and hang the flag upside down
# The sound of conservative politicians on television
# People in the hood are blind so they tell us to listen
# They vote for us to go to war instantly
# But none of their kids serving the infantry
# The odds are stacked against us like a casino
# Think about it, most of the army is black and latino
# And if you can't acknowledge the reality of my words
# You just another stupid mother fucker out on the curb
# Trying to escape from the ghetto with your ignorant ways
# But you can't read history at an illiterate stage
# And you can't raise a family on minimum wage
# Why the fuck you think most of us are locked in a cage
# I give niggaz the truth, cause they pride is indigent
# You better off rich and guilty than poor and innocent
# But I'm sick of feeling impotent watching the world burn
# In the era of apocalypse waiting my turn
# I'm a Harlem nigga that's concerned with the future
# And if your in my way it'd be an honor to shoot ya
# Up root ya with the evil that grows in my people
# Making them deceitful, cannibalistic and lethal
# But I see through the mentality implanted in us
# And I educate my fam about who we should trust
# Homicide Harldem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?
# Homicide Harldem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?
# Homicide Harldem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?
# Homicide Harldem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?

# [Verse 1]
# Yeah nigga, Immortal Technique, metaphysics
# The bling-bling era was cute but it's about to be done
# I leave ya full of clipse like the moon blocking the sun
# my metaphors are dirty like herpes but harder to catch
# like an escape tunnel in prison I started from scratch
# and now these parasites wanna prosenna my asscap
# trying to control perspective like an acid flashback
# but here's a quotable for every single record exec
# get your fucking hands out my pocket nigga like Malcolm X
# but this ain't a movie, I'm not a fan or a groupie
# and I'm not that type of cat, you can afford to miss if you shoot me
# curse to heavens and laugh when the sky electrocutes me
# Immortal Technique stuck in your thoughts darkening dreams
# no ones as good as good as me, they just got better marketing schemes
# I leave ya to your own destruction like sparking a fiend
# cuz you got jealousy in ya voice like star scream
# and that's the primary reason that I hate ya faggots
# I've been nice since niggaz got killed over 8-ball jackets
# and Reebok Pumps that didn’t do shit for the sneaker
# I'm a heatseaker with features that'll reach through the speaker
# and murder counter revolutionaries personally
# break a thermometer and force feed his kids mercury
# ANR's tribe jerking me thinking they call shots
# offered me a deal and a blanket full of small pocks
# your all getting shot, you little fucking tregerous bitches
# This is the business, and ya'll ain't getting nothing for free
# and if you devils play broke, then I'm taking your company
# you can call it reparations or restitution
# lock and load nigga, industrial revolution
# [Verse 2]
# I want fifty three million dollars for my collar stand
# like the Bush administration gave to the Taliban
# and fuck packing grams nigga, learn to speak and behave
# you wanna spend twenty years as a government slave
# two million people in prison keep the government paid
# stuck in a six block eight cell alive in the grave
# i was made by revolution to speak to the masses
# deep in the club toast the truth, reach for the classes
# I burn an orphanage just to bring heat to you bastards
# innocent deep in a casket, columbian fashion
# intoxicated of the flow like thugs passion
# you motherfuckers will never get me to stop blastin'
# your better off asking Ariel Sharon for compasion
# your better off banging for twenty points for a label
# your better off battling cancer under telephone cabels
# Technique chemically unstable, set to explode
# foretold by the dead sea scrolls written in codes
# so if your message ain't shit, fuck the records you sold
# cuz if you go platinum, it's got nothing to do with luck
# it just means that a million people are stupid as fuck
# stuck in the underground in general and rose to the limit
# without distribution managers, a deal, or a gimmick
# Revolutionary Volume 2, murder the critics
# and leave your fucking body rotten for the roaches and crickets
> Immortal technique
# Yea... Yea... Ay yo
# The things I've seen in life will make you choke by suprise
# Like an aborted fetus in a jar that opened it's eyes
# Provoking my demise, I'll leave your spirit broken inside
# Like the feeling of 50 million people hoping you'd die
# And niggaz wonder why my heary is filled of hatred an anger
# Cause some bitch killed my first born song with a coat hanger
# I strangled out the pain until my soul was empty was cold
# Crippled and worthless, so I thought that it could never be sold
# My mother told me that placing my faith in God was the answer
# But then I hated God cause he gave my mother cancer
# Killing us slow like the Feds did to the Blank Panthers
# The genesis of genocide is like a Pagan religion
# Carefully hidden, woven into the holidays of a Christain
# I had a vision of nuclear holocaust on top of me
# And this is prophecy, the words that I speak from my lungs
# The severed head of John the Baptist speaking in tongues
# Like "Cheke vara" my soliloquies speak to a gun
# Paint in slow motion like trees that reach for the sun
# Nigga the preaching is done cause I don't got a DJ
# Like Reverond Run, I curse the life of any man who kills
# Benevolent ones, I never asked to be the messenger
# But I was chosen to speak the words of every African slave
# Dumped in the ocean, stolen by America
# Tortured, buried, and frozen written out of the history books
# Your children are holding, internally bleeding, cold blooded
# Stripped of emotion, I go through the motions, but there's no
# Life in my eyes, it's like I'm hooked up to a respirator
# Waiting to die, hooked up to the fucking chair
# Waiting to fry, sooth an electrocution currently used
# In my execution, producing thoughts at the speed of light
# Burning confusion, I'm loosing my sight, breathing is tight
# The evening is white, I made my peace with the Lord and now I
# Stand on his right..
# Death is a another part of life..
# These are my last words, I'm having difficultly breathing
# Dying on the inside, internally bleeding
# Angel of death dragging me away while I'm sleeping
# Watching my world crumble in front of me, searching for meaning
# These are my last words, I'm having difficultly breathing
# Dying on the inside, internally bleeding
# Angel of death dragging me away while I'm sleeping
# Watching my world crumble in front of me, searching for meaning
> Immortal technique
# [Verse 1]
# They told me I would never make it, I would never achieve it
# Reality is nurishment, but people don't believe it
# I guess its hard to stomach the truth like a bulimick
# its a dirty game and nobody is willing to clean it
# But this is for the paralygics, people dreamin' of runnin'
# ladies married to men who dont please 'em, dreamin' of comin'
# urbanly murderous like David Berkowitz when I'm gunnin'
# Some cowards on the internet didn't think I would sell
# scared to talk shit in person, cuz they stuck in a shell
# and couldn't understand the pain of being stuck in a cell
# Hell is not a place you go, if you not a christian
# it's the failure of your lifes greatest ambition
# It's a bad decision to blindly follow any religion
# I don't see the difference in between the raw and the wrong
# Soldiers emptyin' the clips at little kids and they moms
# I'm just like a desperate motherfucker strapped to a bomb
# Humanity is gone, smoked up in a gravity bong
# by a democrat republican Cheech and Chong
# Immortal Technique, you never heard me preachin' a song
# I'm not controversial, I'm just speakin' the facts
# Put your hands in the air like you got the heat to your back
# and shake your body like a baby born addicted to crack
# And since life is a gamble like the crabstables at Vegas
# I freestyle my destiny, it's not written in pages
# [Verse 2]
# I hate it when they tell us how far we came to be
# as if our peoples history started with slavery
# Painfully I discovered the shit they kept us secret
# this is the exodus like the black jews out of Egypt
# I keep it reality based wit the music I make
# brought the truth to your face with the style I run wit
# like the navy missile that shot down flight eighthundred
# I'm like the africans who came here before Colombus
# and from the 15hundreds until after the model
# I watch Latin America get raped in the sorrow
# You see the spanjards never left Espace the Cologne
# and if you don't believe me, you can click on Uni Mission
# I never seen so much racism in all of my life
# every program and newscast, all of them white
# It's like a part tide with 10 percent ruling the rest
# that type of stress 'll make me put the fucking tool to your chest
# Step in my way nigga, I wouldn't wanna be ya
# I burn slow like (a) pissing drunk with gonnorrhea
# I'll do a freak show in North Korea, burning the flag
# while Jay Edgar Hoover politicians dress up in drag
# Try to confuse you, makin' it hard to follow this:
# capitalism en democracy are not synonymous
# You swallow propaganda like a birth control pill
# sellin' your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill
# But that will never be me, cuz I am leavin' the past
# like an abused wife with the kids, leavin' your ass
# Like a drug addict clean and sober, leavin' the stash
# unbreakable Technique leavin' the plane crash
# I'm out with the black box and I refuse to return
# I spit reality, instead of what you usually learn
# and I refuse to be concerned with condecending advice
# cuz I am the only motherfucker that could change my life
# Some people think I won't make it
# but I know that I will
# Escape the emptiness
# cuz that shit is slow and it kills
# the flow and the skill
# I made y'all believe that it last
# You can make the future
# but it starts with LEAVING THE PAST

# You've been drinking too much Bacardi and smoking lala
# Escuchame seÃ±orita, if you don't respect yourself

# Don't expect un hombre to support you with wealth
# Go to college and be successful, do it for delft
# Nunca vas a ser shit without knowledge your self

# That's the type of mujer that I put back on the shelf
# And go back to the pack crowd to look for somebody else
# Adios, check it
# We keep it moving properly
# No me importa lo que haces, ain't no way of stopping me

# Stop hesitaing and contemplating the way we paitient
# Start motivating and get to playing this shit we saying
# Ain't no delaying in this world that we didn't slay in
# Cause time is wasting while we stand adjacent to a razor

# [Intro: from the film "Scarface"]
# Host: I've heard whispers about the financial support
# your government receives from the drug industry.
# Guest: Well, the irony of this, of course, is that
# this money, which is in the billions, is coming from
# your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of
# our national product, which is of course cocaine.
# Host: On one hand, you're saying the United States
# government is spending millions of dollars to
# eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the
# same time, we are doing business with the very same
# goverment that is flooding our streets with cocaine.
# Guest: Mmm-hmm, si, si. Let me show you a few other
# characters that are involved  in this tragic comedy.
# [Beat starts]
# Two Men Speak in Spanish*
# [Immortal Technique - Worker]
# I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies
# Treated like a slave, the coke fields have to be ready
# The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty
# Dreaming about revolution (REVOLUTION!) looking at my machete
# But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
# And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms
# So I pray to "Heso Preisto" when I go to the mission
# Process the cocaine, paced and play my position
# [Pumpkinhead - Cocaine Field Boss]
# Ok, listen while I'm out there, just give me my product
# Before we chop off ya hands for worker's misconduct
# I got the power to shoot a copper, and not get charged
# And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
# So to feed your kids, I need these bricks
# 40 tons in total, let me test it, indeed I (*sniff*)
# Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue
# And don't worry about them, I paid off the officials
# [Diabolic - Peruvian Leader]
# Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest
# Elected by my people...the only one on the ballot
# Born and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate
# And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
# In a third-world fashion state, lock the nation
# With 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population
# The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
# The finest type of China white and cocaine you'll see
# [Tonedeff - American Drug Distributor]
# Honey I'm home, nevermind why our bank account's suddenly grown
# It's funny, we're so out of this debt from this money we owe
# Woulda ya...mind if I told you I had two governments overthrown
# To keep our son enrolled in a private school, and to keep ya tummy swollen
# C'mon, our fuckin' home was built on the foundation of bloody throats
# The hungry stolen of they souls, of course this country's runnin' coke
# I took a stunted oath to hush the one's who know
# But CIA conducts the flow of these young hustlers who lust for dough
# [Poison Pen - Drug Dealer]
# I don't work in the hood (Hit my connect)
# Plus what's really good, they supply for the hood
# These dudes fucking crack me up, scrutinize like we inferior
# Petrified when we meet in my area (calm down)
# My dude's'll shoot until I say so, got the loot?
# Give me the YAY YAY like Ice Cube, so don't play with my llello
# We won't stop for you bastards
# Must choose (?), chop it and bag it
# [Loucipher - Undercover Police Officer]
# Taking pictures and tapping phones
# Debating snitches and cracking codes
# Past a couple, blast the fo',
# Want any hustler stacking dough with probably crack the blow
# And my overtime is where your taxes go
# I gain your trust
# Get you to hand weight to us because we paid up front
# On the low with cameras taping ya
# Getting pop away? The prison sentence is going to
# Make the officer leave with two ki's out the evidence room
# [C-Rayz Walz - Prison Inmate]
# Out the evidence room (*Said with Loucipher*)
# Went my fame, truck, boat or plane, they watching you
# You think you got work? They copping too
# We control blocks, they lock countries
# Ya own companies, we had nice cars and sneaker money
# Now there's players out there, talking 'bout the holding
# With bugs in they house like they down South with windows open
# Your dough ain't long, you wrong, you take shorts and (?)
# Feds will be up in your mouth...like forks and spoons
# So enjoy the rush, live plush off Coke bread
# Soon you'll be in a cell with me, like Jenny Lopez
# In school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke
# I keep a flow on a boat for Peruvian Coke
# Players do favors for governers and tax makers
# Fat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors
# The walls got ears, you big mouths probably scared
# Not prepared to do years like Javier
# [Immortal Technique Speaking]
# The story just told is an example of the path that
# drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in
# every state of this country. It's a lot deeper than
# the niggas on your block. So when they point the
# finger at you, brother men, this is what you've got to tell them:
# [Wesley Snipes - from "New Jack City"]
# I'm not guilty. YOU'RE the one that's guilty. The
# lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords,
# all you who lobby against making drugs legal. Just
# like you did with alcohol during the prohibition.
# You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick
# the ballistics here: Ain't no Uzi's made in Harlem.
# Not one of us in here owns a poppy field. This thing
# is bigger than (Immortal Technique). This is big
# business. This is the American way.
> Immortal technique
# Big Zoo, uh
# Technique, uh
# Positive balances, uh, uh
# [Verse 1 - Big Zoo]
# Pound for pound
# I'm the most positive when I bust mine
# The Zoo adds on like a plus sign
# Addition, that's the key in the ignition
# With no pause, I propel to pole position (Vroom!)
# Ahead of the pack, light years ahead of the wack
# I give a fiend a Good Book, instead of the crack
# That's the gold mine, negativity can't hold mine
# The black bear's headed for the gold mine (look out, look out)
# And then I'm positive as Showtime
# I make negative MC's switch styles in no time
# They change teams, rhyme about kings and queens
# Instead of how they sellin' work to fiends
# Then I, switch thugs into soldiers
# Those that have given up on God to praise J Hova (Damn!)
# The rap Ice Age is over
# And positivity protects the Z boulder boulder
# [Chorus - Immortal Technique w/Big Zoo ad-libs]
# Yeah, you know how it goes, positivity, yeah
# My opinion is solid ground but your a common hater
# Splitting and dividing on numbers like a denominator
# Third-eye navigator movements are necessary
# Everything you see in videos is secondary
# You need positivity like you need respect in jail
# Because without balance you'll be making negative record sales
# Neg-neg-negative record sales, ziga-zam, Technique, like this
# [Verse 2 - Immortal Technique]
# I jerk off inside books and give life to words
# Leaving concepts stuck together you probably never heard (what?)
# I love when people think I'm psychologically disturbed
# Cause it means I overloaded their neurological nerves
# Rappers try to serve me with disgusting incompetence
# But I keep it positive with ultimate dominance
# Meditating with Native Americans close to Providence
# I speak to the spirits of ancestors at pow-wows
# But rumor has it that you getting raped like Lil' Bow Wow
# Now listen industry motherfuckers, don't get offended
# Remember, that I'll bring an end to your pretender agenda
# And render contenders dismembered, bend the fabric of time (what? what?)
# And put your soul in a blender
# You living a lie like thinking Jesus was born in December
# Instead of catering to labels, something gotta give
# I'll rip the electrons out your body and make you positive
# I seen a lot of kids come and go with marketing gimmicks
# Because without balance, you don't last more than a minute
# This ain't a game, I'll beat the shit out you at the line of scrimmage
# I rock shows in the ghetto, nigga you stuck in the village
# I wanted to spit on the radio since I was eleven
# But I can't afford the pay-ola for Hot 97's
# So I make paper underground, and I'm soon to blow
# Moving tapes like Biggie's ghost at Bad Boy studios
# Biggie - Hypnotize sample*
> Immortal technique
# The new age is upon us
# And yet the past refuses to rest in its shallow grave
# For those who hide behind the false image of the son of man
# shall stand before God!!!  It has begun
# The beginning of the end
# Yeah..
# Yeah... yeah, yeah
# [Verse 1]
# The voice of racism preaching the gospel is devilish
# A fake church called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist
# Forgetting God is not a religion, but a spiritual bond
# And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran
# They bombed innocent people, tryin' to murder Saddam
# When you gave him those chemical weapons to go to war with Iran
# This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings
# Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemmings
# I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish
# The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ
# You murdered and stole his religion, and painting him white
# Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy
# Conservative political right wing, ideology
# Glued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation
# Got my back to the wall, cause I'm facin' assassination
# Guantanamo Bay, federal incarceration
# How could this be, the land of the free, home of the brave?
# Indigenous holocaust, and the home of the slaves
# Corporate America, dancin' offbeat to the rhythm
# You really think this country, never sponsored terrorism?
# Human rights violations, we continue the saga
# El Savador and the contras in Nicaragua
# And on top of that, you still wanna take me to prison
# Just cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism
# It's like MK-ULTRA, controlling your brain
# Suggestive thinking, causing your perspective to change
# They wanna rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
# The fourth branch of the government, want us to settle
# A bandana full of glittering, generality
# Fighting for freedom and fighting terror, but what's reality?
# Read about the history of the place that we live in
# And stop letting corporate news tell lies to your children
# [Verse 2]
# Flow like the blood of Abraham through the Jews and the Arabs
# Broken apart like a woman's heart, abused in a marriage
# The brink of holy war, bottled up, like a miscarriage
# Embedded correspondents don't tell the source of the tension
# And they refuse to even mention, European intervention
# Or the massacres in Jenin, the innocent screams
# U.S. manufactured missles, and M-16's
# Weapon contracts and corrupted American dreams
# Media censorship, blocking out the video screens
# A continent of oil kingdoms, bought for a bargain
# Democracy is just a word, when the people are starvin'
# The average citizen, made to be, blind to the reason
# A desert full of genocide, where the bodies are freezin'
# And the world doesn't believe that you fightin' for freedom
# Cause you fucked the Middle East, and gave birth to a demon
# It's open season with the CIA, bugging my crib
# Trapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid
# Where nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live
# I'm tryin' to give the truth, and I know the price is my life
# But when I'm gone they'll sing a song about Immortal Technique
# Who beheaded the President, and the princes and sheiks
# You don't give a fuck about us, I can see through your facade
# Like a fallen angel standing in the presence of God
# Bitch niggaz scared of the truth, when it looks at you hard
# It's like MK-ULTRA, controlling your brain
# Suggestive thinking, causing your perspective to change
# They wanna rearrange the whole point of view in the ghetto
# The fourth branch of the government, want us to settle
# A bandana full of glittering, generality
# Fighting for freedom and fighting terror, but what's reality?
# Martial law is coming soon to the hood, to kill you
# While you hanging your flag out your project window
# Yeah..
# The fourth branch of the government AKA the media
# Seems to now have a retirement plan for ex-military officials
# As if their opinion was at all unbiased
# A machine shouldn't speak for men
# So shut the fuck up you mindless drone!
# And you know it's serious
# When these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars on a PR campaign
# To try to convince you they're fair and balanced
# When they're some of the most ignorant, and racist people
# Giving that type of mentality a safe haven
# We act like we share in the spoils of war that they do
# We die in wars, we don't get the contracts to make money off 'em afterwards!
# We don't get weapons contracts, nigga!
# We don't get cheap labor for our companies, nigga!
# We are cheap labor, nigga!
# Turn off the news and read, nigga!
# Read... read... read...
> Immortal technique
# Yeah... It's that real this time around
# Immortal Technique... Revolutionary Vol. 2
# It's on now mother fucker..
# Lock and load!
# [Verse 1]
# This is the point of no return I could never go back
# Life without parol up state shackled and trapped
# Living in the hole, lookin' at the world through a crack
# But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped
# I've gone too far, there ain't no coming back for me
# Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-B
# Just like the spanish exterminating Tynos
# Raping the black and Indian women, creating Latinos
# Mother fuckers made me out of self richeous hatered
# And you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix
# A suicide bomer strapped and ready to blow
# Lethal injection strapped down ready to go
# Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace
# Concreate jungle, guerilla war out in the streets
# Nat Turner with the sickle pitch fork and ma chatte
# The end of the world, mother fucker you not ready
# This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it
# Malcolm little running up before Elijah Muhammad
# The commedent killed the dinosaurs, changing the earth
# They love to criticize they always say I change for the worse
# Like prescription pills when you miss using them nigga
# The temple of nights when they took Jerusalem nigga
# And figured out what was buried under Soloman's temple
# Al Aksa the name is no coincidental
# I know too much to government is trying to murder me
# No coming back like cutting your writs open vertically
# How could the serpant be purposely put in charge of the country
# Genetic engineered sickness spread amongst me
# My people are so hungry that they attack without reason
# Like a fuckin' dog ripping off the hand that feeds him
# Immortal Technique is treason to the patriot act
# So come and get me mother fucker cause I'm not coming back
# This is the point from which I could never return
# And if I back down now then forever I burn
# This is the point from which I could never retreat
# Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
# This is the point from which I will die and succeed
# Living the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
# From now on it can never be the same as before
# Cause the place I'm from doesn't exist anymore
# [Verse 2]
# This is the point of no return nigga you better believe this
# Mary Magdalen giving birth to the children of Jesus
# The evolution of the world, bloody and dramatic
# Human beings killing monkeys to conquer the planet
# The kingdoms of Africa and Mesopotamia
# Machine gunnin' your body with depleated uranium
# This is the age of micro chips and titanium
# The dark side of the moon and contact with aliens
# I started out like Australians, criminal minded
# Broke into hell, tore it down, and built and city behind it
# South Paul, murderous, methadology nigga
# Remember that I'm just a man don't follow me nigga
# Cause once you past the point you can never go home
# You've got to face the possibility of dying alone
# So tell me mother fucker, how could you die for the throne?
# When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own
# It rains acid, one day the earth will cry from a stone
# And you'll be lookin' at the world livin' inside of a dome
# Comperized humanity living inside of a clone
# This is the place where the unknown is living and real
# Worm went to planet X and the seventh seal
# Universal truth is not measure in mass appeal
# This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky
# Cause almost everything that I was always ever told was a lie
# This is the point from which I could never return
# And if I back down now then forever I burn
# This is the point from which I could never retreat
# Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
# This is the point from which I will die and succeed
# Living the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
# From now on it can never be the same as before
# Cause the place I'm from doesn't exist anymore
> Immortal technique
# [Verse 1]
# She was on her way to becoming a college graduate
# Wouldn't even stop to talk to the average kid
# The type of latina I'd sit and contemplate marriage with
# Fuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire
# Disciplined, intellectual beauty's what I desire
# Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez
# Everyone told me, kickin' it to her was hopeless
# At first I just thought, she didn't mess with broke kids
# The thug niggaz always talking about, how they smoke kids
# But the rich-sniff-coke kids got no play
# "I'm not even interested" is what her body language would say
# Everyone around the way, gave up trying to get in it
# It didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it
# On the block, bitches was jealous, but wouldn't admit it
# Talk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it
# 'Cause they regreted the long list of niggaz that they let hit it
# And no one ever gave them shit except McDonald's and did-dick
# Smoking weed with thoughts of envy, whenever they lit it
# She smoked intelligently and they bit it, always trying to copy
# But when they tried to use her vocab, they sounded sloppy
# She had a style, all her own, respectful and pure
# I was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure
# [Hook - Jean Grae]
# Don't you know that, time waits for no man
# Not fate, it's all planned
# I'm blessed just to know you
# I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night
# Can't find, a reason why
# God came, to you and I
# If I had the chance again, I'd never let you go
# Hold tight to your love, 'cause you never know
# [Verse 2]
# Her eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad
# I used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad
# That I wasn't just another nigga trying to get in it
# So every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute
# I didn't have a gimmick so the minutes turned to hours
# On her birthday, I gave her a poem with flowers
# Then I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower
# We talked about, power to the people and such
# We spent more time together but it was never enough
# I never tried to sneak a touch, or even cop a feel
# I was too interested, in keeping it real
# Perfectly honest and complete, she would always call me "carino,"
# And never Technique, bought me a new book to read every 2 or 3 weeks
# Forever changing the expression of my thoughts when I speak
# It was because of her, I even deaded all of my freaks
# She convinced me, to stop hangin' out on the streets
# To stop robbin' and stealin', from people like you
# Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronxu
# We sailed in Barrio (?) and the Metropolitan too
# Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew
# So I decided one day, to tell her my feelings was true
# I couldn't live without her so I told her, facing my fears
# But honey's only response, was a face full of tears
# She could only sob hysterically, holding me tight
# I tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sight
# I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light
# Except I didn't burn, I turned cold after that night
# [Verse 3]
# I went on with my life, college and my career
# Ended up locked up like an animal for a year
# Where the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseer
# Then I got sent to the hole, when my exit was near
# At night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her
# Hold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared
# Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole in the summer
# came back, in tact and on track
# But the fact of the matter, is I still felt cold
# Even after my mother, hugged me, cryin' at home
# My real niggaz would catch me thinkin', out of my zone
# Fuckin' lots of different women, but I still felt alone
# Relatively well-known around the New York underground
# But I kept thinking of her and how we used to be down
# The sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair
# Though gone physically, somehow it was still there
# I had to do something, because the shit was too much to bear
# So I went and visited the building where she used to live
# The world looks a lot different after you do a bid
# The way your life done changed
# While primitive minds (are) still stuck in the same game
# Like her cousin who was on the corner slangin' cocaine
# Stepped in the lobby and tapped the button next to her last name
# Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up, like a mother oughta
# But her facial expression changed, when I asked about her daughter
# [Verse 4]
# She told me that there was a note for me, that was left behind
# She had left it there waiting, for such a long time
# I was inclined to ask about it but she brought it up first
# I saw a tear swelling up in her eye, and then she cursed
# She told me where the letter was and I started thinking the worst
# Reversed my position, stepped over and opened the door
# And sure enough there was an envelope with my name on the floor
# "Nobody loves you more than me carino" is what the letter said
# "By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be dead
# But when you left in '97 a part of me went to Heaven
# I thank God at least I got to know what love really was
# But it hurt me, to see what true love really does
# 'Cause even though we never made love, you were all that there was
# It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave
# You made me doubt the way I thought, you made me want to believe
# And then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me
# It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me
# This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be
# Baby don't you see, I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV
# Hoped the end exists for me since late in 1993
# I died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to you
# I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you
# Promise that you'll meet me in paradise inevitably
# No matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me"
# What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur
# But I remember wishing that I was dead, instead of her
# She was buried on August 3rd
# The story ends without a sequel
# And now you know why Technique, don't fucking fall in love with people
# Hold the person that you love closely if they're next to you
# The one you love, not the person that'll simply have sex with you
# Appreciate them to the fullest extent, and then beyond
# 'Cause you never really know what you got, until it's gone

# He said "Young, whatever you do just, make sure you strike twice"
# I was a little bit nervous about being my first time
# But I said "What the hell this girl is too damn fine"
# My very first time
# In the house, in the couch, in your parents' bedroom remember
# My very first time
# Wait 'til the day when I see you again remember
# My very first time
# It was just that special to me that it was to you girl
# My very first time
# Will never forget my first time
# See it was sunday afternoon, mom and pop were gone
# We have to be on the low cuz they were on their way home
# We started kissing then laid straight up to the bed
# Can't believe this is happenin' is what I'm thinking in my head
# Last like a minute but I'd say like forever
# We almost got caught but I'm just too damn clever
# Your parents came home, judging I was a little ? drop of ?
# Man I will never forget my first time
# This goes out to the first do you know when will I see you again (see you again)
# And no matter how all people've get no regrets I will never forget
# My first time
# My very first time
# In the house, in the couch, in your parents' bedroom remember
# My very first time
# Wait 'til the day when I see you again remember
# My very first time
# It was just that special to me that it was to you girl
# My very first time
# Will never forget my first time
# See some of you might have started early but some of you started late
# But I know when I started I thought it was great
# This goes out to all my little brothers in the world
# Make sure your first time's with that special girl
# Clap your hands if you remember (clap your hands)
# your first time (first time), your first time (first time)
# Clap your hands (clap your hands with me)
# if you remember your first time (your first time), your first time baby
# [Chorus: (x2)]
# My very first time
# In the house, in the couch, in your parents' bedroom remember
# My very first time
# Wait 'til the day when I see you again remember

# Yeah I’m so tired of seeing you like this
# All stressed out, don’t know what to do
# I know, I’m everything that you want and you need
# So why you staying with him
# When you need to be with me
# Ya know, well hey listen up
# What did he do?
# What did he say?
# To make you feel this way
# No way, no how
# He didn’t love you in the first place
# (He didn’t love you, no, no, no)
# He must have been foolish
# To let a love like yours slip away
# So wonderful and so beautiful
# He would never know, oh no, oh no
# 1 - What would it take to make you leave?
# Cause he’s not really what you need
# So go on and tell him that you wanna be with me
# You’re going in and out of love
# Know you had about enough
# So now I don’t know what to do
# Cause I’m so in love with you
# Girl don’t you know
# Come on and let me take your hand
# Let me take you far away from him
# You say your tired of him so try my love
# You say you want a real man well I’m the one
# He broke your heart, say bye
# Girl you need to be with me
# Cause I’m all you’ll ever need
# Repeat 1
# Don’t you know you need a man?
# Someone who cares and understands
# Girl you don’t need that other man
# Cause I’m everything you’ll ever need
# Girl don’t you know he puts you down
# So tell him that you want me now
# He broke your heart, say goodbye
# Repeat 1

# Hey now ladies guess who's back
# LDB, Romeo, and Bat
# For the 99, it's phat stack
# Yo Ra-Ra about to rip the track
# You took my heart and ran with it
# Why you so damn scandalous?
# I found a chick who could handle this
# Bye-bye love cause I'm through with this
# Oh my God, what'd I do?
# I'm caught up in your game with you
# My best friend's girl, what a shame
# Why did you play these silly games?
# Try to put the blame on me
# I always knew you were a freak
# I seen you looking right away
# Girl you've got a bomb body
# 1 -  I should've seen it coming when you stepped to me
# You're like my sis never thought it would be
# But there was something that you did when you looked at me
# That made me wanna get a little bit freaky
# Then I started thinking about my boy, he said
# What would he do if he knew?
# His homie was creeping with you
# 2 -  Keep it on the low
# We never should've did it
# Yo girl, my best friend
# He can never know
# Get up and get your stuff girl, you must go
# Keep it on the low
# We never should've did it yo girl, my best friend
# He can never know, oh, oh, oh
# Oh no can't talk to you
# Take it to the source what I can not do
# Gotta stop, cause every night
# All of this stuff ain't worth the fight
# My homie comes first that's how it goes
# Can't keep dealing with you silly hoes
# Buying your stuff and playing the role
# Baby I don't need you, no, no
# Repeat 1
# Repeat 2
# Isn't that your curiosity
# Doesn't mean a thing to me
# As I reach for the sky
# There's no need for me to lie
# Cause my love for him is strong
# I must hold on
# Immature come on dance with me
# Romeo, Batman, LDB
# Everybody come on dance with me
# Yeah, come on, come on, dance with me

# The image I project - me without me
# The picture that I scanned is borrowed
# After the education you stopped making sense to me
# Seems to me that it's all the same, time and time again
# Slowly, all that I believed in, turning into a lie
# To aim and miss, my supernatural art
# Spending to much time with myself
# Trying to explaining who I am
# How come it's possible
# I wish there was a way
# (Suddenly) I feel so invincible
# I'm the sculpture made out of clay
# I need someone to break the silence
# before it all falls apart
# I need something to cling onto
# before I break you in parts
# So afraid of what you may think
# And all the plastic people that surrounds me
# I have to find the path to where it all begins

# So impressed, lost the faith in all I had
# Broken down, I'm on my way to be dissolved
# The hopes and prays of things to come
# I've lost them all with glory
# Urgent to aim for that short-lived joy
# I see gold in all that lies before me
# And so we ignore the baggers cup
# Praise your act in the Grand Finale
# Teach the unborn the winners sign

# A decade ago, I never thought I would be,
# At twnety-three, on the verge of spontaneous combustion.
# Woe-is-me.
# But I guess that it comes with the territory,
# An omnious landscape of never-ending calamity.
# I need you to hear, I need you to see
# That I have had all I can take and
# Exploding seems like a definate possibility to me.
# So pardon me while I burst into flames.
# I've had enough of this world and it's people's mindless games.
# So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame.
# Pardon me, pardon me... I'll never be the same.
# Not two days ago, I was having a look in a book
# And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knees.
# I said, "I can relate," cause lately I'vebeen thinking of combustion
# As a welcomed vacation from the burdens of the planet Earth.
# Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D...
# And thinking so much differently.
# So pardon me while I burst into flames.
# I've had enough of this world and it's people's mindless games.
# So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame.

# Brown skin, you know I love your brown skin
# I cant tell where yours begins, I cant tell where mine ends
# Brown skin, up against my brown skin
# Need some every now and then…oh hey…
# Brown skin, you know I love your brown skin
# I cant tell where yours begins, I cant tell where mine ends
# Brown skin, up against my brown skin
# Need some every now and then…oh hey…

# You’re like a cool breeze, on a summer’s day
# You are a river running through the desert plain
# You are my shelter, from the pouring rain
# You were my comfort, even before the pain
# I can hear the sound of five drummers in the wind
# The leaves blowing in the breeze, ring out like guitars
# A tin can rolls across the gravel like a tambourine
# I am but a vessel, so I sing, because you are
# Chorus In my head, you’re always in my head
# In my dreams, you’re always in my head
# In my pain, you’re always in my head
# In my peace, you’re always in my head
# A rainbow of rhythm stretches across the sky
# An airplane in the distance, plays a beautiful cello line
# It’s no coincidence; it’s in tune with the music in my head
# If you were a shoulder you’re where I would rest, but I am your vessel so I hear, you
# Chorus
# In my head,you’re always in my head
# In my fears,you’re always in my head
# In my joy,you’re always in my head
# In my tears, you’re always in my head
# You’re like a cool breeze, on a summer’s day
# You are a river, running through a desert plain
# You’ve been my shelter, from the pouring rain
# You were my comfort, even before the pain…’cause I hear you
# Chorus
# In my head, you’re always in my head
# In my dreams, you’re always in my head
# In my pain, you’re always in my head
# In my peace, you’re always in my head
# Chorus
# In my head,you’re always in my head
# In my fears, you’re always in my head
# In my joy, you’re always in my head

# Been around the whole world, still ain’t seen
# Nothin’ like my neighborhood
# And of all the fancy satin and silk
# My white cotton feels so good
# Searched high and low for a place
# Where I can lay my burdens down
# Ain’t nothin’ in the whole wide world
# Like the piece that I have found
# (It’s the little things) It’s the little things
# And the joy they bring
# (The little things) It’s the little things
# And joy they bring
# As simple as a phone call just to make it known
# That you’re gonna be a little late
# Pure as a kiss on a cheek in a word
# That everything will be okay
# Call in the mornin’ from my little sister
# Singin’ to me, "Happy Birthday"
# In the quest for fortune and fame
# Don’t forget about the simple things
# (It’s the little things) It’s the little things
# And the joy they bring, yeah
# (The little things) It’s the little things
# And joy
# Give me some roomful, give me seclusion
# Give me some peace of mind
# Bring me some sunshine, bring me some blue sky
# Runnin’ ‘round in circles, lost my focus
# Lost sight of my goal
# I do this for the love of music
# Not for the glitter and gold
# Got everything that I pray for
# Even a little more
# When I ask to learn humility
# This is what I was told
# (It’s the little things) It’s the little things
# And the joy they bring, it’s the little things
# (The little things) It’s the little things
# Oh...hee...
# Give me my guitar, bring me a bright star
# Give me new clothes, give me some cute shoes
# Give me a ladder, give me some matter

# Pour me some sweet tea, spoonful of honey
# I don’t need no Hollywood

# Verse
# Hey baby
# Why you rushing
# Let’s sit back and watch the flowers grow
# Why you want
# To swim against the tide
# Let’s lay and watch the river flow
# Here in god’s creation
# There is always a reason
# I know, that love is there for us
# Yeah
# Chorus
# Where we’ll go, baby I don’t know
# Maybe we should just let nature run the show
# Where we’ll go, baby I don’t know
# Maybe we should just let nature run the show
# Verse
# I don’t wanna watch no movie
# Let’s sit and watch the stars put on a show
# If you want to win my favor
# Be creative, and show me your flavor
# Cause here in god’s creation
# For everything there is a session
# Let go Let life
# Let love let god
# Chorus
# Where we’ll go, baby I don’t know
# Maybe we should just let nature run the show
# Where we’ll go, baby I don’t know
# Maybe we should just let nature run the show
# Bridge
# Like the sun shines and
# The wind blows
# Like the birds fly
# And the moon glows
# If I am meant for you and
# You are meant for me
# Then we will flow together
# Everlastly
# Chorus x2
# Where we’ll go, baby I don’t know
# Maybe we should just let nature run the show
# Where we’ll go, baby I don’t know
# Maybe we should just let nature run the show
# Out
# Baby we should sit, watch the flowers grow
# Baby we should sit, back and watch the moon glow
# Baby, we should feel the wind blow
# First you plant a seed
# And then it grows and
# Then it blooms
# And it dies
# That the cycle of life
# Same goo’s for you and I
# Maybe this time we’ll get it right
# Go with the flow
# Maybe we’ll get it right..

> India Arie
# When I think about the turn my life has taken
# I know it’s because of you, that I receive so many blessings
# I had a home but no privacy, I didn’t know a thing about my legacy
# When I realized you were there for me, I called on your name and you came
# And you did, just what you said, for that I’ll love you forever
# You kept, your word to me, for that I’ll love you forever
# Chorus
# A promise, is a promise in my eyes
# Can’t say you’re gonna just to compromise
# The very thing that keeps two hearts intertwined
# A promise is a promise you can’t deny, there’s no way
# I think of when there was a young boy, not even two years old
# Blessed with a mother who loved him so, she abandoned her dreams to nourish his own
# It wasn’t easy for the two of them, but she knew she had to give him a chance
# At a better life, it was only right, so she worked and she prayed
# And she did, just what she say, for that he’ll love her forever
# She kept her word to him, for that he’ll love her forever
# Chorus
# A promise is a promise, in my eyes
# Can’t say you’re gonna just to compromise
# The very thing that keeps two hearts intertwined
# A promise is a promise you can’t deny, there’s no way
# A man’s only as good as his word
# Instrumental break
# Her wedding day and she’s thinking ‘bout the way he won her affection
# She was so cynical about love ‘cause she didn’t want to be heart broken again
# He looked her in her eye with sincerity, said he only wanted to protect her so she
# Took a chance on him and she’s glad she did because he came for real
# And he did, just what he said, for that she’ll love him forever
# He kept his word to her, for that she’ll love him forever
# Chorus
# A promise is a promise, in my eyes
# Can’t say you’re gonna just to compromise
# The very thing that keeps two hearts intertwined
# A promise is a promise you can’t deny, there’s no way
# No way, there ain’t no way
# A man’s only as good as his word

# I am ready for love
# Why are you hiding from me
# I’d quickly give my freedom
# To be held in your captivity
# I am ready for love
# All of the joy and the pain
# And all the time that it takes
# Just to stay in your good grace
# Lately I’ve been thinking
# Maybe you’re not ready for me
# Maybe you think I need to learn maturity
# They say watch what you ask for
# Cause you might receive
# But if you ask me tomorrow
# I’ll say the same thing
# I am ready for love
# Would you please lend me your ear?
# I promise I won’t complain
# I just need you to acknowledge I am here
# If you give me half a chance
# I‘ll prove this to you
# I will be patience, kind, faithful and true
# To a man who loves music
# A man who loves art
# Respect’s the spirit world
# And thinks with his heart
# I am ready for love
# If you’ll take me in your hands
# I will learn what you teach
# And do the best that I can
# I am ready for love
# Here with a offering of
# My voice
# My Eyes
# My soul
# My mind
# Tell me what is enough
# To prove I am ready for love
# I am ready…

# Inside my head there lives a dream that I want to see in the sun
# Behind my eyes there lives a me that I’ve been hiding for much too long
# ‘Cause I’ve been, too afraid to let it show
# ‘Cause I’m scared of the judgment that may follow
# Always putting off my living for tomorrow
# It’s time to step out on faith, I’ve gotta show my faith
# It’s been illusive for so long, but freedom is mine today
# I’ve gotta step out on faith, It’s time to show my faith
# Procrastination had me down but look what I have found, I found
# Chorus
# Strength, courage, and wisdom
# And it’s been inside of me all along,
# Strength, courage, and wisdom
# Inside of me
# Behind my pride there lives a me, that knows humility
# Inside my voice there is a soul, and in my soul there is a voice
# But I’ve been, too afraid to make a choice
# ‘Cause I’m scared of the things that I might be missing
# Running too fast to stop and listen
# It’s time to step out on faith, I’ve gotta show my faith
# It’s been illusive for so long but freedom is mine today
# I’ve gotta step out on faith it’s time to show my faith
# Procrastination had me down but look what I have found, I found

# It’s been inside of me all along,

# [Verse I]
# See my paps, the nigga had to be a rolling stone
# Whereever he laid his head, had to be his home
# Cause by time I was three he was gone
# I had to move on stay strong for my moms
# We moved to the block 1976
# About that time I was three, a little kid
# Came from BedStuy but I rep Queensbridge
# Riverpark ??? made the kid what I is
# Seein' Marley Marl, Hot Day, DJ Twinz
# Had a joint jump when the record start to spin
# MC Shan, R-Kim, Flash and Biz
# Coldless n' Tragedy n' Superkid was my shit
# I couldn't count all the drugs I sold in my hand
# Know all the times that I could've been dead
# Shah stare blocked up and chill doin' biz
# My mother never told me there'll be things like this, why?
# Let's take it back to 8-Tracks and Cadillacs
# Diamond in the back on the block selling crack
# Take it back, way back, when P had a black acc
# About '95 when we first started to rap in fact
# Take it back, I had hoes on the tracks
# See I been there and tapped my favourite joint was the mac
# Click-Clack, take it back, when I was a little kid
# All the hard times growing up, bit after bit
# [Verse II]
# As I go in deep thought about how I came up
# My pops was never there on none of my birthdays
# On know holidays but I loved him anyway
# God bless his soul, I know how shit go
# Nobody's perfect you feel me, bro?
# It was just me and my brother, my mother was like my father
# She told us right from wrong always stay strong
# No matter the situation just have patience
# Eventually you will achieve your goal
# Whatever you do, be the best at it
# I ran with her words and wisdom they ran at it
# Topspeed mind, no success and checks
# My kids and my clikk, flock the bullshit
# It's money to get, rappers nowadays
# They frontin like their rich, floassin' and flashin'
# That shit don't impress me you feel me, dun?

# Yo, the name in this book is called "shit never changed"
# Guaranteed if you read it, you never feel the same
# It was around '79 when we moved to the hood
# Young ass girl with 4 kids and one in the oven
# I ain't really had no fam, just my aunt and cousins
# Thanks to free lunchs without that a nigga be buggin'
# I remember my mother's voice, fussin' and cussin'
# On the welfareline collecting them stamps
# And thanks to the hood, they made me who I am
# A hustler, know how to get what I need
# Make sure I'm good with somewhere to sleep
# Since a little kid times been tough
# Pumpin' cracks at 12 times been rough
# Hoes in my shoes, who gives a fuck?
# One thing on my mind is making those bucks
# Slit, get clapped up and press your luck, what?

# I was bruised in this game that's why I stay with them tools

# I had a deal over at Virgin, but they dropped the kid
# How come, I don't know, they wasn't feelin' the kids
# Or the music to hot for their ears to list'
# Back to square one it's all good, it ain't gon' stop a nigga
# Like have me do something stupid like go and pop a nigga
# It's a movie and I'mma be the star of this shit

# It's all gravy, Queensbridge roll like the Navy
# Little girls runnin' around havin' mad babies
# [Chorus: Havoc]
# Yo, ya'll don't a give a yeah, we don't give a yeah

# Violate, get your face carved in
# Fuckin' with these Queensbridge marksmen
# Never go against our grain, twenty tats, ball head cat, rep QB
# See me on the stage iced out, laced up
# Hazed up, jumping in them big ass trucks
# When we shoot you better duck, you out of luck young'n

# Livin’ in fear, livin’ here, livin’ hopeless with every day
# Of my life, feelin’ stressed out, tryin’ to figure out
# The best rhymes you left out

# ‘Cause they never really know now what you goin’ through
# They see no accomplishments, smile, then they compliment you

# It’s real and y’all can’t understand the way I feel

# Sold my soul to the billers, heck no
# Let it go, here I come, chest blow
# So for sure to the door, let’s go
# I feel like niggas wanna ride for me
# I feel like niggas wanna die for me
# I feel like niggas wanna lie to me
# All these niggas wanna feel the 380
# Never take no when the jake low
# I woke up screamin’, Yeah-Yo"
# All these niggas wanna kill say so
# Dollar bill, dollar bill, I’mma make more
# Try the bill, try the bill, I’mma take yours
# Here I go, here I come on the run

# Bust out with somethin' that you never see

# To save me from the things that I can't see
# You can't refuse what I'm giving

# Maybe her eyes are just a little bit red

# She's almost perfect
# She is so close to being everything
# She's almost perfect
# But she's not, she's not mine
# Maybe she knows she drives me crazy
# Just bats her eyes like she's my baby
# Maybe she's quick to let her tongue fly at me
# She's not the most proper lady
# I'm the one to blame I know I caused this crash
# So now I wander in this mess

# I looked out this morning and the sun was gone

# (more than a feeling)
# I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
# 'till I see Marianne walk away

# Their faces fade as the years go by
# Yet I still recall as I wander on
# as clear as the sun in the summer sky
# It's more than a feeling, when I hear that old song they used to play
# (more than a feeling)
# I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
# 'till I see Marianne walk away
# I see my Marianne walkin' away
# When I'm tired and thinking cold
# I hide in my music, forget the day
# and dream of a girl I used to know
# I closed my eyes and she slipped away
# She slipped away She slipped away.

# So there I was watching Sanford and Son, working the graveyard shift. At a party store, rolling a spliff. I'm behind the
# glass I see crackheads all night. But tonight the moon is red and sh** ain't felling right. My first sight was a basehead
# trying to break into my car. In plain view too, I ran out with a crowbar hammered it upside his cranium, he fell over
# dead, but no blood, only dust, he's a f***ing basehead. Here comes another one jumping out of a tree, but I ain't even
# have to move, he missed by like 20 feet. He slammed down on the pavement, I quicked started kicking. Beat him with the
# crowbar 'til he finally stopped twitching. Look behind me, seen another zombie in the register. I'm use to shooting em off
# from begging from the customers, but now I gotta reach up under the seat and grab the hand-ax. Whipped it from there and
# stuck it into his back.

# Goddamnit. It's 2 more in the cooler once in the back of the store. Pull my hand-ax out that back and then attack him
# some more. I charged, but he busted me in the head with a pepsi. No effect, I left him shaking on the floor epilepsy. With
# Their necks severed, f***ing zombies for rocks. Another jumped on my back and we went thru the glass into the parking
# lot. He tried to kill me, he told me 'Gimmie Some Change!' All digging in my ear for it and sh**...Deranged! I grabbed him
# by his head and tired to yank it to the left to break his neck, but his head spun all the way around and that was f***ing
# it. I was outta there, I seen another coming out of the Grave. Zombies, begging for change!!! I'm f***ing swinging at em.

# I tried to visit Shaggy, I stepped up off of my porch
# And it was dark as fuck I couldn't see, not even with a torch
# I hear the streets talkin', and they aware of my move
# They whisperin' and swingin' from the trees, above I hear the loons
# I try to jog a little, crow eyes glow like cats
# Demonic zombies runnin' up on me, I slap 'em with the bat
# But my eyes keep bleedin' from the rays of the darkness
# They powerful and burn you somethin heartless (uh!)
# I hear a giant thumpin', some kind of ogre or somethin'
# I see the phantom screamin' as this giant behemoth is comin'
# And it swung at me, I felt a rip my head went spinnin'
# And flippin' and rollin' and finally landed in position
# I could see my body still standin', headless as fuck
# It finally fell but what the hell, still got my nugget but I'm stuck
# I can't move fuck I'm only a face, why even try?
# On top of that, it's a centipede crawlin' in my eye
# I wanna die..

# Everyday I die
# Back to the start, another try
# I got the time so why should't I?
# [Violent J]
# I got too much time on my hands
# [Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]
# I tried to visit J, I walked out into the cold
# I see they don't collect they dead, they all up over the road
# And some are fully rotted, and some they must've just spotted
# I seen a headless body that resembles J's, but I doubt it
# I seen a centaur, I threw a pitch fork at it above
# I watch it fall into a bloody patch of bodies and blood
# I'm fuckin' 'bout to hurl, I close my eyes and walk on
# It's giant crows swoopin at me, got me carry me on
# I cut it's claws with the hatchet that I keep in my hand
# Even in Hell, you best believe I keep the hatchet in my hand
# And as I'm fallin' now, I see the Witch is ridin' my chest
# With its claws on my neck, screamin' I should've confessed
# I slammed down into an iron gate, a demon statue near me
# Four points stickin' out my chest, I'm hangin' there dearly
# And the hungry goblins, they got a fire beneath me
# They cookin' my legs, to make myself eat me
# I wanna die..

# 2:45 and the bell went off,
# Thank God,
# Many people think im odd
# But i talk with no one,
# And i walk alone,and i avoid sunlight with a chalky tone
# I get home and dont say hi,
# It aint no onw there,
# I dont care I walk in and go right up the stairs
# To my room
# Get in bed and just wait for dark cause thats when the real show starts (tap tap)
# 'tap tap' on the glass go the piece of ass'
# So young and pretty its too bad she past
# But she comes to my room and we talk at night,she's demonic and bloody,but she holds me tight
# In my bedroom,with her im never alone,and i kiss her cold lips until morning comes
# Then she gone,
# I can still hear her voice loom.
# But she only exists in the dark of my room
# [chorus: x2]
# Love...
# (i cant ignore you)
# In my room
# (do anything for you)
# Love...
# (i do adore you)
# In My Room...
# You and I
# I try to smile alot,but im always frontin,but i do love a ghost and atleast thats something.
# She dont talk much,
# When she do it get cold,
# Usually we just lay there and we hold each other, we're lovers we dont need others,
# One of my mother's cats jumped up on the covers
# And it scared my baby guess she dont like pets so i twisted its f***in head off at the neck
# Look baby,
# Its gone its doomed please come back to the room i do anything for thy, dont ignore me this is more than a sick love story
# W/o you id bring a shotgun to school and i will if you want me to for any reason
# I hate that u leave when the lights come on and if i had it my way the f***in sun would be gone!
# [chorus x2]
# Sometimes i kiss her and i start shakin,she slips me the tongue and it taste like bacon.
# Uh oh somethings wrong baby's upset
# She told me she was spotted by the neigbors kid
# She cant come back now cause they know our secret
# Uless i can make thenm keep it.
# If i do she may come to life now in their yard with a shotgun and knife
# Cut the screen
# Went in and found the kid
# Blew a bowl of spaghetti in the side of his head,the daddy was nextrunnin down the hall,i shredded his throat and he was
# Quick to fall,tossed themossberg and gripped the knife,started stabin the sh** out of his wife,
# Went home a bloody mess with a job well done.
# Wash up and wait for my baby to come

# You don't know the half
# So I'm waitin in the line with my pad and pen
# I finally got up to the bitch and he had a grin
# He said that he watches me and I'm a disgrace
# So I reach for the nine and shot him in his spine
# All the kiddies runnin, screamin and cryin

# "Oh, I'm so lonely around christmas, I miss Santa Claus.
# He won't come to my house, I wonder if he's scared.

# Santa I'm coming to see you. Merry Christmas."
# It's Christmas Eve
# Another time to deceive
# I got another trick up my sleeve
# He won't leave
# I just wait tic-toc-ticky
# Somebody told me fuck Saint Nickie
# Nick, prick north pole hick

# Sounds like Rudolph and the whole click
# It's time for some down with the clown G shit

> Intocables
# Siento un vacio que va
# ahogandome una vez mas
# te quema el aire en la piel
# y vivir me da igual.
# Me duele tanto saber
# Me duele solo pensar
# que moriremos asi y de igual forma te vas
# tus palabras me pueden mentir
# tu mirada jamas.
# Contra viento y marea
# y tal vez contra el mundo
# luchare con quien sea
# sin dudar un segundo
# con todo el corazon
# a matar o morir
# Contra viento y marea por estar junto a ti.
# Llevo un silencio que da
# la sensacion de gritar
# tengo la mente en tu voz
# que pide nunca olvidar
# tus palabras me pueden mentir
# tu mirada jamas
# Contra viento y marea
# y tal vez contra el mundo
# luchare con quien sea
# sin dudar un segundo
# con todo el corazon
# a matar o morir
# "CONTRA VIENTO Y MAREA POR ESTAR JUNTO A TI"
# CON UN SUEÑO QUE PIDE
# CON MI FE QUE TE SIGUE
# Y CON TODO EL AMOR
# (coro)
# Con todo el corazon
# a matar o morir
# Contra viento y marea por estar junto a ti.
# JUNTO A TI
> Intrigue
# She's the kind of girl
# Who can take your world
# And spin it around
# (Uh, oh)
# And she's the kind of girl
# Who can take your heart
# And turn it upside down
# (Oh yeah)
# And it doesn't really matter the place or the time
# I come alive when I look in her eyes
# It's something I just can't explain
# Chorus:
# If you've ever been in love
# You know what I'm feelin tonight
# You know when the feelin is right
# That one special girl
# She makes all your dreams come to life
# And if you've ever been in love
# You cherish the moments you spent
# You know you can always depend
# On your special girl
# Hoping the dream doesn't end
# Just the way she smiles in the morning
# Gets me through another day
# (Sha la la la la la la)
# And the minutes turn to hours
# Every time she goes away
# (Sha la la la la la la)
# She's the one that I need, and I can't do without
# I realize, now what love's what all about
# I'd give her the moon, and the stars
# But all that she wants is my heart
# Repeat Chorus
# (Instrumental)
# And it doesn't really matter the place or the time
# I come alive when I look in her eyes
# It's something I just can't explain
# It happens again and again
# Repeat Chorus (2x)
# If You've Ever Been In Love (4x)

# Some of us made of concrete
# Some of us made of sand
# Some of us like the clear blue water
# Others catching it in their hands
# But we'll all just fade
# Some of us made of steel
# Some of us like the earth
# Some of us are the clear blue sky
# When others fly through the air
# But we'll all just fade so is it
# Better to say
# Chances are what you feel
# Is like everyone else
# Who is wrong?
# What is real?
# You can ask yourself
# But if you find a way
# You can always carry on
# Chances are what you need
# Is like everyone else
# It's in you, it's in me
# You can see yourself
# But if you find a way
# You can always carry on
# Some of us breaking like ice
# Some of us like a stone
# Some are just like the blowing wind
# Others always are getting thrown
# Bridge - chorus
# And when you say you won't make tomorrow
# Cause tomorrow feels like the rest
# Yeah you can break this viscous circle
# Everyone who hurts feels no less
# Some of us like a secret
# Some of us open books
# And some you can tell but either way
# You can't tell by just a look
# Then we all just fade anyway
> Invertigo
# When I reach out, you move away from my hands
# You're never telling me why
# We make time to spend
# Time you forget and the days are just passing us by
# When I ask you, you never understand it
# You don't know what you haven't done
# And when I try to explain it sounds like complaints
# And the words only make you more numb
# Is there a fire if you don't see the smoke?
# We can't get higher if you don't let it go.
# Chorus :
# Ooh Ooh Ooh
# How did your heart ever get like that
# How did someone ever hurt so bad
# That you can't see it
# You've been kicked inside
# You're desensitized yeah
# Oooh Ooh Ooh
# How did you heart ever get so cold
# How did someone ever get so close
# That you just don't know
# How it feels inside
# You're desensitized yeah
# I wanna believe that it's a phase you go through
# That only gets harder to tell
# And sometimes I think It's an easier thing to believe
# That there's somebody else
# (Chorus)
# Whatever they did
# Whatever they said
# You know it's much better just to run and forget
# Whatever it was
# Whoever's to blame
# You know you can let yourself be feeling again
# (Chorus) till end

# Je kdo doma so vrata ta
# na meji v tvoj svet
# Si sploh še živ, si že kdaj zavpil
# samo da slišal bi svoj lasten glas?
# Te je kaj strah, si še preplah,
# da vetru … bi nadel
# se zdiš mi znan ker te poznam
# saj vem kaj si vedno si želel.
# To je tvoj pravi obraz
# v prsih ti bije tvoj pravi jaz.
# Po licih polzijo ti solze miru
# saj zmeraj zapuščaš ta otok strahu.
# In padel boš, vstal kot mož
# na nebu priboril si svoj oblak.
# To je svet mask in bolečih prask
# mi zaupal je nekoč star siromak.
# Postal boš naš, če se predaš,
# v črno belem svetu siv junak.
# A vidim ti, da dobro veš,
# da modra ti najlepše pristoji.
# To je tvoj pravi obraz
# v prsih ti bije tvoj pravi jaz.
# Po licih polzijo ti solze miru
# saj zmeraj zapuščaš ta otok strahu.
# Ker to je tvoj pravi obraz
# v prsih ti bije tvoj pravi jaz.
# Po licih polzijo ti solze miru
# saj zmeraj zapuščaš ta otok strahu.
# Ker to je tvoj pravi obraz
# v prsih ti bije tvoj pravi jaz.
# Po licih polzijo ti solze miru
# saj zmeraj zapuščaš ta otok strahu.
# saj zmeraj zapuščaš ta otok strahu.

# I see the rising sun
# I feel the warming one
# We've come a circle
# To the way we once begun
# No one's really sure
# How to make it up
# Or give a name to the way
# We've been acting lately
# All around
# A man he buys a gun
# He is his father's son
# But one day he takes to gun
# And takes the lives of one and many
# Looking out one day
# A message comes to me
# I saw a woman tell the truth
# And end up behind bars
# I walked an empty street
# Proud to spill a tear
# Then came my shame
# My fear to blame
# The one and only
# See the rising sun
# Feel the warming one
# We've come a circle
# To the way we once begun
> Inxs
# Deep down in my heart
# There is a lot of words
# Tears fall down my face

# I wanna tell you
# Don't give it up
# I wanna tell you
# Don't give it up
# Hear the voices
# Wraps around you
# All the people
# Never doubt it
# Hear the voices
# Take a look at what's around you

# Nicky's in the corner
# With a black coat on
# Running from a bad home
# With some cat inside
# Now where did you find her
# Among the neon lights
# That haunt the streets outside
# She says
# Stay with me
# Beautiful girl
# Stay with me
# Beautiful girl
# Stay with me
# She wants to go home
# >From doorway to doorway
# Street corner to corner
# With the neon ghosts in the city

# She's so scared
# So very frightened
# Anything could happen
# Right here tonight

# Don't you wonder
# Is anyone that strong
# It takes me under

# I get so tired of watching friends go down
# The hungry tiger for all who never began
# Biting bullets
# Biting the clouds
# Biting bullets
# Biting the clouds
# I saw the show
# Shaking all the babies
# Should I believe the parade of clever lies
# Shadow of light in the shadow of death
# There is no difference to all who never began
# There was a time
# There was a way to live
# And it's no secret
# That it won't come back again
# I lose myself like anybody else
# But I'm not so strong to make it in the end
# I need some answers when the day comes crashing down
# 'Cause it's all over when there's no one to be found

# In the mist

# CHORUS
# I'm seeing my way
# For the first time in years
# When  the love around
# Begins to suffer
# And you can't find love
# In one
# In one another
# Push away those bitter tears

# And I thought I was doing no wrong
# And I thought I was doing no wrong
# In the hour of your needs
# Lips are trembling
# Cause you're gonna be free
# Realise what we're doing here
# The time is right to kill your fears
# Bitter tears taste so sweet
# CHORUS
# And I thought I was doing no wrong
# Push away those bitter tears
# Push away those bitter tears
# Push away those bitter tears
# Push away those bitter tears
# That's what they call doing no wrong

# Push away those bitter tears
# Push away those bitter tears

# Could be clear
# Black and white
# Make a decision
# Got a need inside and I don't know why
# It's a strong feeling that grows and grows
# One day my life is out the door
# Next day you show me what it's for
# One day I think I know myself
# Next day you leave me on the shelf
# New moment
# Goes like this
# Never forbidden
# There's nothing to stop
# The thief of time
# Stealing the hours that keep you away
# It rushes through my veins
# Straight to my head
# My mind is a planet
# For you to roam
# This is only just the start
# It's the beginning
# In this house I call home
# Living together
> Inxs
# It's no use pretending
# That I understand
# The hide and seek we play with facts
# It changes our demand
# Tilt my hat at the sun
# And the shadows they burn dark
# Light me and I'll burn for you
# And the love song never stops
# I like the look in your eyes
# When you talk that certain way
# I love the day in the life
# When you know that lover's way
# Minding my own business
# When you came along
# Temperature's been running hot
# The fever was so strong
# It's always an adventure
# The fantasies we make a fact
# You're the secret I desire
# I can't keep that to myself
# When we're not together
# It doesn't feel so bad
# We could be so far apart
# But our love's not sad
# It's no use pretending
# 'Cause I understand
# The hide and seek we play with facts
# It changes our demand

# In the dark of night

# What the fuck it's about
# All you lovers
# Take a look around
# Before they cut your roses down
# All they've got is bones and blood
# Don't they know that love is around
# Make your way through the pain
# You've got no one to blame
# Put a rope around
# Rush into the ground
# All in the name of love
# You meet the devil within

# Dancing on the jetty
# So our feet stay dry

# "My son ask for thyself another

# (King Philip of Macedonia - 339 B.C.)
# Near to the east
# In a part of ancient Greece
# In an ancient land called Macedonia
# Was born a son
# To Philip of Macedon
# The legend his name was Alexander
# At the age of nineteen
# He became the Macedon King
# And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
# By the Aegian Sea
# In 334 B.C.
# He utterly beat the armies of Persia
# [Chorus:]
# Alexander the Great
# His name struck fear into hearts of men
# Alexander the Great
# Became a legend 'mongst mortal men
# King Darius the third
# Defeated fled Persia
# The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
# Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well
# And he founded the city called Alexandria
# By the Tigris river
# He met King Darius again
# And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
# Entering Babylon
# And Susa, treasures he found
# Took Persepolis the capital of Persia
# [Chorus:]
# Alexander the Great
# His name struck fear into hearts of men
# Alexander the Great
# Became a God amongst mortal men
# A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
# And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
# And legend said that who untied the knot
# He would become the master of Asia
# Hellenism he spread far and wide
# The Macedonian learned mind
# Their culture was a western way of life
# He paved the way for Christianity
# Marching on, marching on
# The battle weary marching side by side
# Alexander's army line by line
# They wouldn't follow him to India
# Tired of the combat, pain and the glory
# Alexander the Great
# His name struck fear into hearts of men
# Alexander the Great

# Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
# Can you really tell me what life is?
# Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
# Could be swept away by fate's own hand
# We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
# We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
# When you think that we've used all our chances
# And the chance to make everything right
# Keep on making the same old mistakes
# Makes untipping the balance so easy
# When we're living our lives on the edge
# Say a prayer on the book of the dead
# We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
# We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
# And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life....

# Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
# About a thing that I saw
# One night wandering in the everglades
# I'd one drink but no more
# I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
# Gazing up at the stars
# Not aware of a presence so near to me
# Watching my every move
# Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
# As something rushed me from the trees
# Took me to an unholy place
# And that is where I fell from grace
# Then they summoned me over to join in with them
# To the dance of the dead
# Into the circle of fire I followed them
# Into the middle I was led
# As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
# But still I wanted to go
# And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
# As I walked onto the coals
# And I felt I was in a trance
# And my spirit was lifted from me
# And if only someone had the chance
# To witness what happened to me
# And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them
# All had death in their eyes
# Lifeless figures they were undead all of them
# They had ascended from hell
# As I danced with the dead
# My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
# Below my undead body
# Just danced the circle of dead
# Until the time came to reunite us both
# My spirit came back down to me
# I didn't know if I was alive or dead
# As the others all joined in with me
# By luck then a skirmish started
# And took the attention away from me
# When they took their gaze from me
# Was the moment that I fled
# I ran like hell faster than the wind
# But behind I did not glance
# One thing that I did not dare
# Was to look just straight ahead
# When you know that your time has come around
# You know you'll be prepared for it
# Say your last goodbyes to everyone
# Drink and say a prayer for it
# When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
# And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
# When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
# And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
# To this day I guess I'll never know
# Just why they let me go
# But I'll never go dancing no more

# Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive
# And some of us are here just so that we'll die
# How come the bullet hits the other guy
# Do we have to try and reason why
# [Chorus]
# Be it the Devil or be it him
# You can count on just one thing
# When the time is up you'll know
# Not just one power runs the show
# Are we the lucky ones saved for another day
# Or they the lucky ones who are taken away
# Is it a hand on your shoulder from the Lord above
# Or the Devil himself come to give you a shove.
# [Chorus]
# A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away
# A hurricane devastates the cities in its way
# The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind
# The worst is yet to come a hell to face mankind

# We live our lives in fever
# In choking sweat of fear
# In the heat of the night you can feel so much
# In the heat of the night I scream "Don't touch"
# [Chorus:]
# I remember a time when we used and abused
# And we fought all our battles in vain
# I remember a time we thought that passion was free
# In the heat of the night... bodies aflame
# We live in fever...
# I hear your secret heartbeat
# I can hear your silent cries
# The kids have lost their freedom
# And nobody cares till somebody famous dies...
# [Chorus:]
# Now we live, in a world of uncertainty
# Fear is the key - to what you want to be
# You don't get a say the majority gets it's way
# You're outnumbered by the bastards till the day you die...

# I am a man who walks alone
# And when I'm walking a dark road
# At night or strolling through the park
# When the light begins to change
# I sometimes feel a little strange
# A little anxious when it's dark
# Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
# I have constant fear that something's always near
# Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
# I have a phobia that someone's always there
# Have you run your fingers down the wall
# And have you felt your neck skin crawl
# When you're searching for the light?
# Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
# At the corner of the room
# You've sensed that something's watching you
# Have you ever been alone at night
# Thought you heard footsteps behind
# And turned around and no-one's there?
# And as you quicken up your pace
# You find it hard to look again
# Because you're sure there's someone there
# Watching horror films the night before
# Debating witches and folklore
# The unknown troubles on your mind
# Maybe your mind is playing tricks
# You sense, and suddenly eyes fix on dancing shadows from behind
# Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
# I have constant fear that something's always near
# Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
# I have a phobia that someone's always there

# Their actions beyond a reasoning
# Only god would know

# A lonely cry for help preaching out for help to anyone
# A silent prayer to god to help you on your way
# I've been depressed so long
# It's hard to remember when I was happy
# I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more
# But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way
# The hardest part is to get on with your life
# You're searching in the dark clutching at straws to find a way
# You take the tarot cards and throw them to the wind
# You ? question your beliefs your inner thoughts,
# Your whole existence
# And if there is a good then answer if you will
# And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place
# Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace
# If you could live your life again
# Would you change a thing or leave it all the same
# If you had the chance again
# Would you change the thing at all
# When you look back at your past
# Can you say that you are proud of what you've done
# Are there times when you believe
# That the right you thought was wrong
# All of my life I have believed
# Judgement of heaven is waiting for me
# All of my life now I have believed
# Judgement of heaven awaits for me...

# The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night.
# I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed,

# I can see what a life's meant to be,
# And you'll never know how I came to forsee, see, see.
# My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties,
# With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike.

# Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!

# The walls of gold entomb us,
# The swords of scorn divide,
# Take not thy thunder from us,

# No reason for a place like this,

# The Secret of the Hanged Man - the smile on his lips.
# The light of the Blind - you'll see,
# The venom that tears my spine,
# The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.
# She came to me with a serpent's kiss,
# As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips,
# Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,
# So we lay in a black embrace,
# And the Seed is sown in a holy place
# And I watched, and I waited for the Dawn.
# The light of the Blind - you'll see,
# The venom that tears my spine,
# The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.
# Blind all of us together,
# Ablaze with Hope and Free,
# No storm or heavy weather
# Will rock the boat you'll see.

# Hear the rime of the Ancient Mariner
# See his eye as he stops one of three
# Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
# Stay here and listen the nightmares
# of the Sea.
# And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
# Caught by his spell and
# the Mariner tells his tale.
# Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
# To a place where nobody's been
# Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
# Hailed in God's name,
# hoping good luck it brings.
# And the ship sails on, back to the North
# Through the fog and ice and
# the albatross follows on
# The mariner kills the bird of good omen
# His shipmates cry against what he's done
# But when the fog clears, they justify him
# And make themselves a part of the crime.
# Sailing on and on and North across the sea
# Sailing on and on and North 'til all is calm
# The albatross begins with its vengeance
# A terrible curse a thirst has begun
# His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner
# About his neck, the dead bird is hung.
# And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
# And the thirst goes on and on for them and me.
# "Day after day, day after day,
# we stuck nor breath nor motion
# As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
# Water, water everywhere and
# all the boards did shrink
# Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink."
# [SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE(1772-1834)]
# There, calls the Mariner,
# there comes a ship over the line
# But how can she sail with no wind
# in her sails and no tide.
# See...onward she comes
# Onward she nears, out of the sun
# See...she has no crew
# She has no life, wait but there's two.
# Death and she Life in Death.
# they throw their dice for the crew
# She wins the Mariner and he belong to her now.
# Then...crew one by one
# They drop down dead, two hundred men
# She...She Life in Death.
# She lets him live, her chosen one.
# [Narrative]
# "One after one by the star dogged moon,
# too quick for groan or sigh
# each turned his face with a ghastly pang,
# and cursed me with his eye
# four times fifty living men
# (and I heard nor sigh nor groan),
# with heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
# they dropped down one by one."
# [SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE (1772-1834)]
# The curse it lives on in their eyes
# The Mariner he wished he'd die
# Along with the sea creatures
# But they lived on, so did he.
# And by the light of the moon
# He prays for their beauty not doom
# With heart he blesses them
# God's creatures all of them too.
# Then the spell starts to break
# The albatross falls from his neck
# Sinks down like lead into the Sea
# Then down in falls comes the rain.
# Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
# See them stir and they start to rise
# Bodies lifted by good spirits
# None of them speak
# and they're lifeless in their eyes.
# And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
# Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.
# Now the curse is finally lifted
# And the Mariner sights his home
# Spirits go from the long dead bodies
# Form their light and
# the Mariner's left alone.
# And then a boat came sailing towards him
# It was a joy he could not believe
# The Pilot's boat, his son and the hermit.
# Penance of life will fall onto Him.
# And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
# And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins.
# The Mariner's bound to tell of his story
# To tell his tale wherever he goes
# To teach God's word by his own example
# That we must love all things that God made.
# And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
# And the tale goes on and on and on...and on

# Nightmares.....they won't leave me be.

# And I feel that I'm weaker every day
# Somehow I know I haven't long to go
# Joining them at the bottom of the pool.
# Now.....I feel they are so near
# I.....begin to see them clear
# Nightmares.....coming all the time
# Nightmares.....Will give me peace of mind.
# Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
# I must take you down there to look at them too
# Hand in hand then we'll jump right into the pool
# Can't you see not just me they want you too.
# Oh.....we'll drown together
# It.....will be forever.
# Nightmares.....forever calling me
# Nightmares.....Now we rest in peace.

# The only place where you can dream, living here is not what it seems.
# Ship of white light in the sky, nobody there to reason why.
# Here I am, I'm not really there, smiling faces ever so rare.
# A let's walk in deepest space, living here just isn't the place.
# Stalks of light come from the ground, when I cry there isn't a sound.
# All my feelings cannot be held, I'm happy in my new strange world.
# Shades of green grasses twine, girls drinking plasma wine.
# A look at love, a dream unfolds, living here, you'll never grow old.
# Don't you hear me call? Ooh

# Was many years ago that I left home and came this way
# I was a young man, full of hope and dreams
# But now it seems to me that all is lost and
# nothing gained
# Sometimes things ain't what they seem
# No brave new world, no brave new world
# No brave new world, no brave new world
# Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
# My spirit wanders endlessly
# Until the day will dawn and friends from home
# discover why
# Hear me calling, rescue me
# Set me free, set me free
# Lost in this place, and leave no trace
# [Chorus:]
# Stranger in a strange land
# Land of ice and snow
# Trapped inside this prison
# Lost and far from home
# One hundred years have gone and men again
# they came that way
# To find the answer to the mystery
# They found his body lying where it fell all that day
# Preserved in time for all to see
# No brave new world, no brave new world
# Lost in this place, and leave no trace
# What became of the man that started
# All are gone and their souls departed
# Left me here in this place
# So all alone

# That most of them
# Not coming back
# Sent off to war
# To play little games
# And on their return
# Can't name no names
# Some strange yellow gas
# Has played with their minds
# Has reddened their eyes
# Removed all the lies
# And strange as it sounds
# Death knows no bounds
# How many get well
# Only time will tell
# Only time will tell
# You lie in your death bed now
# But what did you bring to the table
# Brought us only holy sin
# Utter trust is a deadly thing
# To the prayer of holy peace
# We didn't know what was lying underneath
# So how could we be such fools
# And to think that we thought you knew the answer
# I can't begin to understand in all the lies
# But on your death bed I can see it in your eyes
# Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow
# It really makes sense I can see it clearly now
# Tangled up in a web of lies
# Could have been a way to prophesies
# Unaware of the consequence
# Not aware of the secrets that you kept
# Nothing that we could believe
# To reveal the facade of faceless men
# Not a thing that we could foresee
# Now a sign that would tell us the outcome
# You had us all strung out with promises of peace
# But all along your cover plan was to deceive
# Can it be put to rights now only time will tell
# Your prophecies will send us all to hell as well
# Left to all our golden sons
# All to pick up on the peace
# You could have given all of them
# A little chance...at least
# Take the world to a better place
# Given them all just a little hope
# Just think what a legacy
# You now...will leave
# We seem destined to live in fear
# And some that would say Armageddon is near
# But where there's a life while there's hope
# That man won't self destruct
# Why can't we treat our fellow men
# With more respect and a shake of their hands
# But anger and loathing is rife
# The death on all sides is becoming a way of life
# We live in an uncertain world
# Fear understanding and ignorance is leading to death
# Only the corpses are left
# For vultures that prey on their bones
# But some are just not wanting peace
# Their whole life is death and misery
# The only thing that they know
# Fight fire with fire life is cheap
# But if they do stop to think
# That man is teetering right on the brink
# But do you think that they care
# They benefit from death and pain and despair

# As if you're in a dream
# Not getting anywhere
# It seems so futile

# Run on and on
# Run on and on
# The loneliness of the long distance runner
# I've got to keep running the course
# I've got to keep running and win at
# All costs
# I've got to keep going be strong
# Must be so determined and push myself on
# Run over stiles across fields
# Turn to look at who's on your heels
# Way ahead of the field
# The line is getting nearer but do
# You want the glory that goes
# You reach the final stretch
# Ideals are just a trace
# You feel like throwing the race
# It's all so futile

# In the gloom the gathering storm abates
# In the ships gimlet eyes await
# The call to arms to hammer at the gates
# To blow them wide throw evil to its fate
# All summers long the drills to build the machine
# To turn man from flesh and blood to steel
# From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach
# From summer sends to Armageddon's reach
# Overlord your master not your god
# The enemy coast dawning grey with scud
# These wretched souls puking shaking fear
# To take a bullet for those who send them here
# The world's all right the cliffs erupt in flame
# No escape remorseless shrapnel rains
# Drowning men no chance for a warrior's fate
# A choking death enter hell's gates
# Sliding we go only fear on our side
# To the edge of the wire
# And we rush with the tide
# Oh the water is red
# With the blood of the dead
# But I'm still alive pray to God I survive
# How long on this longest day
# 'Till we finally make it through
# How long on this longest day
# 'Till we finally make it through
# The rising dead faces bloated torn
# They are relieved the living wait their turn
# Your number's up the bullet's got your name
# You still go on to hell and back again
# Valhalla waits Valkyries rise and fall
# The warrior tombs lie open for us all
# A ghostly hand reaches through the wall
# Blood and sand we will prevail
# Sliding we go only fear on our side
# To the edge of the wire

# They make their way but maybe too late
# They've got to try to save the day.
# The panicking cries the roaring of guns
# are echoing all around the valley.
# The mission complete they make to escape
# away from the Eagles Nest.
# They dared to go where no one would try
# they chose to fly where eagles dare.

# I get in from work at 2 a.m.
# And sit down with a beer
# Turn on late night TV
# And then wonder why I'm here
# It's meaningless and trivial
# And it washes over me
# And once again I wonder
# Is this all there is for me
# Here I am again
# Look at me again
# Here I am again
# On my own
# Trying hard to see
# What there is for me
# Here I am again
# On my own
# Life seens so pathetic
# I wish I could leave it all behind
# This canvas chair, this bed
# These walls that fall in on my mind
# Hold on for something better
# That just drags you through the dirt
# Do you just let go or carry on
# And try to take the hurt
# Here I am again
# Look at me again
# Here I am again
# On my own
# Trying hard to see
# What there is for me
# Here I am again
# On my own

# I'm gonna organize some changes in my life
# I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past
# I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road
# I'm feeling ready to just open up and go
# And I just feel I can be anything
# That all I might ever wish to be
# And fantasize just what I want to be
# Make my wildest dreams come true
# I'm on my way
# Out on my own again
# I'm on my way
# Out on the road again
# When I remember back to how that things just used to be
# And I was stuck inside a shroud of misery
# I felt I'd disappeared so deep inside myself
# I couldn't find a way to break away my hell
# When I'm feeling down and low
# I vow I'll never be the same again
# I just remember what I am
# And visualize just what I'm gonna be
# I'm on my way
# Out on my own again
# I'm on my way
# Out on the road again
# I'm on my way
# Out on my own again
# I'm on my way

# We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
# No matter how much you hate it, its evident and its blatant
# We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
# No matter if you don't like it, there ain't no way you can fight it
# [Verse 1]
# There ain't no way that you know what you gon' be doing day to day
# You might get laid with strays, from some beef that was down the way
# And you had nothing to do with it, and now you leaking fluids kid
# Your arm blown out the socket, doctor telling you you losing it
# Confusing it with movies, they still refuse to believe it
# Till the truck jackknifes in front of you while you speeding and you can't weave it
# Now you out of luck and out of choices, only seconds left
# You gasp, but everything happens too fast to catch a second breath
# Or a mother's life ambition, for her son to go to college
# Shattered by a nameless bullet in a act of random violence
# Perpetrated by his childhood friend he used to go outside with
# Now he lay silent with a hole in his chest, and open eyelids
# A blowout on a highway can probably make you late
# But a blowout on a icy bridge can have you and your kids in the lake
# And your family at your wake, praying over your casket
# His son didnt make that trip, so I guess hes a lucky bastard

# Just as sure as the seasons change, everything happens for a reason
# We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
# Any second your life could change, if its sunny you might get rain
# [Verse 2]
# There ain't no way around the fact, whether you white or brown or black
# That any moment, any second, any day could be your last
# I knew this cat thats very talented in basketball, in fact
# He could have went to any college in the nation on his stats
# Who would have known that after practice, in the gym next to the track
# That he would suddenly collapse and perish from a heart attack
# Or a healthy child that was born through the pain of maternal labor
# To pass away in his sleep in his bed, three days later
# And there ain't no explanation, even after investigation
# God I guess wanted to keep him away from Satan's temptations
# So he called him back, whats wrong with that? We won't see him tomorrow
# Though we know hes in a better place we still live with the sorrow
# People ask me how I'm feeling, what I'm doing, I'm chillin'
# But before I say what I'ma do I tell em, "God willin'"
# Cause I never know whats gonna happen, one day you're here
# And the next day you're gone, and the cycle just keeps moving along
# We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
# No matter how much you hate it, its evident and its blatant

# Got off the bus with smiling faces, cause school was really live today
# And now I'm trying to change my clothes so I can go outside and play
# I went inside, my mom is heated, cause when she's mad, she don't smirk
# I told a joke, she asked me if I brought home any homework
# I said "Naw, its Friday, and after school its my day
# And I want to go outside and spend the rest of it my way"
# She said, not before you take out the trash and sweep the floor
# I thought that wasn't fair cause that's one of my sister's chores
# I'm sorta heated, cause I'm trying to get with my mans
# Everything was set, my mom was the only wrench in my plans
# We was going to the river today, steal boats and ride em
# I jumped on my bike as quick as I can, to try to find em
# I'm all pissed off at my moms, its about 5:21
# By the time I make it down there I'm gonna miss all the fun
# When I finally got there, its like 6 and a quarter
# Shocked, as I watched the cops drag my friends' bodies out of the water
# We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers

# I'm American Pie, get a slice
# I'm what you call ice
# I'm rested in my showcase for a real good price
# About as much as a car, but not too much for a star
# Some cat paid cash on me so we could look flashy at the bar
# I draw too much attention, really, but this clown is really silly
# He's like "I'm just a flosser babay" so come and get me
# Chickens crowd around just to see
# "I like your chain, can I chill with you in VIP?" ...stupid!
# He got drunk, he got high
# He got crunk with the guys
# But if he woulda realized, he woulda watched for the hungry eyes
# Now I, feel like someone's watching meee
# And if I didnt know better, I'd think that they were plottin' (yo, stick this nig')
# I'm hangin' from this cat's neck, making eye contact
# With thugs that need 2 ID's to cash checks
# Suddenly I see them whispering like they was in the huddle
# While this fella's cuddled up with a chick, poppin' some bubbles
# And its double trouble, cause he really don't care
# And the worst thing you could be right now is unaware
# I hang helplessly, waiting for the deal to go down
# Thinking, "Damn, how did I ever get mixed up with this clown?", because I'm
# [Chorus 2x]
# Ice, people spend they whole lives trying to chase me
# Ice, people spend a good price just to replace me
# Ice, I could get you play from the illest dimes, cause I'm
# Ice, I could get you slain in the illest crimes
# [Verse 2]
# I'm on the dance floor swinging
# With my brother, hes sitting on his hands all blingin', we mixing it up
# Plus, he got Cris' in his cup, and its spilling on the floor
# Grindin' on a shorty, plotting on her, looking to score
# Cause hes a playa, and his neck is frosty like the Himalayas
# Chickens like that, he spilled a drink on me, "I'll be right back"
# He went into the bathroom to wipe me off
# When two cats came in behind him and went right to the stalls
# They nodded like they was saying "What up" but no words were spoken
# They had they back to us, we couldn't see what they was holding
# My owner was too drunk to even see what was happening
# He turned around to leave, one cat gave him some dap and said
# "Yo, your chain is hot, son, but I'm too broke to cock one
# So gimme yours unless you really wanna catch a hot one"
# I felt helpless, this cat was about to die because of me
# That's when I felt his hand grab me, my owner yelled and
# That nigga pulled out a weapon from his pelvis
# And shot him one time, the bullet came out his spine
# Over the music you could hear the shot *gunshot*, everybody started running
# My owner, his body dropped next to the sink
# The two thugs ran, because this wasn't part of the plan
# He put me in his pocket, put his pistol back in his pants
# And jumped in the whip, and where we went? No one knows
# But he took away someone's soul, left his body dead cold, you know?
# [Chorus 2x]
# car starting, music playing in background*
# Word..
# Is that how it is out here now?
# Niggaz trying to die for they chain now?
# You stupid fucking..
# (I think you killed him!)
# So what?
# I'm hungry out here man, I gotta eat
# Ain't got time for all these clown niggaz thinking they sweet out here and shit
# Guess we home free on this one though huh?

# I'm dropping it from Jersey to the Dirty Dirty, yeah you heard me
# Half these rappers suck like Kirby, do I think I'm hot? Certainly
# Hurtin' me, well that's impossible, illogical
# I'm virtually unstoppable
# To try me is to end up in a hospital
# I gotta go the distance, see this day down to the finish

# To the southside yeah! (What!) It's on up in here! (What!)

# Roxette -
# Lay a whisper on my pillow
# Leave the winter on the ground
# I wake up lonely
# A stare of silence
# In the bedroom and all around
# Touch me now
# I close my eyes
# And dream away
# It musta been love
# But it's over now
# It musta been good
# But I lost it somehow
# It musta been love
# But it's over now
# From the moment we touched
# 'Til the time had run out
# Make believin' we're together
# That I'm sheltered by your heart
# But in and outside
# I turn to water
# Like a teardrop in your arm
# And it's a hard winters day
# I dream away

# Januar siv, obzorje je skril,
# predmestni sneg, pobelil je breg.
# Svinec z neba je legel na tla,
# na naju dva je padla tema.
# Pobegniva v najlepši letni čas.
# Sonce v oči, nasmeh na obraz ti želi.
# Ref.: Imel sem rad vso pomlad,
# zelene livade s teboj,
# Najlepše so, ko cveto,
# zelene livade s teboj.
# Minil je maj, kje so zdaj,
# zelene livade s teboj?
# Žive naprej, v pesmi tej,
# zelene livade s teboj.
# Padlo drevo, več raslo ne bo.
# Pozabil bi, srce ne pusti.
# V sanjah živim, zgubljen hrepenim,
# Kot ptič ujet, klilčem te spet:

# Sonce v oči, nasmeh na obraz ti želi.

# "-Gotovo ga prodal slabo je..", dejali so

# Tam je srečal človeka, ki mu je razložil.
# Razložil njegovo dušo je.
# Razložil jo je, zložiti pa je znal ni več!
# Popotnik je plačal kar je terjal in odšel naprej.
# Spravil dušo v kovček je in odšel naprej.
# Popotnik je plačal kar je terjal in odšel naprej.
# Šel od psihiatra je, do psihiatra in vsi so bili kot otroci.
# Jemljejo drug drugemu igračo iz rok!
# Znova zložili bi jo radi, a zastonj!
# Jemljejo drug drugemu igračo iz rok,
# so razložili jo.
# So razložili jo kot je prav, čeprav jo zložijo narobe.
# Nazadnje je utrujen od vsega pozabil kovček v čakalnici,
# imel je težave z njim v uradu za najdene predmete.
# Ni znal povedati kakšna njegova duša je bila,
