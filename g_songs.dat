# I'm forever blowing bubbles,
# Pretty bubbles in the air,
# They fly so high, nearly reach the sky,
# Then like my dreams they fade and die.
# Fortune's always hiding,
# I've looked everywhere,
# I'm forever blowing bubbles,
# Pretty bubbles in the air.
# I'm dreaming dreams, I'm scheming schemes,
# I'm building castles high.
# They're born anew, their days are few,
# Just like a sweet butterfly.
# And as the daylight is dawning,
# They come again in the morning!
# I'm forever blowing bubbles,
# Pretty bubbles in the air,
# They fly so high, nearly reach the sky,
# Then like my dreams they fade and die.
# Fortune's always hiding,
# I've looked everywhere,
# I'm forever blowing bubbles,
# Pretty bubbles in the air.
# When shadows creep, when I'm asleep,
# To lands of hope I stray!
# Then at daybreak, when I awake,
# My bluebird flutters away.
# Happiness, you seem so near me,
# Happiness, come forth and cheer me!
# I'm forever blowing bubbles,
# Pretty bubbles in the air,
# They fly so high, nearly reach the sky,
# Then like my dreams they fade and die.
# Fortune's always hiding,
# I've looked everywhere,
# I'm forever blowing bubbles,
# Pretty bubbles in the air.

# Baby you got, you got, you got, you got what I want
# Baby you got, you got, you got, you got what I need
# Now shake that thang
# Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it up
# Girl shake that thang
# Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it up
# [Chorus - 50 Cent]
# Baby you got
# Hips that hypnotize
# When you walk I can't help but watch you shake
# I love the way you shake (Baby you got)
# Hips that make a nigga fantasize
# I could spend a day lost in your eyes (Baby you got)
# Some kind of control on me
# Feels like you got a hold on me (Baby you got)
# My imagination running wild
# Infatuated with your physical, damn, I like your style
# [Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
# It's something about your style, it's something about your smile
# It's something about you making me want you right now
# If you don't like me, then don't listen to me
# Lord knows I spit that G that have you coming out your clothes
# I'm a professional when I become sexual
# You need a chaperone to bring your girlfriend next to you
# Don't it sound like phone sex, kinky, when I talk switch the slang
# Partner, tell that nigga from New York, shorty
# Come ride on my roller coaster
# Porn star stamina, I try not to damage ya
# Unlimited tongue action 'til you're climaxin'
# Foreplay, you can have it your way
# I follow directions, whoa, your jiggling baby
# Back shots have your whole back wiggling crazy
# After sipping on Nightrain, that potent pipe game
# I have you saying "slow down baby"
# [Verse 2 - Young Buck]
# Baby it's hard to look and don't touch
# Girl the way you strut and dressed in your Von Dutch
# I don't know if it's your lips or your hips that got me
# Or the way that ass bounce when you move your body
# I'm parked outside in the blue Denali
# There's room for two, just me and you, if you 'bout it
# Ice from Tiffany & Co., Norma Kamali footwear
# I spend g's, I'm a G, that's a good look girl
# You need a thug that can handle that
# One dose'll make you go and put my name on your back
# Whenever you pass through, whatever they ask you
# Just tell em you my boo, and show em your tattoo, ooohh
# Don't hurt nobody baby
# When you drop to the ground and drive me crazy
# I done been around the world, and I finally found ya
# Now back that ass up and let me get behind ya (ahhh!)
# [Verse 3 - Lloyd Banks]
# Baby you've got a hell of a first impression
# Making me wanna ask you a personal question
# Like "Are you flexible?" and "How do you like it?"
# Give me a little input, I'm not a psychic
# Cuz you can exit as soon as you get the ok
# You got a body like Nicole Ray, hey
# I need a drink, I'll be right back
# But before I go, do that little dance, yeah, just like that
# It's late, I have to score, "This blue drink tastes good, don't it?"
# "Sure it does, now have some more"
# I'm deep, but she got her ladies wit her
# So bring em, I'll call ya a babysitter
# So we can hit the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
# I'm contemplatin' how my time's spent
# Cuz I'm bent, and I'm as hard as a brick, love
# You move like you work in a strip club

# Niggas done heard about my click how we stay wit the toastas
# Blood in, blood out, la kostra nostra
# You don't wanna bang wit the best
# I'll have Doc removin fragments from your chest
# They say God's a forgivin' man, I hope he forgive
# Thirty shells I let off don't curse my kid
# They say Fifty done blew up, Fifty you changed
# Nigga you stunt, I pull out
# And you see I'm that same nigga that when he start to roar
# I think he's flyin
# Eight outta eight on movin targets
# You run? You still dyin
# Check my resume, I am oh so loco
# Mama ain't raise no chump, I don't talk no pocco
# [Chorus - 50 Cent/Lloyd Banks]
# Sticks and stones may break bones and the shells may hurt me
# But I take it like a man, you beg for mercy
# Keep your eyes wide open, nigga's lookin for it too
# Shit is real 'round here, you surrounded by crooks
# Sticks and stones may break bones and the shells may hurt me

# There once was some niggas that tried to murda me
# I hit em up, put em in plastic surgery
# This 4-5 has made a lot of guys apologize
# The truth come out, 'stead of hearin' a lot of lies
# Some niggas catch a case and then claim they hard
# A couple chest wounds will make a nigga change his heart
# I just play my part, and while you shootin up cars
# I'm smokin' niggas like a Cuban cigar
# Let's get it poppin'

# I'm tired of you niggas with your maybe beef
# We gonna be here forever, you're temporary like baby teeth
# I'm in and out the night clubs, A-D-D
# Dark blue Benz, navy seats, eighty sneaks
# These niggas tellin' out the blue
# So you hang em off the bridge
# At least they'll have to helicopter you
# The Jimmy lived in the bags, the Bell or Hop will do
# I rap for the neighborhood niggas that failed in high school
# You can tell I came a long way in my sense, home grown
# That's why them little niggas in the projects love me
# You provide the beat downs for free, I paid my dues
# I don't even freestyle for free
# I gave em a break, flew over seas
# But it's kinda hard to get homie-sick when there's blue in the trees
# Sit back and try to play your role wit the copies
# I put more staples in yo ass than a telephone pole, Yea

# I, know, you, know

# I put that snub nose to ya and bust nigga
# If, you don't know, who I be
# You betta ask somebooooody about me
# And they'll tell ya I'm a soldier boy
# And I done told ya, over and over boy

# I come from a big city, the streets corrupt
# Now I'm rollin with snub-noses to heat you up
# Out here niggaz'll do anything to reach a buck
# Cause when you broke you can't afford to fuck ya sneakers up
# I take my time, keep my mind on my bank funds
# Learn how to seperate the real from the fake ones
# And on my heater nina rep what could I carry on
# My nigga just lost his momma, and his daddy gone
# From now on I can provide cause my paper's straight
# Family losin his legs, but I can take the weight
# Some niggaz hate but I'll be damned if they hold me down
# Front niggaz didn't know me then, bet they know me now
# Blunt and a smile, eventually it'll be a frown
# Cause every time I turn around a nigga locked down
# While I'm in the world, tryin to bring my loot through
# Hopin one day we can kick it like we used to, my nigga
# [Verse Two: Young Buck]
# Uhh, they never seen 26's on a Hummer
# My goal is to try to fuck Trina by the summer
# Some niggaz hate me, but they only made me
# Go and put mo' ice in my mouth than Baby (bling bling!)
# G-Unit and Shady, them dudes is crazy
# Next time, we only usin Dr. Dre's beats
# Fuck you, pay me, take your magazine flicks
# This ain't no Nelly hurr, take a good look at this
# Got the wrists of a chemist and the heart of a hustler
# Plus I probably done robbed mo' artists than Russell
# Always in trouble, you can blame my mother
# Gave birth to a gorilla and raised him in the jungle
# I ain't crawled, I stumbled across the Mexican with birds
# Papi had coke and new plates and pounds of herb

# People act like they don't know who did it, but they notice me
# Every day's a death threat, but I ain't dead yet
# So I go put a hole in a nigga from the next set
# Don't know where I slept at, just know where my tec at
# It's the first of the month, my bitch ain't got her check yet
# Juvie left me in California, I don't respect that
# I love him too much to beef, so I'ma accept that
# But I'ma just step back, and focus on Buck
# Tired of ridin in yours, I'm bout to buy my own truck
# Got to try my own luck, "Get Rich or Die Tryin'"

# You don't know what I been through to get what I done got

# I murder you all-talk like a clip without a glock
# When you holla G-Unit on some other shit
# You need to do the research, and see who you fuckin wit
# I smoke all your weed up, go run up your Beeza
# Your baby momma want me, I don't want that skeeza
# She's scratched my Beema, but I ain't seen-her
# When I catch the bitch, I'ma gangsta lean-her - WHOA
# We be playin in them videos, with them pretty hoes
# Cash bucks and the key bitches and New York City hoes
# They learned it from Lil' Kim to let they titties show
# I'm the King of the South, this is how it really goes
# Lord knows, I keep all my jewels froze
# As long as the check come, then FUCK the award shows
# You know me nigga
# [Verse Three: Young Buck]
# Half of these kids never read the Bibles
# But they can tell you how to kill a man better than I do
# The reason they fucked up, they all been lied to
# I know what it feels like when a nigga misguide you
# My momma stay in the projects and I been havin money
# I went bought her a house, but she told me she ain't want it
# (What?) Right then I understood that the hood's in my blood
# So I hollered CASH REAL, lettin 'em know where I'm from
# Niggaz know I got a gun when I come to the club
# And if it go down, you better tell your people to duck
# Why should I slow down, I just got started targettin artists
# Wait 'til the bullets start hoppin out the cartridge
# I come to get it poppin, pray to God the news watchin
# So when they see 'em snitch niggaz'll know who got 'em
# We came from the bottom to the top, from hoopties to a drop
# And kill or be killed is the attitude I got nigga

# Show me where they at
# I'll stop 'em from talking like that
# [50 Cent]
# I'm the talk to hit every barbershop and beauty salon
# Cause these other niggas that rap ain't on the sh** that I'm on
# Cause 50 this, 50 that, 50 stay with a gat
# Thirty-two shots in the clip, hollow tips in the Mack
# But when I come through, shh... the talking stop
# My money long now, I can make the Pope get shot
# Now, we can blow an hour talking bout the stones I rock
# All the hoes I got, cause he stunts in the drop
# Now, naw, you love the kids, 50 on that killa sh**
# That been mobbed the bad man, bi***y as guerilla sh**
# I'm marking my music like diesel on the block
# So if you with me you gon' eat and you gon' starve if you not
# Weed smokers love me like they love Buddha
# I'll send your kids through the shooter, Crip niggas love me like they love Hoova
# They tell me see careful good, cause niggas wanna see like you
# They ain't used to a G like you, BLAM!
# [Young Buck]
# You think you a killer but we gon just pay 'em a visit
# Put the potato in the barrel so nobody hear it
# I keep a holster on my shoulder like I'm John Wayne
# Shooting these niggas lights out like Lebron James
# Holla my name, gimme a reason to see you bleeding
# After you feel these hollow tips, nigga, then we eating
# Full of anger until there's no more bullets in the chamber
# Ain't nothing like when you get popped and don't know who to blame-a
# Nigga told me, 'Do your dirt all by your lonely'
# So I go hit them niggas 'fore 50 couldn't even hold me
# I'm waiting, anticipating to put a nigga under
# Smoking like we some Jamaicans f***ing with this ganja
# Ride with no hesitation, retaliation is a must
# Bad as I want to, some sh** I just don't discuss
# So point him out and watch how I knock him off
# Everywhere you bi***es go, I got a nigga watching ya'll, motherf***ers!
# [Lloyd Banks]
# Come on, nigga, I ain't here to make no friends, just cut the checks
# I got a long pump that'll put your stupid ass up the steps
# Begging niggas don't understand though
# Probably cause my hand glow when I'm anticipating the lambo
# Lean out my bucket for niggas thinking they Rambo
# You get one warning so I suggest you let your man know
# These rap niggas portray to be tough, nobody acting soft
# 'Til they laid out in the hospital, eating applesauce
# Usually for yapping off and turn apologetic
# Waving a white flag, the danger they might have
# My niggas buying so much ammo
# If you reach in the couch for loose change, you'll probably feel on the handle
# Holding sixteens to get your bandages and broke bones
# So I suggest you get alarm systems in both homes
# There's only one team on top, we number one with a glock
# f*** around and get your dumb ass SHOT!

# My hand bling full of platinum the shine is chrome
# He even got closet space inside of my home
# He ain't never been broke he glitchless

# We been in a box but we both still spittin'
# And when there was beef you even played your position
# Got under the seat until we spotted our victim
# At first they wouldn't listen to they heard you go off
# Remember it was broad daylight in the middle of New York
# And little did they know we was ready for war
# Bet that nigga wished he'd never stick his head out the door
# See whenever you come out something happen on the block
# You the reason that nigga done stop rappin' like Pac
# People see you ain't run and you even say shit

# Wooo! I wanna be the reason you smile
# I wanna be the reason you smi-ile
# I wanna be the reason you smile
# After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes
# [Verse One: Lloyd Banks]
# I'm gettin the feelin you wanna take revenge
# From the conversations we have and the way it ends
# You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
# That's why it's just me and my Mercedes Benz
# It all depends, maybe if we make amends
# We can start from scratch
# Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact
# We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact
# So everytime we seperate, somebody's marchin back
# You're amazing in the sack
# Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're black
# God Bless whoever gave you alla that
# If you seen her from the back
# You'd understand why dis feel like that
# And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows
# Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
# And I ain't gotta say nothin, she just knows
# By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes
# Up and down
# [Chorus: Lloyd Banks + (50 Cent)]
# Whenever I'm not around, and you feelin down
# Let the thought of me be (I be the reason you smile)
# I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown
# I wanna bring you joy and be (I be the reason you smile)
# Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down
# I provide by any means to be (I be the reason you smile)
# We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while
# I'm just happy I'm around to be (I be the reason you smile)
# [Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
# The main reason I been lookin at you pitiful
# What about the half of this shit I done did to you
# Violated and tip toed into a crib or two
# I've come clean to be a bigger individual
# Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you
# Kinda makes me feel lucky, cause I see niggaz
# when you tease 'em with your physical
# She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left
# Wild drama, section 8 princess
# My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed
# Cause it's hard to communicate
# Cause she don't speak-a no english
# I been around the world from state to state
# But now I'm back bustin in your bathroom
# Got you laughin in your shower cap, let's get it on
# Cause I'm leavin in a hour, fly-through, don't matter she's mad
# Even when I holla back
# All I really need your attention for a while
# And, I bet you I can make you smile
# [Chorus - 2X]

# The only thing changed is the numbers on the range
# I bought me an old school and blew out the brains
# The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain
# My sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing
# And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game
# Come on now, we all know gold is getting old
# The ice in my teeth keep the crystal cold
# G-Unit homie, actin' like yall don't know

# Im lovin' how you look in my eyes
# Swingin' them hips when you pass
# I'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby
# Jump on this Harley
# Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley
# Sip some Bacardi
# Then go pull up at the afterparty
# I think we make a perfect couple
# But you think I'm trouble
# Maybe thats the reason you gave me the wrong number
# She got me feeling like "maybe she the wrong woman"
# Think im'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'
# Your toes painted half fixed all the time
# And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
# If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
# I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do
# Making decisions shorty good things don't last long
# Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
# Before I head home
# Im'a stop at your house and blow the horn
# If you come outside you know it's on
# [Lloyd Banks]
# Bitches be frustrated with the baller
# Wonder why I don't call her
# Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her
# It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her
# In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
# She loves it when I'm in town
# Hate it when I'm not around
# I get her and wear down
# Next door neighboors hear the sound
# Pictures hittin' the ground
# Just enough to hold us down
# I'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round
# Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
# I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady
# I admit I fell in love with a frame
# And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name
# Her panties wet over fame
# Fall in love with my chain
# I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain
# Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
# I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.

# How could I know when I first met you
# I was falling in love, never wanting to
# Cause out of the blue you went my way
# So lost for words, don’t know what to say
# It’s a craving
# Feels like in misbehaving
# Feels like I’m going crazy
# Only you can save me
# I’m falling but I can’t stop- can’t stop
# A little bit of you is never enough
# Feels like I’m falling-falling
# Feels like a new day’s dawning
# Try as I might I just can’t hide
# When you came you unlocked all I had inside
# Like a piece of puzzle that slots in fine
# You came in my life and you made it right
# Just a feeling –feeling
# It’s not just my heart you’re stealing
# You know all there is to know
# Cause you’ve seen inside my soul
# I’m falling but I can’t stop- can’t stop
# A little bit of you is never enough
# Feels like I’m falling-falling
# Feels like a new day’s dawning
# You’re on my mind all the time, morning, noon and night
# Without you, without love
# I just can’t survive no
# It’s a craving
# Feels like in misbehaving
# Feels like I’m going crazy
# Only you can save me
# I’m falling but I can’t stop- can’t stop
# A little bit of you is never enough
# Feels like I’m falling-falling
# Feels like a new day’s dawning

# You tried your best to show me
# That you really cared
# said if there were days I was lonely
# Just call you - you?d be there
# You tried your best convinced me
# That you understand
# And if I need someone to hold on to
# You wanted to be the man
# Then I knew it was true
# All the feelings that I had inside for you
# I could not deny
# Though many times I tried
# Give me a little more time
# I need to make up my mind
# Cos you know I?m in two minds
# I wanna be more than your friend
# Ooh I just can?t pretend any longer
# Feelings getting stronger
# Give me a little more time....
# You?ve been there when I?ve needed
# You?ve never let me down
# I just don?t know how I?d cope
# Without you being around
# Feelings have grown between us
# Though friends we have been
# Don?t you think it complicates things
# Or is it just me
# Then I knew it was true
# All the feelings that you had
# I shared them too
# I could not deny

# Knew the signs
# Wasn't right
# I was stupid for a while
# Swept away by you
# And now I feel like a fool
# So confused,
# My heart's bruised
# Was I ever loved by you?
# Out of reach, so far
# I never had your heart
# Out of reach,
# Couldn't see
# We were never
# Meant to be
# Catch myself
# From despair
# I could drown
# If I stay here
# Keeping busy everyday
# I know I will be OK
# But I was
# So confused,
# My heart's bruised
# Was I ever loved by you?
# Out of reach, so far
# I never had your heart
# Out of reach,
# Couldn't see
# We were never
# Meant to be
# So much hurt,
# So much pain
# Takes a while
# To regain
# What is lost inside
# And I hope that in time,
# You'll be out of my mind

> Gabrielle
# From the moment that we met
# I knew that we would connect
# Your eyes had told me that somehow
# We shared a history
# Feeling fearless I took a chance
# Couldn’t let the moment pass
# I felt that fate had played a hand
# And brought you here to me
# But happiness can be short-lived
# And pain can bring you to your knees
# Chorus:
# Don’t think, that I’ll get over you
# Don’t know, if I can make it through
# My darkest days without you in my life and i
# Don’t think, that I can face the pain
# I’ll never see your face again
# I close my eyes and wonder when
# Will it ever end
# Get as close as we could be
# Felt that you could see through me
# You read my mind you knew my life
# Became a part of me
# Took for granted precious time
# Thought we had it on our side
# By some cruel twist of fate
# I had to watch you fade away
# (Chorus)
> Gabrielle
# I know that it’s over
# But I can’t believe we’re through
# They said that time’s a healer
# And I’m better without you
# It’s gonna take time I know
# But I’ll get over you
# Chorus:
# Look at my life
# Look at my heart
# I have seen them fall apart
# Now I’m ready to rise again
# Look at my hopes
# Look at my dreams
# I’m building bridges from these scenes
# Now I’m ready to rise again
# Caught up in my thinking, yeah
# Like a prisoner in my mind
# You pose so many questions
# But the truth was hard to find
# I better think twice I know
# That I’ll get over you
# (Chorus)
# Much time has passed between us
# Do you still think of me at all?
# My world of broken promises
# Now you won’t catch me when I fall

# Here I am, waiting for a sign, I never seem to know

# Though we're not the perfect match
# I just can't explain
# Should I stay
# Should I go
# Could I ever really stand to let you go

# That maybe I'm getting in your way
# I feel your warmth, got me wanting more, you've left the door half open

# It's like a trick that can change your life

# Sing a song

# And your troubles turn into a smile
# There is no need of living this way

# Happiness is something you can get easily
# Things are the way you just want them to be
# Estar al sol es vida, tu corazòn lo mira
# Tu corazòn lo quiere, mi cuerpo se calienta

# I know that my fear will be gone

# Come, come, stay with me

# V svojo oazo na divjo ekstazo
# A kaj ko sanjam le
# Zna hipnotizirati vse toeke pravilno masirati
# Rojena je zame kraljica omame
# Za vedno sanjal bi
# Ah uh ah

# Vsi hormoni podivjajo do najvi?je eta?e
# Na njeno gladko ko?o se prilepim kot klop
# Namesti se v sedlo me po?ene v galop

# Let me do my thing

# V njeni dru?bi bo vedno vroea atmosfera
# Ker umazana je kot Cristina Aguilera
# Rada menja vloge spreminja ambient
# Kadar ona je zdravnica sem jaz pacient
# Veasih pride v savno veasih v jacuzzi
# Izziva v roza prozorni bluzi

# Eutili v sili nismo gravitacije
# Krmilo ostalo je brez navigacije
# Zlobni pirati so vzeli nam ?e vesla
# Je barko voda v neznano nesla
# Usli?al bog na?o je molitev
# Poslal nam sonce kot odre?itev
# Preplezali smo zla zidove...

$ Somewhere Out In Space
# [ Music: hansen, Zimmermann, Schlachter / Lyrics: Hansen ]
# [ Melo: Kai ]
# I have come from so far away
# From the sunlight of my home
# And I have seen it's the only way
# Now my sun is dead and gone
# I raise my head in silent anger
# Seems there is no place for me
# The only way out is to go
# Where no one's gone before
# Fly - Beyond the gates of space and time
# Another universe is mine
# And I can't wait untill tomorrow
# Ride - There's a call from deep within
# I know I won't return again
# 'Cause I will dive into the black hole
# Don't wait for me, 'cause I won't come back
# Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
# Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
# Oh, oh, oh ...
# Thunder and lightning and fire
# Are guiding the trip of my life
# Insatiable burning desire
# As into the unknown I dive
# I raise my head in silent anger
# Seems there is no place for me
# The only way out is to go
# Where no one's gone before
# Fly - Beyond the gates of space and time
# Another universe is mine
# Ind I can't wait until tomorrow
# Ride - There is a call from deep within
# I know I won't return again
# 'Cause I will dive into the black hole
# Don't wait for me, 'cause I won't come back
# Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
# Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
# Oh, oh, oh, don't wait
# There was a trigger, for my decision
# It's right behind my eyes
# Into the darkness of my vision
# I let my spirit rise
# I wanna see the black hole, into the dark
# I wanna dive into the black hole, down into the dark
# Into the black hole, into the dark
# Into the spiral, into the dark, the dark, the dark
# [ Solo: Kai / Harmony: Henjo / Melo: Kai ]
# If there's a possible chance for something that can be
# Called future behind the spiral
# The only way to find out, is to leave the final frontier
# To eternity and fly
# I will fly - Beyond the gates of space and time
# I leave the universe behind
# And I can't wait untill tomorrow
# Fly - Beyond the gates of space and time
# I know the universe is mine
# 'Cause I will dive into the black hole
# Ride - And there's a call from deep within
# I know I won't return again
# 'Cause I will dive into the black hole
# Don't wait for me, 'cause I won't come back
# Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
# Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
# Oh, oh, oh, don't wait

$ Somewhere Out In Space
# [ Music & Lyrics: Hansen ]
# I'm trapped in a castle of illusionsout in space, - no more illusions -
# Out in a jorney, on a mission for the human race
# Terrified. I had to realise that I've been takin' to the goods of fire
# I got nowhere to stand, 'cause I'm a running man... to get away
# All that I see is the years... somewhere out in space
# And it's time for deliverance
# Tomorrow, I'll see it, another day's rise ... right before my eyes
# Been sinking in sorrow, but now I'm gonna rise
# No more reasons why
# I'm a watcher in the dark, I'm so cold inside my heart
# I'm a temple in the storm, and I'm bound to be reborn
# Take me down to the underground, let me see the gods of fire
# 'Cause I'm know where they live and I know where they stand,
# Another reason there to leave
# Take me down, take me down, take me to the underground
# I wanna meet the gods of fire
# And all of their intention is the center of it all
# All that I see is the years ... somewhere out in space
# and it's time for deliverance
# Now that I know I've got to get away
# Time for deliverance now
# And as the sun appeared, up in the sky
# I saw another day,that's drifting by
# I saw my people cry, a million tears
# Into eternity they disappeared
# [ Solo: Kai / Both / Both left and right / Kai / Both ]
# Now it's time to say goodbye, or we will sink in sorrow
# No, we don't know the reason why, another day, tomorrow
# Oh, thank you for giving me hope
# Oh, follow me into a new life
# All tha I see is the years, all that I see is the tears
# All that I se is the years ... somewhere out in space
# And it's time for deliverance
# All that I see is the fear ... somewhere out in space
# And it's time for deliverance
# I wanna know how to get away, I wanna know how to get away
# Come set me free, just set me free, just let me go
# I wanna get away, get away
# Somwhere out in space

# 'Cos I made a stupid mistake
# A stupid mistake
# She was kind of exciting
# A little crazy I should have known
# She must have altered my senses
# I offered to walk her home
# The situation got out of hand
# I hope you understand
# Stupid mistake
# She means nothing to me

# Well you and I
# We're buddies
# And we've been since we first met
# Me any you
# Well we've sure been through
# Our share of laughter and regret
# Lord knows we've had our bad days
# And more than once we've disagreed
# But you've always been a friend to me
# You can be so stubborn
# There's times I think you just like to fight
# And I hope and pray
# I live to see a day
# When you say I might be right
# And there's times I'd rather kill you
# Than listen to your honesty
# But you've always been a friend to me
# You've always been
# Time and again
# The one to take my hand
# And show to me it's okay to be
# Just the way I am
# With no apology
# Oh you've always been

# Oh, the snowflakes fell in silence
# Over Belleau Wood that night
# For a Christmas truce had been declared
# By both sides of the fight
# As we lay there in our trenches
# The silence broke in two
# By a German soldier singing
# A song that we all knew
# Though I did not know the language
# The song was "Silent Night"
# Then I heard my buddy whisper,
# "All is calm and all is bright"
# Then the fear and doubt surrounded me
# 'Cause I'd die if I was wrong
# But I stood up on my trench
# And I began to sing along
# Then across the frozen battlefield
# Another's voice joined in
# Until one by one each man became
# A singer of the hymn
# Then I thought that I was dreaming
# For right there in my sight
# Stood the German soldier
# 'Neath the falling flakes of white
# And he raised his hand and smiled at me
# As if he seemed to say
# Here's hoping we both live
# To see us find a better way
# Then the devil's clock struck midnight
# And the skies lit up again
# And the battlefield where heaven stood
# Was blown to hell again
# But for just one fleeting moment
# The answer seemed so clear
# Heaven's not beyond the clouds
# It's just beyond the fear
# No' heaven's not beyond the clouds

# His pulpit's a corner
# On 19th and Main
# His grip on the gospel
# His one claim to fame
# He hurls fire and brimstone
# At the cars passing by
# And he offers salvation
# For the savior on high
# His khakis are tattered
# And he ain't bathed in weeks
# His bout with the bottle
# Shows up on his cheeks
# He looks like a scarecrow
# A sight to behold
# As he works for the shepherd
# Bringin' lambs to the fold
# He points to the Bible
# He holds in his hands
# Says I'm proof that the good Lord
# Can save any man
# Son, it ain't what you're driving
# Or the clothes that you wear
# Material possessions
# Won't matter up there
# And someday in heaven
# When the angels all sing
# These rags that I'm wearin'
# Will be fit for a king
# He's fighting a fever
# In spite of the chill
# He pull up his collar
# And he speaks of God's will
# His body is weakened
# But his faith is still strong
# For he's filled with conviction
# For the mission he's on
# He knows soon in heaven
# He'll be homeless no more
# As his work will soon echo
# From that far distant shore
# Son, it ain't what you're driving
# Or the clothes that you wear
# Material possessions
# Won't matter up there
# And someday in heaven

# I showed up in boots
# And ruined your black tie affair
# The last one to know
# The last one to show
# I was the last one
# You thought you'd see there
# And I saw the surprise
# And the fear in his eyes
# When I took his glass of champagne
# And I toasted you
# Said, honey, we may be through
# But you'll never hear me complain
# CHORUS:
# 'Cause I've got friends in low places
# Where the whiskey drowns
# And the beer chases my blues away
# And I'll be okay
# I'm not big on social graces
# Think I'll slip on down  to the oasis
# Oh, I've got friends in low places
# Well, I guess I was wrong
# I just don't belong
# But then, I've been there before
# Everything's all right
# I'll just say goodnight
# And I'll show myself to the door
# Hey, I didn't mean to cause a big scene
# Just give me an hour and then
# Well, I'll be as high

# Drove to the church
# In my suit and tie
# But I just couldn't bring myself
# To go inside
# So I sat alone
# In my truck across the street
# Watched that chauffeur smokin' cigarettes
# By that long white limousine
# I could just imagine
# What was goin' on in there
# Sunlight screamin' through the stained glass
# And those flowers in her hair
# And in less time than it takes a tear to fall
# Those bells rang loud as thunder
# As they opened up the doors
# Now I don't have to wonder anymore
# Laughin' and a cryin'
# Tossin' that bouquet
# And when you got in that limo
# I drove off the other way
# And I still don't know
# Why things happened like they did
# But I parked that old pickup
# On that lonesome river bridge
# I took your ring from my pocket
# An d I held it one last time
# Watched that diamond sparkle
# I drew back and I let her fly
# And in less time than it takes to tear to fall
# Oh that old ring went under
# And now it's gone for sure
# And I don't have to wonder anymore
# Well the angels sang like thunder
# As I felt myself go under
# Now I don't have to wonder anymore

# It's a song that I sing when there's no one around
# This is the man that nobody sees

# A tape of my failures
# Playin' inside my head

# And things I don't know

# If he could learn how to fly he'd never touch down
# He's the kid that I am when there's no one around
# This is the dance I do every day
# I let my feet go and get carried away
# I let my soul lead and follow the sound

# This is how love was to me
# I could look and not see
# Going through the emotions
# Not knowin' what they mean
# And it scared me so much
# That I just wouldn't budge
# I might have stayed there forever
# If not for your touch
# Oh but you move me
# Out of myself and into the fire
# You move me
# Now I'm burning with love
# And with hope and desire
# How you move me
# You go whistling in the dark
# Making light of it
# Making light of it
# And I follow with my heart
# Laughing all the way
# Oh 'cause you move me
# You get me dancing and you
# make me sing
# You move me
# Now I'm taking delight
# In every little thing
# How you move me

# Buenos noches senorita, I'm mighty pleased to meet ya
# Maybe you and I could sit a spell and talk
# I'm new to Santa Fe, I just rode into town today
# Thought I'd spend some time in these adobe walls
# It's dark in this cantina, it's a wonder that I seen ya
# Sittin' without any company at all
# I was wondering if we might dance away this lonely night
# Like two shadows on these old adobe walls
# I hear Celito Lindo softly playing
# As I take you in my arms and hold you close
# Though I don't understand a word you're saying
# Your brown eyes tell me all I need to know
# These walls have stood for ages and though time still turns its pages
# Hearts are still the same when night begins to fall
# Sure as there are stars above we're not the first to fall in love
# That's the magic of these old adobe walls
# I hear Celito Lindo softly playing
# As I take you in my arms and hold you close
# Though I don't understand a word you're saying

# Hearts are still the same when night begins to fall

# That no man in a weak state could outrun
# I tried to think what a gentleman would say
# Turnin' that kind of opportunity away
# I tried my best to tell her I'm not the right one
# Like no man in his wrong heart would've done
# I said no ma'am
# Like no man would've said if he wasn't in love
# With you the way I am
# It could've been easy for me to be a gooner
# But something a whole lot stronger made me run
# Like no man in his wrong heart would've done.
# Didn't want her to think that I wasn't flattered
# Her interest in me, believe me it mattered
# So I dropped several quarters in the old jukebox
# I said I want you to dance all night on me

$ Alright Guy
# I was lost in trouble and strife, I heard a voice and it changed my life
# And now it's a brand new day, and I ain't afraid to say
# You're not alone when you're down and out
# And I think you know who I'm talking about
# When I don't know how I'll get through
# I ask myself what would Willie do
# What would Willie do, well he'd travel so far with nothing but a song and his old guitar
# And a tour bus and some semi-trucks, thirty crew men and a little bit of luck
# Well he loves all the people, the ugly and the randy
# If you don't believe me take a look at the family
# And they'll tell you that it's true
# When skies are gray what would Willie do
# Well long ago he came unto us, his words were simple but they went right through us
# And the whole world sang along, but then they didn't want to hear his songs
# He was gone and we thought we'd lost him
# But he grew his hair and he moved to Austin
# And all of the people smiled, they came to hear him sing from miles
# Like a miracle all those rednecks and hippies
# From New York City down to Mississippi
# Stood together and raised a brew
# When it's all gone wrong what would Willie do
# You know sometimes I wonder when I ain't gettin' nowhere
# What would old Willie do when it all gets too much to bear
# And I can see him on his lonely old tour bus
# And he's got his problems just like any of us
# Well he'd just take a deep breath and then he'd let it all go
# And he'd take another deep breath and let it all go
# And he'd take another deep breath...and he'd hold it
# Ah and I bet he'd feel hungry in a way that seems strange
# Yeah hungry for all the things that he just can't change
# Like the time he passed out in is own bedroom
# And his wife sewed him up in the sheets and beat him with a broom and he forgave her
# And you think that's rough, well then the IRS came and they took away all of his stuff
# They took his golf course and his recording studio, and he just went out and did another show
# So when it's all coming down on you
# You better ask yourself what would Willie do
# What would Willie do, well he'd take a little time
# And talk to old rooser as he'd drive on down the line
# And there's millions down that road, and with a word he's gonna lighten their load
# He loves all the people no matter their races
# Hell he even had a hit country song with Julio Iglesias
# And that ain't easy to do, so when it's all too much, what would Willie
# When the game gets tough what would Willie
# When they call your bluff what would Willie do

# Dove sarai, anima mia non lo vedi che io vivo di te, dove sarai. . .
# Sai che ti vedo ancora nei miei occhi se mi specchio, eri tutto ciò che io stavo cercando
# e intanto tu resti la musa che ispira i miei testi o i miei discorsi tradotti in versi,
# poli opposti attratti da uno sguardo che brilla, in te vedevo sai l'unica conferma,
# ora e per sempre sei la mia storia importante tra tante, ora una stella cadente contiene un desiderio
# cielo aperto e il tuo ricordo viaggia in me come un brutto sogno che si porta via con se
# la tua immagine si perde in quella foto tra le fiamme di un camino che adesso brucia solitudine
# e non è facile dimenticare tutto adesso, sei la mia piccola ti penso
# anche se ho perso la ragione per cui tutto questo aveva un senso, mi chiedo. . .
# Dove sarai anima mia, senza di te mi butto via
# dove sarai (ti cerco e capirai)
# anima bella (anima bella),
# stella gemella (brilla per me)
# dove sarai
# E' strano come stuzzichi la mia memoria guardare le stelle,
# dona luce nuova ad ogni mio fotogramma ribelle
# penso ad una scelta sciocca, un filo d'erba in bocca
# abbandonato in un prato questa ferita aperta ancora scotta
# un'altra volta una cotta spenta in fretta, non riesco a fare il fidanzato cerco un'amante perfetta
# che sia la musica che ha il battito giusto per me
# sò bene che sarebbe l'unica quando so che lei c'è
# altrimenti questo qui chi se lo prende, mai abbastanza presente sempre cocciuto se sceglie
# con la mia stravagante vita da cantante volente o nolente una mente eternamente adolescente
# ciò che mi aspetta sarà vero sarà un altro miraggio scomparso a contatto con questa realtà

# When the sun shines on the mountains
# And the night is on the run
# It's a new day, it's a new way
# And I fly up to the sun
# I can feel the morning sunlight
# I can smell the new-born hay
# I can hear God's voices calling
# From my golden sky-light way
# Una paloma blanca
# I'm just a bird in the sky
# Una paloma blanca
# Over the mountain I fly
# No one can take my freedom away
# Once I had my share of losing
# Once they locked me on a chain
# Yes, they tried to break my power
# Oh, I still can feel the pain
# Una paloma blanca
# I'm just a bird in the sky
# Una paloma blanca
# Over the mountain I fly
# No one can take my freedom away

# Teach them well and let them lead the way
# Show them all the beauty they possess inside
# Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
# Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
# Everybody is searching for a hero
# People need someone to look up to
# I never found anyone to fulfill my needs
# A lonely place to be
# So I learned to depend on me
# Chorus:
# I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
# If I fail, if I succeed
# At least I live as I believe
# No matter what they take from me
# They can't take away my dignity
# Because the greatest love of all
# Is happening to me
# I found the greatest love of all
# Inside of me
# The greatest love of all
# Is easy to achieve
# Learning to love yourself
# It is the greatest love of all
# I believe the children are our future
# Teach them well and let them lead the way
# Show them all the beauty they possess inside
# Give them a sense of pride to make it easier

# Beside me in some field
# Said a prayer, and let him go

# I can't light no more of your darkness
# All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
# I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
# Frozen here on the ladder of my life
# It's much to late to save myself from falling
# I took a chance and changed your way of fife
# But you misread my meaning when i met you
# Closed the door and left me blinded by the light
# Don't let the sun go down on me
# Although i search myself, it's always someone else i see
# I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
# But losing everything is like the sun going down on me
# I can't find oh, the right romantic line
# But see me once and see the way i feel
# Don't discard me just because you think i mean you harm
# But these cuts i have, oh they need love to help them heal
# Don't let the sun go down on me
# Although i search myself, it's always someone else i see
# I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
# But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

# Well I guess it would be nice
# If I could touch your body
# I know not everybody
# Has got a body like you
# But I've got to think twice
# Before I give my heart away
# And I know all the games you play
# Because I play them too
# Oh but I
# Need some time off from that emotion
# Time to pick my heart up off the floor
# And when that love comes down
# Without devotion
# Well it takes a strong man baby
# But I'm showing you the door
# 'Cause I gotta have faith...
# Baby
# I know you're asking me to stay
# Say please, please, please, don't go away
# You say I'm giving you the blues
# Maybe
# You mean every word you say
# Can't help but think of yesterday
# And another who tied me down to loverboy rules
# Before this river
# Becomes an ocean
# Before you throw my heart back on the floor
# Oh baby I reconsider
# My foolish notion
# Well I need someone to hold me

# It stayed with me, it keeps messing with my head

# Then how come John & Elvis are dead?"
# Youth, beautiful youth
# We walked through the walls until we found the truth
# And said "Change it, it's ugly just change it"
# Everyone we used to know
# Must have given up, so long ago
# You can see it, it's written on their faces
# And the inside of their clothes
# But the words that made me cry
# 'Cos I knew just what they meant
# He turned to me and said
# "Hey boy, if Jesus Christ is alive and well
# Then how come John & Elvis are dead?"

# A time to turn your eyes away
# Is there a time for keeping your head down

# Is there a time for kohl and lipstick
# A time for cutting hair
# Is there a time for high street shopping
# To find the right dress to wear
# Here she comes
# Heads turn around
# Here she comes
# To take her crown
# Is there a time to walk for cover
# A time for kiss and tell
# Is there a time for different colors
# Different names you find it hard to spell
# Is there a time for first communion
# A time for east 17
# Is there a time to turn the mecca
# Is there a time to be a beauty queen

# Oh she knows
# She takes his hand
# And prays the child will understand
# At the door they watch the men go by
# In the clothes that daddy wore
# Mothers pride
# Baby boy
# His father's eyes
# He's a soldier waiting for war
# Time will come
# He'll hold a gun
# His father's son
# And as he grows
# He hears the band
# Takes the step from boy to man
# And at the shore she waves her son goodbye
# Like the man she did before
# Mothers pride
# Just a boy
# His country's eyes
# He's a soldier waving at the shore
# And in her heart the time has come
# To lose a son
# And all the husbands, all the sons, all the lovers gone
# They make no difference
# No difference in the end
# Still hear the woman say your daddy died a hero
# In the name of god and man
# Mothers pride
# Crazy boy

# He's a soldier now forevermore

# And the satellite says, "Take a look at all we have"
# But the old man says,
# "You want my family, for your liberty...I can't do that."
# Look into the eyes of any patient man
# Whether they be amber, green or blue,
# There's a piece of God staring back at you
# But they see our children, and the old folk fend for themselves
# They see our broken women
# On imaginary shelves

# Precious keeps me company
# Keeps me from being alone
# Because no-one comes in the morning
# No-one comes in the evening time
# I'd sit and wait for the phone to ring
# I could be waiting my whole damn life
# So sick of the same old faces
# In this street, where nobody talks to me
# And the funny side of the situation is
# I don't care, I'll always be there
# When you come down from the sky
# And make yourself at home
# In my house
# Because these days it's the money the money
# The money, honey, or your life
# I said don't you know you can't have both
# Stop acting so dumb

# You may want to let me in
# You may want to sacrifice

# If you've got something to say
# Why don't you say it
# If you've got something to give
# Why don't you give it to me
# Day after day i have to say it
# We're moving further from heaven
# And closer to the deep blue sea
# 'Cause i have no secrets from you
# And i have nothing left to hide
# And i'm open to all your questions
# Why can't you reach inside
# Like i have
# Like i have for you
# And all these games that you play
# Don't tell me how a man should be
# Some would say if you knew
# You wouldn't be here with me
# I love you
# I still love you
# But i guess it's time to let you be
# 'Cause i have no secrets from you
# And i have nothing left to hide
# And i'm so tired of all these questions
# 'Cause maybe you just changed your mind
# Like i have
# Like i have
# Like i have
# Like i have
# When i was at your doorstep
# You told me to look around
# Said come in
# You and your heart sit down
# But you'd better watch your step
# 'Cause you're not far from the ground
# And one fine day this all falls down
# Like i have

# When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids

# Better sit back and go - with the flow

# They've flown in the swiftness of time

# She'll cut up your heart like an' old credit card,
# When the fun and the money runs out.
# You're a fool if you saddle yourself to a high-tone woman. (I seen her.)
# I've seen her cut up a heart like an' old credit card,
# When the fun and the money runs out.
# I've never seen an uptown, well-read thorougbred,
# High-tone woman sink as low as you.
# Oh no, I've never seen an uptown, well-read thorougbred,
# High-tone woman sink as low as you.

# He was sitting there beside me throwing doubles down
# When he ordered up his third one he looked around
# Then he looked at me, said I do believe I'll have one more
# He said I hate this bar and I hate to drink
# But on second thought tonight I think I hate everything
# Then he opened up his bill-fold and threw a 20 down
# And the faded photograph fell out and hit the ground
# And I picked it up, he said thank you bud, I put it in his hand
# He said I probably ought to throw this one away
# 'Cause she's the reason I feel this way, I hate everything
# Chorus:
# I hate my job, I hate my life and if it weren't for my two kids I'd hate my ex-wife
# I know I should move on and try to start again
# But I just can't get over her leaving me for him
# Then he shook his head and looked down at his ring and said I hate everything
# He said one bedroom apartment where I get my mail
# Is really not a home, it's more like a jail
# With a swimming pool and a parking lot view, man that's just great
# I hate summer, winter, fall and spring
# Red and yellow, purple, blue and green, I hate everything
# Chorus:
# So I pulled out my phone and I called my house
# Said babe I'm home home, we're gonna work this out
# I paid for his drinks and I told him thanks, thanks for everything

# I don't want to be the kind to hesitate
# Be too shy
# Wait too late
# I don't care what they say other lovers do
# I just want to dance with you
# I got a feeling that you have a heart like mine
# So let it show
# Let it shine
# If we have a chance to make one heart of two
# Then I just want to dance with you
# CHORUS:
# I want to dance with you
# Twirl you all around the floor
# That's what they inteneded dancing for
# I just want to dance with you
# I want to dance with you
# Hold you in my arms once more
# That's what they invented dancing for
# I just want to dance with you
# I caught you lookin' at me
# When I looked at you
# Yes I did
# Ain't that true
# You won't get embarrassed by the things I do
# I just want to dance with you
# Oh the boys are playing softly
# And the girls are too
# So am I and so are you
# If this was a movie we'd be right on cue
# I just want to dance with you

# If the whole world was a honky-tonk,
# And it revolved around an old jukebox,
# We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,
# Over cryin' steel guitars,
# And soon, they'd all be gone.
# Yeah, if you asked me what I thought,
# I'd say: 'We'd be better off,
# 'If the whole world was a honky-tonk.'
# You could smoke that cigarette,
# An' be politically incorrect.
# Show off that red 'round your neck:
# Not hear a single soul object.
# Wouldn't need no lawyers to decide,
# Who is wrong and who is right.
# No need for big expensive trials:
# Brother, we'd just step outside.
# If the whole world was a honky-tonk,
# And it revolved around an old jukebox,
# We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,

# And soon, they'd all be gone.
# Yeah, if you asked me what I thought,
# I'd say: 'We'd be better off,
# 'If the whole world was a honky-tonk.'
# Wouldn't have to pay no tax:
# Just set a tip jar in the back.
# If we ran low, we'd pass the hat:
# I bet we'd all be in the black,
# If the whole world was a honky-tonk.
# And if you're lookin' love:
# Someone to heal that broken heart.
# Hey, buddy, you'd be in half.
# You wouldn't have to go that far.
# If the whole world was a honky-tonk,
# And it revolved around an old jukebox,
# We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,

# I couldn't help but overhear your conversation

# You say you've got her wrapped around your finger
# But there's something about angels you should know
# CHORUS:
# She'll walk away one step at a time
# It'll take you by surprise
# You'll think it happened over night
# It'll be too late when you realize angels don't fly
# They walk away one step at a time
# Don't think I'm trying to mind your business
# It's a full time job just trying to mind mine
# But I once had an angel just like her

# Girl you were always my yellow rose
# And I was your one lone star
# We always said
# Together til death do us part
# We had a love bigger than Texas
# Where is that feeling now
# It's taken some hits and some losses but its fighting on
# And standing somehow
# CHORUS:
# Remember the man who asked for your hand
# In the moonlight of San Antone
# There by the mission you let your position be known
# That you loved me so
# Don't forget where it started
# Remember the Alamo
# I think we can hold on and make it together
# If we remember when
# And get back to love
# The way that it was back then
# When we were hopeless romantics needing each other
# Willing to take a chance
# We strolled and we talked down the ol' river walk
# To the heart of where it began

# He wondered how she'd take it when he said goodbye.
# Thought she might do some cryin': lose some sleep at night.
# But he had no idea, when he hit the road,
# That without him in her life, she'd let herself go.
# Let herself go on a singles cruise,
# To Vegas once, then to Honolulu.
# Let herself go to New York City:
# A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty.
# When he said he didn't love her no more,
# She let herself go.
# She poured her heart an' soul into their three-bedroom ranch.
# Spent her days raisin' babies, ironin' his pants.
# Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note,
# And without him there to stop her, she let herself go.
# Let herself go on her first blind-date:
# Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake.
# Let herself go, buy a brand new car,
# Drove down to the beach he always said was too far.
# Sand sure felt good between her toes:
# She let herself go on a singles cruise,
# To Vegas once, then to Honolulu.
# Let herself go to New York City:
# A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty.
# When he said he didn't love her no more,
# She let herself go.
# To Vegas once: Honolulu, New York City.
# Came back knocked-out pretty

# I left, out of Tucson, with no destination in mind.
# I was runnin' from trouble and the jail-term the Judge had in mind.
# And the border meant freedom, a new life, romance,
# And that's why I thought I should go,
# And start my life over on the seashores of old Mexico.
# My first night in Juarez, lost all the money I had.
# One bad senorita made use of one innocent lad.
# But I must keep on runnin'; it's too late to turn back:
# I'm wanted in Tucson, I'm told.
# Yeah, an' things'll blow over on the seashores of old Mexico.
# Two Mexican farmers en route to a town I can't say,
# Let me ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay.
# Down through Durango, Colima, Almiera,
# Then in the Manzanillos,
# Where I slept on the seashores of old Mexico.
# After one long siesta, I came wide awake in the night.
# I was startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight.
# My new-found companion, one young senorita,
# Who offered a broken hello,
# To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico.
# She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return,
# For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern.
# 'Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo:
# That's all I needed to know.
# Yeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of old Mexico.
# Yeah, she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo:
# That's all I needed to know, ha, ha.

# True in this modern world when two lovers get together
# Chances of 'em making it to forever
# Couldn't be better than two in a million hearts
# Girl this ain't just another run of the mill emotion
# What I'm feeling is devotion
# My love for you is true
# CHORUS:
# True like the sun comin' up each morning
# Bright as a light in a baby's smile
# Sure as a mountain river windin'
# Right as the rain fallin' from the sky
# Girl my love for you is true
# True, not another minute on this earth can be borrowed
# So there's no way to know when I'll live my last tommorow
# But everyday I get, I'll share with you
# This feelin' just keeps gettin' stronger as time goes by
# It's written on my face, you can see it in my eyes
# My love for you is true
# REPEAT CHORUS TWICE

# We really shouldn't be doing this
# And we both know why
# Just being close enough to think like this
# Enough to make you need to lie
# This kinda talk will lead us to somewhere
# We're gettin' way too close to going there
# The farther off the better to resist
# We really shouldn't be doin' this
# Only an isolated incident
# But the acquaintance left me stunned
# The first attraction was the hardest hit
# I thought I'd ever overcome
# This kinda situation has to pass
# This chance encounter has to be the last
# To take it further we would be remiss
# We really shouldn't be doin' this

# Won't even think about a farewell kiss

# Is there no such a thing as the one
# They say love is blind cos the truth is unkind
# I'm just a hot-loaded gun
# There was Henry

# At the end of the day, you showed me the way
# I'm never in doubt
# Someone's watching over me
# Though sometimes I wish that you would look away from me
# Always watching over me
# Though it's not perfect, it can't be any other way for me
# You said to me that time would never wait

# To no avail, I WAS SCREAMIN OUT and nobody heard me

# We gon' -- we gon' get our money
# If he front, they gon' read about the rocks in his tummy
# Mouth was red, socks was bloody, fuck all the talkin'
# Safety off and shit, crept out, "What up money? Freeze!"
# Don't move, turn around, act like James Brown

# Faggot ass niggaz, when I ride get the fuck out the way
# When I see jewels, all I know is take

# Movin' birds and weight, through suburban states
# God damn it, I told y'all niggaz

# I'mma say it, don't get mad, y'all, I throw my darts sideways
# Shoot 'em up, bang, bang, through me baby
# Lovely lady, fuck the spades, drive the kid crazy
# Before I go to bed, an hour later
# People be talkin', I feed dolphins
# My defense'll fly the coop off your mean office
# My skills is a fortune, robbin' leech out a suite auction
# Teach then fall off the greatest, fuck what they say
# Cuz we against the abortions, and we
# Lay low-oh-oh, silent those clowin' foes
# Got them clothes for his new feud in the road
# We them Fat Albert, spot runnin' '86 crack viles and pictures
# Lookin' all suspicous, I'm out..
# [Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
# Aiyo, hold up! What the fuck you stop for?
# (I got somethin' in my--) Nah, you can't be stoppin', g
# What the fuck you ain't got -- aiyo, you buggin' and shit
# Son, you gotta hurry the fuck up
# Time is runnin' nigga, come! What the fuck??
# [Ghostface Killah]
# I work magic out of liquor store
# Give me a dollar and I turn that bitch into five
# And all I need is one more, to get things started
# Get retarded, and once you -- I'mma fix these artists
# Take 'em one by one, tie 'em up, line 'em up
# Treat 'em like a cigar, fire them niggaz up
# They be up in the club, six/three tree'd up
# With them young 'keds with their gear all beat up
# This is how I'mma kill 'em with four lines left
# Hold your breath, say my name five times it's take's practice, yo
# Decap' him with sayin' my name, it's like matches, yo
# It's time to fuck up on account in a house, or blow
# [Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
# Na-na-na-na-na, nah, nah, fuck that four-line shit

# You suppose to be that nigga, nigga then show me
# If you that nigga! Then show me, nigga!
# [Ghostface Killah]
# I hold a mic like I'm Gail Sails
# Hoppin' over chairs like O.J., my rushin' yards
# Them pen, how the meter spray
# Happy wife-beater day, don't touch my, cheeba hay
# Get off my D-I, then go C the K's (case)
# 'Scuse me Mr. D.J., please play "Fish"
# Or that "CherChez", live meeting, ten four, may day-may day
# Callin' all cars, callin' all cars
# We have an APB on Starks and Trife the God
# We left the jewelry store, feelin' like we left the morgue
# We was frozen, and I brought an iced out Trojan
# That's for pussies whose golden, who got Toney wide open
# I put my ring up to my man's waves and seen an ocean
# Move like a wolf, kid, in sheep's clothing
# Snatch the money bag off the milk truck and kept boating
# I be potent like ibuprofen, I be coastin'
# With two shotties on me, in your grimiest lobby smokin'
# [Outro: Ghostface Killah]
# This muthafucka made the clock!
# Mutha-- where the fuck?
# Yo, you be cheatin', mutha-, you be cheatin'
# That's that Staten Island, bullshit
# Theodore... you know you might be a Ghost
# But you ain't Houdini, muthafucka!

# Yo... aiyo this joint right here is about
# When you goin' through mad shit
# And it just seem like you get out of it, nowhere and shit
# You thinkin' you puttin' your shit in and you thinkin'
# You gettin' over, and doin' all this other shit

# [Ghostface Killah]
# Aiyo, back in '95 when I was jugglin' bitches
# Pumpin' coke out the spot, smackin' fiends in the kitchen
# All around dick sucks whenever, blowin' chronic out of Philly's
# Gettin' flusty in the Cub' Link era
# Niggas tellin' me my spot is hot
# They like I think any day now, playboy, shit gon' pop
# Back then I was the phat Ghost, them came March 1st
# My eighth platoon got murked, got burnt for all our work
# After the funeral, I played low, countin' my last ten g's
# Three weeks later, yo, I'm back in the P's
# Gatherin' up information, checkin' faces
# Keepin' a forty-five auto' loaded like it was bases
# When it get dark, venom will leave my mark (over)
# I heard a voice through a bullhorn, a white man he said "Yo, Starks!
# You're surrounded, put down your gun, look at the rules
# There's nothin' but cops, nigga, you better not run"
# [Interlude: Ghostface Killah *during chorus*]
# Yeah... you see how that went right?

# Verse two
# [Ghostface Killah]
# Aiyo, aiyo, 11:40 A.M. in the best Western
# I'm with my bat, blew her ass back and chest in
# Slob my knob, yeah no question, this my main bat
# She thorough like that, so we don't use protection
# But the night before, my wiz must of check my phone
# How the fuck she get the codes... I don't know
# Next thing, she layin' in the 'tel lobby, spotted me
# Tippin' the doorman, holdin' hands with my bitch besides me
# My heart drop, everything stops, scared to death
# Told my broad to keep it moving, cuz I just got knocked
# Don't turn around, as soon she did, she bust a shot
# Plus she talk, security drop when she touch the glock
# I had the gum-face on, long face on
# Didn't say shit, not even cough or spit, my bitch was gone
# There goes the car, house, rhyme boats or jewelry
# Court date judges, my shorty tried to screw me
# [Chorus 2X]
# [Interlude w/ Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
# Uh... you see, sometime it don't pay
# What goes around comes around in
# In many different ways and
# You can guess what happened
# That's right ya'll, you know how it get down
# If anybody got it locked, it's God, that's right

# Hey Kimmy, how you doing? What up Keisha
# Damn girl, your hair looks so nice
# Yeah, I got my shit done at Tasha's
# You know I don't even fuck with that bitch
# Yo, son, I think Ghost fuckin' one of them bitches, man
# And can you believe this son told them bitches that he can cook, man
# Yo, I can't believe this, these bitches don't know where to fuckin'
# Put a salon up in the fuckin' hood, son I can't even make no money no more, man
# (Yo, son... maybe you need to tell them bitches that

# Itself is lost and it's still, "Can I get a dime sack?"
# To help me focus on wealth, not material wealth
# 'Cause true wealth resides deep inside
# I put the pen to the paper and let the ink thin
# Give what it's channeling through me without no thinking
# About it, no doubt about it, part of my beating
# Came into open the spirit and let you see in
# It's time to let 'er off for now, no further seeking
# I follow it as I hear about to begin
# Follow the Light as I take you on a journey deep in
# Sound of the side of the light you might just wanna be in
# Way of the Light
# Way of the Light you wanna be in
# Heir of the Night
# Go on and flow with what you seeking
# Playing it right
# The little voice inside is speaking
# Saying it tight
# Beyond your logic and your reason
# Living and struggling everyday to make mo'
# Poor is getting poorer so niggaz just take dough
# Scratching and surviving and seein ya stay broke
# Cultivating image instead of the great soul
# Cultivate an image but it was all for show
# Blow up, explode, didn't it erupt way though
# Millions of dollars does not a mortal make whole
# You can only take what you've given away though, come on

# I got two strong arms
# Blessings of Babylon
# With time to carry on and try
# For sins and false alarms
# So to America the brave
# Wise men save
# Near a tree by a river
# There's a hole in the ground
# Where an old man of Aran
# Goes around and around
# And his mind is a beacon
# In the veil of the night
# For a strange kind of fashion
# There's a wrong and a right
# Near a tree by a river
# There's a hole in the ground
# Where an old man of Aran
# Goes around and around
# And his mind is a beacon
# In the veil of the night
# For a strange kind of fashion
# There's a wrong and a right
# But he'll never
# Never fight over you
# Near a tree by a river
# There's a hole in the ground
# Where an old man of Aran
# Goes around and around
# And his mind is a beacon
# In the veil of the night

# Goes around and around
# And his mind is a beacon
# In the veil of the night
# For a strange kind of fashion
# There's a wrong and a right
# But he'll never
# Never fight over you
# I got plans for us
# Nights in the scullery
# And days instead of me
# I only know what to discuss
# Of for anything but light
# Wise men fighting over you
# It's not me you see
# Pieces of valentine
# With just a song of mine
# To keep from burning history
# Seasons of gasoline and gold
# Wise men fold
# Near a tree by a river
# There's a hole in the ground
# Where an old man of Aran
# Goes around and around
# And his mind is a beacon
# In the veil of the night
# For a strange kind of fashion
# There's a wrong and a right
# But he'll never
# Never fight over you
# I got time to kill
# Sly looks in corridors
# Without a plan of yours
# A blackbird sings on bluebird hill
# Thanks to the calling of the wild

# Your place is mine
# Lost myself
# Inside of you
# Rocked me all night through
# Out of my bed but still in my head

# Out of my mind cause we're two of a kind
# And I need you so I won't let you go

# In a little while from now
# If I'm not feeling any less sour
# I promise myself to treat myself
# And visit a nearby tower
# And climbing to the top will throw myself off
# In an effort to make it clear to whoever
# What it's like when you're shattered
# Left standing in the lurch at a church
# Where people saying: "My God, that's tough"
# "She stood him up"
# "No point in us remaining"
# "We may as well go home"
# As I did on my own
# Alone again, naturally
# To think that only yesterday
# I was cheerful, bright and gay
# Looking forward to who wouldn't do
# The role I was about to play?
# But as if to knock me down
# Reality came around
# And without so much as a mere touch
# Cut me into little pieces
# Leaving me to doubt
# Talk about God in His mercy
# Who if He really does exist
# Why did He desert me?
# In my hour of need
# I truly am indeed
# Alone again, naturally
# It seems to me that there are more hearts
# Broken in the world that can't be mended
# Left unattended
# What do we do? What do we do?
# Alone again, naturally
# Looking back over the years
# And whatever else that appears
# I remember I cried when my father died
# Never wishing to hide the tears
# And at sixty-five years old
# My mother, God rest her soul
# Couldn't understand why the only man
# She had ever loved had been taken
# Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
# Despite encouragement from me
# No words were ever spoken
# And when she passed away
# I cried and cried all day
# Alone again, naturally
# Alone again, naturally

# Till the day you pounded on my heart's door,

# And you're free to love,
# Cause I've given you My love,
# and it's made you free
# I have set you free
# My mind finds hard to believe

# Because You loved me so.
# And my heart cannot understand
# Why You'd accept me as I am,
# But You say You've always had a plan,
# And that's all I need to know.
# So when I am consumed by what the world will say,

# I want you to stay
# You can say I'm trippin' but I'm stingy
# And I can't hide it

# e inizio a danzare sul mondo,
# che più mi interessa.
# mi sento baciare la pelle affamata di nei
# e inizio a cadere nel fango, nel fango, nel fango
# aiutami, aiutami affacciati e prendimi al volo
# aiutami, aiutami sorridimi che... volo
# mi sento cadere
# c'e' fumo qui dentro la stanza
# e inizio a conoscere il fondo,
# che più mi imprigiona
# mi sento baciare
# le labbra bagnate di te
# e inizio a morire di pianto,

# Questo è il prezzo che questo mondo impone a noi
# Di vivere senza certezza alcuna...
# In bilico nel blu e disperati amanti che non mai trovato amore puro
# Piegati alle regole del buon mercato
# Mi pento mi dolgo per questo peccato
# Ma quando respiro mi accorgo che esisto davvero
# E stiamo isolati in cerca di gloria mediocri e muti e senza memoria
# Ma guarda l'estate è tornata speranza c'è ancora..
# Ti prego vivi... vivi... vivi... davvero...
# vivi... vivi... vivi davvero... davvero...
# Questo è il prezzo che questo tempo impone a noi
# Velocemente vivere una vita
# Il frutto del peccato una donna l'ha mangiato
# Adesso io vorrei un pezzo di torta
# Piegati alle regole del buon partito
# Nessun pregiudizio è mai stato sanato
# Raccontami quello che fai per dormire la notte
# Illusi delusi dal senso di colpa
# Costretti da una morale distorta
# Ma fuori c'è un mondo di anime salve davvero
# Ti prego vivi... vivi... vivi... davvero... davvero

# When I was only six years old, I was kicked around at school,
# I used to try to close my eyes and hide.
# And when I finally told my Dad, he said "Kids can be so cruel",
# They don't really care what lies inside.
# I'm gonna wait a while, have some fun, take my time,
# I'm in no rush to make you mine, oh mine.
# And when it happens, baby, you can take me anywhere,
# The sky could fall on us and I won't care.
# Chorus :
# Because we're young, free and happy,
# No need to be down, troubled or sad.
# Coz when you're young, free and happy,
# You know it's the best thing that you'll ever have.
# I was only sweet sixteen when my Momma told me a story,
# About the birds and the bees and everything.
# You got plenty of years to decide, so I advise you not to ignore me,
# Boys are only after just one thing.
# (Bridge)
# (Chorus)
# It was 1999 when a stranger said to me,
# "You wanna come with me and dance and sing?" (yeah).
# When I asked my Mum and Dad, they said, "If that's what you wanna be",
# I left home and that changed everything.
# What did she say? - And she told me to never let a chance go by,
# What did he say? - And he told me, so now, baby's not goodbye.
# What did they say? - And they told me I'll be forever by your side,
# What did they say? What did they say?
# (Chorus) x 3

# When it comes to love there's no easy answer
# Only you can say what you're gonna do
# I heard you on the phone
# You took his number
# Said you weren't alone
# That you'd call him soon
# Isn't he the guy
# Guy who left you cryin'
# Isn't he the one who made you blue
# When you remember those nights in his arms
# You know you gotta make up your mind
# Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
# Or one you goin' back to the one you love
# Someone's gonna cry when they know they've lost you
# Someone's gonna thank the stars above
# What you gonna say when he comes over
# There's no easy way to see this through
# All the broken dreams
# All the disappiontment
# Oh girl what you gonna do
# Your heart keeps sayin'
# It's just not fair
# But still you gonna make up your mind

# Or one you goin' back to the one you love
# Someone's gonna cry when they know they've lost you

# I've been angry
# And I have strayed
# I've said words I never thought
# That I could say
# And you were sad and sweet
# Like an old folk song
# But I'll be back up on my feet
# Before too long
# You could say you wanted me
# If I said it first
# The words rang hollow
# And the emptiness became a thirst
# Now I could drink those words
# They would make me strong
# And I'd be back up on my feet
# Before too long
# If you'd met me now
# You never would have stuck around
# No, you never would have stuck around
# So I will lay me down
# By the salty sea
# And let the water pull the sand
# Over my body
# To wash me clean
# Like a river stone
# And I'll be back up on my feet
# Before you know it
# I'll be back up on my feet
# Before too long

# You grew up alone in a big empty house
# With a pool and a maid, Mom and Dad always out
# And I always thought that you had it so good
# Just imagine my surprise when they blew off the roof
# And I couldn't be more careless
# You're probably dead and I'm just embarrassed
# From out of the fire and into a flame
# When you got too skinny you moved to LA
# Just a regular city dropped from a great height
# With the millions inside just along for the ride
# And I couldn't be more careless
# You're probably dead and I'm just embarrassed
# To be the one who had it nice
# With not a clue and too much advice
# Well, I'll let you live your life like you let me live mine
# So whatever you need it's just fine, it's just fine
# You've been here before, you'll probably be back again
# 'Till the hair of that dog is too frayed at both ends
# And I couldn't be more careless
# You're probably dead and I'm just embarrassed

# There comes a time in life
# To pull on your coat and go outside
# To taste the vinegar of life, bitter life
# To taste a second time, its sweet surprise
# Sweet surprise
# It's not that hard to figure it out
# When there's no question, there's no doubt
# I burned an effigy to time, senseless time
# To view the miracle, but the wine still was wine
# And that was my crime
# There is a face in the stone
# We let it out to find its form
# To shape the testament of will, strongest will
# Pride, humility, a bitter pill
# Bitter pill
# Sweet surrender, oh my Lord
# I never thought I'd see
# Not surprising, still I find
# I'm shaking, crying
# But I'm laughing, softly
# There comes a time in the life
# To pull on your coat and go outside

# Been waiting
# To find
# You could've been happier
# Given the time
# If he'd make up his mind
# You'd give yourself to anybody
# Who would cross that line
# chorus:
# And it was never question
# He was crowing for repair
# You'd give him love and affection
# But you couldn't keep him there
# Get over regrets
# While you were sleeping with the angels
# He was under the bed
# And the more skin
# That you shed
# The more that the air in your throat will linger
# When you call him your friend
# chorus
# Staring at a cold little hand
# Reading fault lines
# Of a shell of a man
# You were waiting for a word from above
# Wouldn't you know it
# No answer ever did come
# And it was never question
# You were crowing for repair
# You'd give him love and affection
# But you couldn't keep him there

# It this place that makes me fall from you
# Forget the words that once rang so true
# Did we expect that life was ever fair, my god...
# I sowed a field of rose and reaped a whipping rod
# And everything I've held too tight inside
# Could make a part of me die
# And if my lips could only speak the name
# The dam would break
# What is this ice that gathers round my heart
# To stop the flood of warmth before it even starts
# It would make me blind to what I thought would always be
# The only constant in the world for me
# And every hours of every day
# I need to fight from pulling away
# And if my mind could only loose the chain
# The dam would break
# For all the things I hid away
# And all the words I could not say
# The dam would break
> Glen Phillips
# If I lose my faith
# Just remind me, just remind me
# When my shadow's longer
# Stay beside me till it's brighter
# How easy I forget
# How beautiful to see you once again
# In my darkest hour I will be freed
# When I close my eyes
# I hope to find you, I hope to find you
# When I leave my body
# I want to be ready, willing like you were
# I sat beside you then
# I felt the warmth as it left your hands
# In my darkest hour I will be freed
# I've been waiting so long
# That waiting was the end
# Let this sleeper awaken again
# In my darkest hour I will be freed

# I was the driver for the drive-by of the neighbor's dog
# Dad had always hated him and he said 'Come on son,
# 'Get into the Vega now and I'll go get my shotgun'
# It was a military holiday and kids were everywhere
# I hid behind the steering wheel and tried to disappear
# I tried to speak but couldn't, Dad was whistling and drinking beer
# And I prayed 'Dear God, if You save this dog
# 'I will never get high, I will never jack off
# 'I will do all the things that I should but have not
# 'I'll be a good boy from now on'
# We turned around the corner soon and saw the neighbor's yard
# Dad lit up a cigarette and rolled his window down
# And grinning like an idiot he stuck his head and body out
# And I prayed 'Dear God, if You save this dog
# 'I will never get high, I will never jack off
# 'I will be all the things that I should but have not
# 'I'll be a good boy from now on'
# Well he popped in a shell and took aim with the gun
# Then a flash and a bang and the dog it was gone. . .
# Jumped up and he ran away
# Dad had shot right through his chain
# Dad said 'Take me to the Dairy Freeze, I want to have a shake'
# We sipped them on the benches there and stared out on the lake
# And Dad has never said another word about that day
# And I hope you're not disappointed, God
# 'Cause I still get high and I still jack off
# And you knew I was lying but you still saved that dog
# You're such a good God
# Such a good, good God
# You're such a good goddamned backwards dog

# Bring a lantern with you
# It gets dark in places
# Walk up the escalator
# To the section that was kidswear

# The water's getting deeper and I can't feel my feet

# She came from Austin, Texas, she liked his custom van
# And his pit bull Francis
# Even when he took a chunk out of her hand
# They liked to dance in the desert and screw in the sand
# He said they'd always be together
# But when her belly got big she never saw him again
# One and one ends up to be three
# Don't need to have love don't need to be sweet
# When the air gets heavy and it's hard to breathe
# The women get stuck, the men just leave
# They were high school sweethearts from Portland, Maine
# He was a writer's block poet
# And though she'd never read a line she still had faith
# They ended up in La Jolla, she sold Mary Kay
# He dreamed about getting published
# And when her belly got big he ran away
# One and one ends up to be three
# Don't need to have love don't need to be sweet
# When the air gets heavy and it's hard to breathe
# The women get stuck, the men just leave
# There's a place in the desert where the men all meet
# Park their vans in the shade
# Talk about Kerouac and the works of the Beats
# Let their dogs play together, they drink beer and they sing
# They've all got a secret treasure
# The wallet picture in their pocket
# Of the kid they never see

# You all went away and left me alone
# And now there's nobody around any more
# Just a big empty house on a big empty street
# In a big empty town in a big empty state
# The radio's dead and the streets are blocked off
# I'm through smashing windows and trying to get lost
# I read a few books, but it just made me sad
# There's nobody to talk to about what I read
# Heaven knows why I'm alive
# Heaven knows what keeps me here
# There is nothing that can keep me down
# There is nothing left to fear
# It's my town now, my own town
# It's my town now, but I wish you were here
# I'm wondering if I should learn how to fly
# A police helicopter would be a good way to die
# I'd be a fireball come crashing, leaving nothing but ashes
# A bald spot on the globe like nothing ever had happened here
# Heaven knows why I'm alive
# But heaven it can't keep me here
# There is nothing that can keep me down
# There is nothing left to fear
# It's my town now, my own town

# Well it took five neighbors
# To get him in the hall
# And down the three flights of stairs
# Out the building's door
# I know that it's easy to say
# That it couldn't be worse
# But now she's in her apartment
# Alone for the first time since the last jerk
# And once you let them get to you
# It never washes off
# 'Cause they can smell the weak ones
# And just pick you off like a pigeon
# And each one is worse than the last one
# Until you're a professional victim
# You get everything backwards
# Learning how to survive
# You treat the little wounds first
# Let the big ones fester for life
# You've done it enough
# You would think that you know what you need
# But it doesn't get any better
# When you've got such an eye for the bad seed
# And once you let them get to you
# It never washes off
# 'Cause they can smell the weak ones
# And just pick you off like a pigeon
# And each one is worse than the last one
# Until you're a professional victim
# And if you take a look you can see the cracks
# In the story told where the logic lacks
# All the pretty girls and the stupid boys
# Make the same mistakes until they've got no choice
# And once you get the stink on you

# Made spectacular claims
# And have lied in the name

# And I think I recall
# Someone brought me here
# The memory's not clear
# Just what it was
# A good love, a good love
# You define yourself by your company
# And by the promises you make
# And the ones that you keep
# Sleep the sleep of the blessed
# Dream the dreams of the whole
# Forget when you wake how far you've fallen
# Down below
# You could blow me a kiss
# If you think it brings love
# It's the faith that makes it work
# So what the hell
# Why not
# Sleep the sleep of the blessed
# Dream the dreams of the whole
# Forget when you wake

# She looked just like a train wreck
# That could've been avoided
# In a third world country
# By a long stretch of farmland
# Where the waters had run high
# And the topsoil down the river
# So that next year there would be no crops. . .
# She was as desperate as a salesman
# At a company that's folding
# But they haven't told the staff yet
# That they're bankrupt and backordered
# And they're funneling the pensions
# To the CEO's back pocket
# So in one week they'll have nothing
# I miss you girl. I hope you're fine
# Good luck, love
# Or goodbye
# She's the girl from central casting
# Always played the sweet young orphan
# Or the hooker with the heart of gold
# But she got her SAG card pulled
# And turns tricks now on Cahuenga
# She tells herself it's research
# For her next and greatest role
# I miss you girl, I hope you're fine
# Good luck, love
# Or goodbye
# She'll call you up just to hear you say she's fine
# Then she's gone away
# And you know there's only one more time
# You'll hear about her again
# Well it's life informing art informing life again
# Like every stupid kid
# That thinks that they're the first in pain
# The first to rip themselves apart
# The first to try and live without a heart
# I miss you girl, I hope you're fine
# Good luck, love
# Or goodbye
# I want to see your face, even hear your lies
# Good luck, girl
# Or goodbye
# Goodbye

# Cant believe/ that the heart of my world/
# got me on my knees/ prayin' my eyes are lyin to me/ i built
# a whole new life around you/ and in an instant we were through/
# as our future disappears/ falling like tears/ are the dreams of
# a love/ i thought we shared and
# Chorus
# It's not fair/ i was true to  you/ i finally
# settle down/ then you gone turn around/ and betray
# the trust i had in you/ it's not fair/ after all i treated you/
# respectable, with care/ said that you'd be there/ now who am i to turn to
# Man, I trusted you/ and this what I get in return/ you was like a
# brother to me/ but now is see you was just waitin your turn/ when i'd be out
# at work y'all was doin dirt/ stealin my heart away/ shared everything with
# you/ all i was goin through/ now dark skies
# and tearful eyes/ are here to stay
# CHORUS
# After all i sacrificed/ for my seed, said you'd give life/ with everything i
# am wanted for you/ to be happy, and now slowly/ the life
# of love you breathed into my heart/ is slipping away, dying today, if only/
# never thought i'd live to see/ disrespected me, how could it be/ throwin it
# away so easily.

# To keep us here believin'
# When we feel our love is slipping away
# Aren't you glad that
# Love always finds a reason
# To make us stay
# And even through the darkest night
# The feeling survives -- oh ...
# Love always finds a reason
# To keep me here believin'
# When I feel our love is slipping away
# And it seems that love always finds a reason
# To make us stay
# And even through the darkest night
# The feeling survives
# And you know when you look at me
# You'll find the reason in my eyes
# I find the reason
# I find the reason, hoh ...
# I found the reason in your eyes

# If I had to live my life without you near me
# The days would all be empty
# The nights would seem so long
# With you I see forever oh so clearly
# I might have been in love before
# But it never felt this strong
# Our dreams are young and we both know
# They'll take us where we want to go
# Hold me now, touch me now
# I don't want to live without you
# Nothing's gonna change my love for you
# You oughtta know by now
# How much I love you
# One thing you can be sure of
# I'll never ask for more than your love
# Nothing's gonna change my love for you
# You oughtta know by now
# How much I love you
# The one day changed my whole life through
# But nothing's gonna change my love for you
# If the road ahead is not so easy
# Our love will lead the way for us
# Like a guiding star
# I'll be there for you if you should need me
# You don't have to change a thing
# I love you just the way you are
# So come with me and share the view
# I'll help you see forever, too

# i stand at your gate and the song that i sing is of moonlight.
# i stand and i wait for the touch of your hand in the june night.
# the roses are sighing a moonlight serenade.
# the stars are aglow and tonight how their light sets me dreaming.
# my love, do you know that your eyes are like stars brightly beaming
# i bring you and sing you a moonlight serenade.
# let us stray till break of day
# in love's valley of dreams.
# just you and i, a summer sky,
# a heavenly breeze kissing the trees.
# so don't let me wait, come to me tenderly in the june night.
# i stand at your gate and i sing you a song in the moonlight,

# Can be like destiny

# Is like the blowing wind
# It can takes us to whenever
# Sending us on silent wings
# But I have broken
# All the rules of love
# I never dreamed that I could
# Come this far
# And now I ´m lost in my emotions
# You´re becoming my devotion
# There´s nothing I can do
# To stop this love for you
# CHORUS
# I was not supposed
# To fall in love with you
# I have someone else
# Someone else is loving you
# And I was not supposed
# To let this love get through
# So let me say for real
# Heaven´s what I feel when I´m with you
# This feeling is forever
# You make me feel like heaven
# My love is true when I´m with you
# How could I
# Have known that in your eyes
# I would find the deepest answers
# To the questions of my heart
# And how could I have known that by your side
# Was the light to fill the darkness
# In the shadows of my life
# But I have broken
# All the rules of love
# I never dreamed that I could come this far

# un amor que se adueño de mi
# desatando mis sentidos
# anhelando un corazón prohibido
# un amor que me llevó a sentir
# que a pesar de este vacio
# pueda hacerme tan feliz
# por ti yo he roto las reglas del amor
# jamás pensé perder el corazón
# y me atrapa este locura
# que me enciende, que me nubla
# nada puedo hacer para escapar de ti
# nunca imaginé poder amarte así
# tienes ortro amor y otro amor me tiene a mí
# y nunca yo soñé quererte tant así
# que culpa tengo yo
# si descubrí el amor sólo por ti
# amor que nunca muere...mi amor no muere
# contigo para siempre... es para siempre
# hoy sé vivir sólo por ti
# como hacer al corazón saber
# cuando llega el sentimiento
# si el amor ews un camino incierto
# este amor
# que siento en mí nacer
# me duelve aquel secreto
# que una vez temí perder
# por ti yo he roto las reglas del amor
# jamás pensé perder el corazón

# I'm sitting in my room
# Thinking back on you,
# Memories pass;
# My head was leaned against your face
# Partly on your shoulder, curving your neck.
# I tried to clear my thoughts of stress
# And let go of the day,
# How it began,
# Whispered your name-
# Soft white lights between us falling
# Forming into precious flowers, chartreuse
# Beautiful and floating down on us
# Sparkles flying towards us dancing all around us
# Vanish in air
# But you left before you knew
# A future holding you.
# All you saw of me-
# My heart should speak for me,
# Then you'd understand
# That push away-
# It craves compassion and
# Strong arms to hold her.
# You and me
# Revolving
# Angel wings
# Fluttering
# Orange gold
# Sunsets bold
# Star filled nights
# Sweet as Fantasia
# And still
# A glow surrounding you
# The dandelions blew
# Our wishes to the wind
# Come and bring him back again
# Soft white lights between us falling
# Forming into precious flowers, chartreuse
# Beautiful and floating down on us
# Sparkles flying towards us dancing all around us
# Vanish in air
# And I wonder how you felt
# -I was melting inside
# Opened my eyes
# -Felt so bright I was blind
# The car we hadn't left
# I closed the door
# Behind
# -And I wished you would take me away.
# You left before I waved.
# By then it was too late.
# I wished on the moon
# I'd always remember-
# You and me
# Revolving
# Angel wings
# Fluttering
# Orange gold

# And wear a naked face but why do you loathe all your friends
# Making cracks at their expense if you choose a reason

# I never thought I'd feel this way
# I never thought that I'd see a day

# Its all these demons haunting me
# Its all these little things trapped inside of me
# Releasing me from all my sin
# Its taken me all of my anger
# And taken me all of my hate
# To learn how my life came together
# Releasing the demons again
# And now I look through my minds eye
# And see where my past needs to rest
# Its always disturbed by these voices
# That echo inside of my head
# Another way that I can hide
# Another reason to crawl inside and get away
# from everything and everywhere and everyone
# NO!

# Chris Cayton I called you satan
# Cuz when we were skating
# You would make the metal sign
# You got kicked out of school for wearing profanity
# 'too drunk to fuck' said the Dead Kennedys
# on your button your punk rock button
# You were born in S.I.T.
# Vegetarian man no BLT on your muffin
# no turkey stuffing
# Once and a while I'd surf with you
# Our first band was called IMRU

# So here I go, and there you went again
# Just another stupid thing that I've done wrong
# Locked up in my head, knocked down, beaten, left for dead
# With all those brilliant things I should have said
# I've gotta get away, find something to do
# 'Cos everything I hear, everything I see reminds me of you
# Still counting the days I've been without you-- 1, 2, 3, 4
# Still counting the days that you've been gone
# Day one was no fun
# Day two, I hated you
# By day three I wished you'd come right back to me
# Day four, five, and six-- well, I guess you just don't give a shit
# Day seven... this is hell, this is hell
# Now I've gotta get away, find something to do
# But everything I hear, everything I see reminds me of you
# Still counting the days I've been without you-- 1, 2, 3, 4
# Still counting the days that you've been gone
# Still counting the days since you left me-- 1, 2, 3, 4
# Still counting the days that you've been gone
# A thousand things I want to say to you, but it's too late now
# A thousand things I want to say
# A thousand things I want to say to you, but it's too late now
# A thousand things I want to say
# Still counting the days I've been without you
# Still counting the days that you've been gone

# I know the way that I have picked apart at you

# Don't say goodbye, yeah, yeah

# And I feel so alone
# I break down and call you 'cos I'm weak
# If I can see what you are
# If I could blow away my clouded sight
# Realize you made me a fool
# If I mean nothing what else can I say
# (Chorus)
# I've lost you
# I've lost you

# Chorus:
# I can't be happy without you
# You can't be happy without me
# Still you always wanna pick a fight now
# You say it's written in the stars
# Some psychic read it in my cards
# Still you always wanna pick a fight with me
# You say that I'm the only one
# The one you're looking for
# Try and keep a straight face when you laugh
# You talk to me like I'm a saint
# But all your friends just say
# We have been so over for some time
# And I know that you had the best intentions for me
# I know that what you're saying is goodbye
# Chorus
# You say you changed your mind again
# You don't know how you feel
# Give me some more time is what you say
# You wanna use me like a toy
# That you get bored with
# Now you wanna store me far away
# And I know that you had the best intentions for me
# I know that what you're saying is goodbye
# Chorus
# I can't be happy without you
# I can't be happy without me
# Still you always wanna pick a fight with me
# I can't be happy without you
# I can't be happy without me
# Still you always wanna pick a fight with me
# You always say what you don't mean
# You always say the things that hurt me
# Why do you pick a fight with me?
# You always say what you don't mean
# You always say the things that hurt me
# Why do you pick a fight
# Why do you pick a fight
# You always pick a fight with me

# The first time that I met my mate
# Was in the roller rink where I went to skate
# It was early in the decade around '83
# Back then Maskell's was the place to be
# Pay two quid for your entry fee
# I glide into the arena, ecstasy
# When you were seven you didn't realise
# Most of the adults were stoned out of their eyes
# Some jacked up on the seats around the edge
# Others were so fcuked that they turned into veg
# I didn't care cos I made my pledge
# Rollskating at Maskell's got respect
# I used to listen to Public Enemy
# Erik B and Rakim and BVSMP
# But before that, in 1983
# I'd go breakdancing after my tea
# Down the youth club, eating the fruit pastels
# Saturday morning I'd go down to Maskell's
# It was my favourite place to go
# Dancing all day at the Rollerdisco
# ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-nineteen eighty three
# When Maskells is over it's out on your bike
# Doing bunny hops and wheelies if you like

# A Blim-burn burned right down to my d***,
# And while I was distracted, I f***ing crashed into a

# The bonnet flipped up and the windscreen shattered,
# YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re better off smoking The Green instead,
# Cause it donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Blim-Burn and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better for your head.
# Soap Bar! Sitting in a deep sweat,

# You can use those as a quality guide,
# Of the standard of Soap Bar that you are smoking,
# The more bits of plastic means the better the toking.
# Eat a Hash-cake but wait a while,
# ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take about an hour ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Draw versatile,
# You can burn it, eat it, or smoke it in a spliff,
# Space shakes, Draw gateauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, you knows it Delia Smith,
# Lying in your bed dropping blimps on your pubes,
# Selling Draw to your mates but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really Oxo cubes,
# When youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re cooking up draw, be quick donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lick it,
# Cause itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really f***ing hot and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll burn your fingers.

# IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll smoke Soap Bar Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtill I f***ing die,
# Before I die and they lay me to rest,
# I will always smoke Soap Bar, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the best.
# Well anyway I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better myself to lean forwards,
# When smoking Soap Bar, because you are less likely to Blim-Burn,
# You know what I mean?
# Innit, check it out man! I got some quality f***ing Gold-Seal for you, innit?
# Shape up all those little bits of plastic what you find inside, right,
# And then f***ing stick them in a teapot,
# Makes a lovely cup of tea, that does.
# What I do, stick a f** in the microwave, right,
# You toke it up, you sticks the Draw on top,
# And you rams it in a bong and you rams the bong in your f***ing head.
# Yeah thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like my f***ing lungs feel like,
# TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re f***ing collapsing sometimes from the Soap Bar like,

# And nothing left of what we were at all...
# So here I am
# Pacing around this house again
# With pictures of us living
# On these walls
# I see my breath in the cold of the air that I breathe and I'm wondering
# I'm wondering if it's you that I feel
# If it's you that I feel here haunting me forever

# how ready are you to die for an ideal what's the connection between a lie and what is real mother superior i've got an angel on my back i'm one of the righteous and i'm never going back no, no, no i'm never going back who's that shining forth-right man about to die behind me he's waiting for the portress to send me head over heels who's that black-heart four-star general walking up the hill to ask the liberals nicely to help finance his private war and if i didn't trust that man when he puts the rifle in your hand sings you songs of pageantry and grace and how much you want to bet on the other side there's a man with twice your pride and they put you feet first in an unmarked grave there was a time in our history when we justified by saying our destinies manifest now imperialism is the man trial of the west see that trigger happy college boys love a chance to try out their new toys then they wash the city streets clean with the blood of infidels as the fabric of democracy left tattered in the dust we could put, another greedy man into the, dictatorial, puppet-show, now tell me who do you trust who do you trust and an abominable hemisphere would perpetuate a heart-whole atmosphere call it a threat to national security call it just a poor-sick face one more place to export cheap labor hail the monarchy hail the oligarchy a potential for anarchy and we pat ourselves firmly on the back

# Sometimes it seems so tough
# Good friends are not enough
# And I'm powerless to help
# When you take it all upon yourself
# Feels like you just can't win
# The whole wide world is closing in
# And it's so hard not to think the worse
# When you're the centre of the universe
# I see you struggling with the weight of the world
# Remember I'm always by your side
# Too many problems for one little girl
# I'll be beside you when all your tears have dried
# I lay next to you at night
# I know something's just not right
# But there's nothing I can say
# When you feel ten thousand miles away
# I don't have all the answers yet
# But I get scared when you're upset
# And your heart feels like an empty home
# When you feel so scared and all alone
# Think everybody's talking about you
# And conspiring to bring you down
# You're thinking that nobody loves you
# Ever wonder why I'm still around

# when it's time to start working to reconstruct a life programmed to self-destruct when it's time to set your sights on something better when all that you've known is the emptiness of being alone when friends start drifting away sometimes it's better to let go it only hurts to hold on to time worn memories sometimes it's never what is seems it only serves to break your will i had a dream last night that you and i got in a fight i never meant to hurt you but i guess it ended up that way we went our seperate ways and i stayed mad for six whole days that's when i realized when i'm alone i'm in bad company i want to help you but you've got to want to help yourself i don't want to bury another friend i take it day by day and watch the people i love just fade away where's the good in this? whatever happened to you?

# like a weathered statue i will wait for you like the darkness fading waiting to see it through like an ardent cry wakes me from the silence of my sleep like a distant bell like a man who fights the system fights to keep if you have to ask the price you can't afford it there's nothing free in this world there's nothing free in this life like a super hero i'll try to save the world with an anesthetic to life a thousand fingers like a man accused i'll weigh the consequence like a man afraid of the madness just beyond the picket fence

# Now TLC will challenge Goodie Mob
# To a game of ghetto laser tag
# When they say 'What it is'
# You scream 'What it ain't'
# [Left Eye] (Big Gipp)
# (Battle zone, Goodie)
# 1999 (Yeah)
# TLC, M-O-B (And Goodie Mob)
# The synergy of ghetto sounds for the Y-2-G
# (What'cha wanna do with it?)
# What it is, what it ain't
# (What?)
# Either you bring it
# (We gon' bring it)
# Or you can't
# Sometimes it gets kind of messy out there
# (Sometimes)
# But we get by
# (Well what'cha wanna do with it)
# One day at a time
# Stuck on me at waffle house
# After 1:12, when I go out
# Where do you hang?
# Or do you slang?
# Or wear a chain?
# Wear platinum rings?
# I still maintain my ghetto siren
# Keep my pride
# Get in my ride
# Twenty-inch rims
# I sport a brim
# And when my girls
# Go to the mall
# Around the world
# And keep the change
# The finest things
# We still remain so ooh
# You don't even look from across the room
# You don't know enough about this world to
# Ever get it on with me
# Or hang out where I do
# You don't even look from across the floor
# You don't have game enough any more
# Come up on a girl like me
# And that's not a possibility cause
# You big plastic girl
# I'mma big boss man
# I like old model cars and big sedans
# You like two doors
# Frontin' their clothes and Rolls
# Or sit on the porch sip something real cold
# I like the nine when you up and not O's
# I do suits while you prefer the lows
# Tonight I'mma choose cause you already chose
# Grown for the business and I run to flow
# Cause you ain't ghetto enough for me
# And you ain't hot enough for me
# And you ain't fly enough for me
# And you're too tight with your money
# Cause you ain't ghetto enough for me
# And you ain't hot enough for me
# And you ain't fly enough for me
# And you're too tight with your money
# Check it baby
# So ghetto like hot fries
# I come from Melvin and resemble
# Twenty-twenty with his blood shot eyes, got 32 loads
# Went from two O's to 32 loads
# Which is enough to buy a Roll
# But nobody knows
# Stay in my place
# Keep my diamonds out of your face
# You wanna be with this player
# You got play at my pace
# I'm slow but I can still come over there from where you're from
# If you want some bullshit you better buy you some
# You don't even look from across the room
# You don't know enough about this world to
# Ever get it on with me
# Or hang out where I do
# You don't even look from across the floor
# You don't have game enough any more
# Come up on a girl like me
# And that's not a possibility cause
# Shorty with your booty showin'
# Shorty with your gold teeth
# Shorty with your long nails
# Shorty with your fake hair
# Shorty got the attitude all up in the news
# To represent the Nineties girl
# Doing it oh I need to
# I got the back you got the front
# That's how we do up in the woods
# With the bump on the log, ain't no scrubs over here
# I'mma ghetto millionaire, can you see me in the clear?
# I'mma keep on serving 'em like I'm supposed to baby
# Cause you ain't ghetto enough for me

# Killing people one by one Only talking with their guns
# They put them in iron chains All young mothers sold as slaves
# Babies brying through their mouth Will they ever see the light
# Cold and dreams are in Eldorado
# I have drowned in seas of red and black
# Gold and dreams are in Eldorado
# May come true but only in your heart
# Shout and your hands will be free And he shall live in liberty
# Oh will mankind ever learn Shall they hold to iron burn
# In the history of man The search for happiness has never ended
# But if the gates of eden were ever closed
# Those conquistdors who are only hungry for gold
# Because the real Eldorado isn't made of diamond or gold
# But by peace and understanding The hearts of everyone

# Long time ago, when I was a young boy
# I saw that movie "Mutiny on the Bounty"
# Starring my idol, Marlon Brando
# And I felt a yearning for that great adventure
# So many nights I woke up out of a dream
# A dream of blue seas, white sands,
# Paradise birds, butterflies and beautiful warm-hearted girls
# Sun of Jamaica, the dream of Malaika
# Your love is my sweet memory
# Sun of Jamaica, Blue Lady Malaika
# Some day I'll return, wait and see
# Walk in the sand and l'm happy with you
# We shall be loving and true
# Oh I sure love Malaika
# With all of my heart
# I will always be faithful and true, yeah true
# But now as I grew older
# The buring desire became so strong
# That I bought a ticket to fly home
# And then I found you
# And we found an eternal love right from the beginning
# The stars falling down from the lagoon of gold
# The palms swaying under the moon
# We were swimming out into the crystal sea
# In that fateful night I thought to myself
# I'll do everything I can, save every dime
# And one day I'll return
# And then I'll stay forever, forever
# Sun of Jamaica, the dream of Malaika
# Your love is my sweet memory
# Sun of Jamaica, Blue Lady Malaika
# Some day I'll return, wait and see
# Walk in the sand and l'm happy with you
# We shall be loving and true
# Oh I sure love Malaika

# In demon days, it's cold inside
# You don't get nobody, people sigh
# It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself
# Hiding in a hole in there
# All the glasses are too big
# Bring it back, got to hold it back
# To let you do that yet you don't want me back
# Before it fall down, falling down falling down
# Falling out to go far from the soul (ah)
# Well these demon days are so cold inside
# It's so hard to live, and so to survive
# You can't even trust the air you breathe
# Cause Mother Earth has a soul to leave
# When lies become reality
# You love yourself because it's easy
# Pick yourself up it's a brand new day
# So turn yourself round
# Don't burn yourself, turn yourself
# Turn yourself around to the soul

# Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain,
# there was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived,
# their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world,
# obscured as it was by great clouds.
# Here they played out their peaceful lives,
# innocent of the litany of excess and violence that was growing in the world below.
# To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough.
# Then one day Strangefolk arrived in the town.
# They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses, but no one noticed them: they only saw shadows.
# You see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind.
# Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
# Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
# Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
# Now everybody dancing the dance of the dead,
# the dance of the dead,
# the dance of the dead
# In time, Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain,
# and it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable Sincerity and Beauty.
# By chance, they stumbled upon the Place Where All Good Souls Come to Rest.
# The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things,
# and soon they began to mine the mountain, its rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world.
# Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly,
# their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls.
# Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain.
# Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
# And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain,
# holes began to appear, bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the monkey.
# For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful for they knew that soon the Monkey would soon stir from its deep sleep.
# And then came a sound. Distant first, it grew into castrophany so immense it could be heard far away in space.
# There were no screams. There was no time.
# The mountain called Monkey had spoken.
# There was only fire.
# And then, nothing.
# O little town in U.S.A, your time has come to see
# There's nothing you believe you want
# But where were you when it all came down on me?
# Did you call me now?

# I run through your veins like James & The Famous Flames
# Name is Grand Agent, this is how you play the game
# Lay up in the cut like the babies in your nuts
# Even though you wanna make it born, never rush
# Treat it like a trick and cover up your dick and
# feel what you spit and you might write a hit and
# maybe you won't, but I still think you dope
# Not the type to hope that a brother drop the soap
# like the kid up in Half Baked, check the second Quest tape
# "It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool."
# But worse though it's ignorant, not to make niggas rich
# Even Chuck D sell his stuff on the internet
# Now you wanna get outta ya deal (Fuck you talkin bout?)
# Don't let this rhyme change how the way you feel
# Naaah, don't be mad cuz it ain't all good
# Believin everything that you saw in the hood
# It goes on and on into show-biz
# with the dumb shit, on some "Yo where you from kid?"
# Now you represent that, though it's evident that
# you talkin bout places that you ain't never been at
# In fact, I'ma say it again
# Livin by the pen is minglin with mayhem - c'mon
# [Chorus: various samples - repeat 2X]

# See I write my own rhymes, produce my own hits
# and I'm never at a loss for new shit
# I take a whole song and rape it
# with so much finesse though, brothers can't hate it
# And if they do then so what it's all love
# What I'm about to say should be dug
# Rap is my bitch and your bitch is my bitch and
# some of y'all is rich, but your rhymes ain't shit
# So how do you frauds like me now?
# I only hit grand slams, never will I foul
# Brothers pop fly when they be catchin deals
# I step to your crew cuz I know they think for you
# Yo, you can't hustle down this way
# "Aiyyo Grand, I heard you moved to LA!"
# You gotta know folks, a whole lotta folks
# but if they whack, then it don't mean jack man
# You better off on your own ock
# Doin this for the love of Hip Hop
# I gotta thousand rhymes books at the crib
# not for show though, it's just the way I live
# See, me I want the show doe, some get no dough
# It's up to you though, choose your own path bro
# But remember when you live by the pen
# Yo kid, you're minglin with mayhem
# [Grand Agent]
# Yo, it's deadlier than being truthful
# Sometimes when you that and you black then they shoot you
# But the norm it's not, if you perform a lot
# make sure it's not warm, but hot
# In other words, earn your stardom
# Never follow something other than your own calling
# Rough and rugged, not for the timid
# Inside the North Blunt Illadel city limits
# learned from the greats so the flakes and fakes
# gotta hold tight, yeah they just gotta wait
# I'm not speakin to upset ya, I bet the lecture
# .. will enhance your whole two-bit
# education on this rap shit, you got it ass backwards
# Gotta speak truth irregardless of the facts kid
# Word - but if preferred, you can be a bitch
# To get a deal you be a eight-to-one pick
# It's in the handle, can you handle your pen?
# Yo, you're minglin with mayhem

# Met the nigga bitch cruisin in the white bitch car
# told her give ya pussy to me, you'll be a big star
# And I try to be a man of my word so what I did

# Invited forty niggas to the spot no doubt
# and broadcast the VHS of me bussin it out
# Niggas all on the dick for like a good two weeks
# tryin to know how a broke nigga keep two freaks
# I met the white bitch at this open mic cafÃ©
# When I was done spillin my spill, she walked my way
# and said the poetry was like Spanish fly in her drink
# I could tell before dawn I would be in the pink
# So it was just formality we chit chat for a while
# On the way to her rest, I stop off for Lifestyles
# She was bent totally, so I pushed the Ac' gunnin it
# She passed out, that's when I met the black one and shit
# [Grand Agent]
# It's a uh, what.
# And listen up, one paid and one dead broke
# One scared of the dick, the other live for the deep throat
# One dropped out and one went to college
# But they both wanna be the only one, do the knowledge
# No bitch can be everything to a king
# The bitch who recognize that, she get promoted to queen
# Otherwise, they'll keep wonderin why
# to them my dick is lightnin and thunder, it rain when they cry
# mad tears of joy and pain for the b-boy Christ
# who fell to temptation when I brought the bliss to they life
# Yeah they hate to see me go even though I came to cum
# It's not about the sex or the pain that I brung
# We be buildin relations in between the ep's
# exchangin our philosophies, gettin further in depth
# But God forbid deeper than my dick go
# Just enough to keep 'em happy like a faggot in Frisco

# Ohhhhhhhhahhhhhh
# End to end, end to end
# Experience, experience, a new sensation
# Some of this is factual, most of it ain't a lie
# Two days before autumn, fifty-two after July
# The sun shone bright, on time was her flight
# Shot to LAX absolute, positive like
# Only the shit-brown '82 Corrola could
# Drive up inside arrivals, guess who lookin good
# like five-six, archive thick, broad hips
# I downshift and coast to the curb like word
# She cheesin up while I easin up, double park
# Throw the blinkers on, jump out, God bless her heart
# Lookin like a tourist with the duffel and camera
# Throw the bags in the back, we embrace then I slam the hatch
# Right back where we left off
# When we built for three weeks but then I stepped off
# It just so happened, we met like ships passin
# Rappin, no actual action
# Now here she was live, all the way from back home
# Bodily counterpart to the voice over the phone
# I spoke to for strong minutes, long distance
# Even wrote a note with a quote of song in it
# The bus thrust me sixty East of L.A.
# The length to which I went to find words to say
# 3K, took me three days to get here
# It took her six hours - that equal twenty-three years
# Love won't let me wait a minute more
# There's a bomb to the left of my passenger door
# with a hundred-twenty hours to diffuse it or lose it
# Got to need to relate to this queen like music
# Or else, else or go from wealth to poor
# Never that, take the prize and floor it to the shore
# No small talk, give me a medium speech
# We fitta slit the wrist the of time on Manhattan Beach
# [Chorus: same unknown singer]
# Love is like water, flowin
# flowin every which way
# When you think it's flown one direction, it done
# it done flown the other way
# [Grand Agent]
# Said the flight was peace, said she happy to see me
# Said she wanna check her aunt in the valley of Simi
# Can't believe that she here, told I couldn't either
# Right hand volleyin, gearshift receiver
# Cause I play it by ear and she habitually plans
# Twenty minutes we was parked fifty feet from the sand
# Laid our troubles, down like bodies on the quilt
# on the strand on September 21st and we built
# Anatomical ebonics was the language
# Speakin much silence cause we both thinkin bout the same shit
# How we found ourselves back together
# by a bond that was based solely on fair weather
# Truth be told, we ain't even know each other
# Tryin to prove that we did gave us somethin to show each other
# And it can never be chumped again
# We left the beach and jetted East towards the Comfort Inn
# Sixty-two minute transit through Southern Cali
# The hotel was near the rest in Moreno Valley
# where I was stayin with a friend of the fam
# who had made no concessions for a friend of the Grand
# Agent at the front desk who checked us in
# was Filipino, the housekeeper was Mexican
# And, 217 was the room that she cleaned
# After me and this queen has said and did everything
# We traded baths, body massages, laughs
# Future aspirations and accounts of the past
# Quality time, probably rhyme material
# The last breakfast: donuts, Tang, cereal
# 'Twas continental and the trip monumental
# Did a gang of things coulda swore I wasn't into
# But the swearin was impairin my ability
# to give and receive love, plus humility
# Love is like water, flowin
# flowin every which way
# When you think it's flown one direction, it done
# it done flown the other way
# Love is like water, flowin
# flowin every which way..
# [Grand Agent]
# Than real time, I was movin faster
# On a stage, with no Ceremony to Master
# But then saw the lights like the rest of my life
# Just mics, no whores, imagine wives on tours
# wit Momsug, Like yo, "How would you rather...?"
# The cockiness to pop quiz Wiz didn't gather
# Well not before she left anyway
# But I feel like I can spill and reveal it any day
# And never be too soon or too late
# These thoughts and others, they run through me at the gate
# while, she checkin bags bout to make her trip round
# Back to a world minus me she was bound
# And I was left behind to write this rhyme
# It took time cause she bounced with a piece of my mind
# Yeah, disappear she did, my new cohort
# I was back on my solo and the whole airport
# it felt vacant, I'm just another face in the pool
# Now that my reflection is no more visible
# Back to my MCI empty identity
# I wrote before she bounced even like, "Remember me!"
# Yeah whateva ya do, darlin do
# Cause whateva ya did took me outta what I'm all into
# Even had me second guessin my profession
# Her presence like a lesson that inspired such questions
# What the fuck am I still rhymin for?
# If I ain't blow yet, I must got bad timin or
# it ain't for me, could that possibly be?
# I even lost a battle to a lesser MC
# Being the fresher MC, I got my little pride hurt
# for holdin the mic, like the body inside of the skirt
# And practically gave the title away
# Cause in a spell I would have to say, "L.A. farewell"

# Watching the cars go rolling by
# My friends are gone
# I've got nothing to do
# So I sit here patiently
# Watching the clock tick so slowly
# Gotta get away
# Or my brains will explode
# Give me something to do to kill some time
# Take me to that place that I call home
# Take away the strains of being lonely
# Take me to the tracks at Christie Road
# See the hills from afar
# Standing on my beat up car
# The sun went down and the night fills the sky
# Now I feel like me once again
# As the train comes rolling in
# Smoked my boredom gone
# Slapped my brains up so high
# Mother stay out of my way of that place we go
# We'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road
# If there's one thing that I need that makes me feel complete
# So I go to Christie Road

# [Part 1]
# I'm the son of rage and love
# The Jesus of Suburbia
# From the bible of none of the above
# On a steady diet of soda pop and Ritalin
# No one ever died for my sins in hell
# As far as I can tell
# At least the ones I got away with
# And there's nothing wrong with me
# This is how I'm supposed to be
# In a land of make believe
# That don't believe in me
# Get my television fix sitting on my crucifix
# The living room or my private womb
# While the moms and brads are away
# To fall in love and fall in debt
# To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane
# To keep me insane and doing someone else's cocaine
# And there's nothing wrong with me
# This is how I'm supposed to be
# In a land of make believe
# That don't believe in me
# [Part 2: City Of The Damned]
# At the center of the Earth
# In the parking lot
# Of the 7-11 where I was taught
# The motto was just a lie
# It says home is where your heart is
# But what a shame
# Cause everyone's heart
# Doesn't beat the same
# It's beating out of time
# City of the dead
# At the end of another lost highway
# Signs misleading to nowhere
# City of the damned
# Lost children with dirty faces today
# No one really seems to care
# I read the graffiti
# In the bathroom stall
# Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
# And so it seemed to confess
# It didn't say much
# But it only confirmed that
# The center of the earth
# Is the end of the world
# And I could really care less
# City of the dead
# At the end of another lost highway
# Signs misleading to nowhere
# City of the damned
# Lost children with dirty faces today

# I don't care if you don't
# I don't care if you don't care

# Everyone is so full of shit
# Born and raised by hypocrites
# Hearts recycled but never saved

# I can't remember a word that you were saying
# Are we demented or am I disturbed?

# Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed
# Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
# For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse

# This town that don't exist
# So I run
# I run away
# To the light of masochist
# And I leave behind

# She sings to the moon and the stars in the sky
# Shining from high above you shouldn't ask why
# She is the one that you'll never forget
# She is the heaven sent angel you met
# Oh she must be the reason why god made a girl
# She is so pretty all over the world
# She puts the rythm, the beat in the drum
# She comes in the morning, in the evening she's gone
# Every little hour, every second you live
# Trust in eternity, that's what she gives
# She looks like Marilyn, walks like Susanne
# She talks like Monica and Mary-Ann
# She wins in everything that she might do
# And she will respect you, forever just you
# She is the one that you'll never forget
# She is the heaven sent angel you met
# Oh she must be the reason why god made a girl
# She is so pretty all over the world
# She is so pretty all over the world
# She is so pretty
# She is like you and me, like them, like we
# She's in you and me
# She is the one that you'll never forget
# She is the heaven sent angel you met
# Oh she must be the reason why god made a girl
# She is so pretty all over the world

# (Chorus):
# You were My First, my last, and my only
# Ever since you left I've been lonely
# I can't find no love in my homies
# Yooouuu allwayys was true (2X)
# I knew it, ever since I started see'in ya
# A few body scars, a few misdemeanors
# You was down when nobody else was down
# Helped me stacked the pounds, kept the gat in ya blouse
# I admit I used to fuck around a little bit
# But I knew that you would always be my chick
# You be my shit talk, and next she be in black and blue
# It was true I always had to have you
# I can still smell the curry shrimp and rice
# You'se the only one I ever trusted with my life, shit
# I'd like to break up, to make-up, to make love
# Them was some of the best times that we ever was
# Chorus - 2X
# I remember them bitches they tried to hit your sister
# Both look at you and got their ass shook up
# You was crazy, I was crazier for being with you
# Everybody said I shouldn't, I didn't listen
# Stealing me outfits for birthdays and holidays
# Snatchin shit up with your purse, up at Robinson-Mays
# Cleanin the shells at Victoria Secret
# Going diamond lovey, and sell it on weekends
# You used to say never give the dick away
# And if I did me and that bitch just disappear away
# Brown Traps I love you like a brother
# Everytime when she tired she reminds me of her
# My mother, my brother I love'em to the death
# No matter what they say I wouldn't love you any less
# Uhh, Uhh, Uhh, Uhh, no matter what they say I wouldn't love you any less

# A day M. Felicish Orlean rest in peace
# Part of my heart's gold
# It was me and you against the world baby but we helped our own
# Some times they went wrong some times they went right
# It was the petty shit the reason we fuss and fight
# We was closer, than the coast of Nosetrub
# Everybody thought they didn't know us
# I knew that you was be having my baby
# I was scared he be broke, he grow up the same way
# If it was up to me you wouldn't have to work for shit
# We can live great on the states and live mad rich
# I guess God need the soldiers in heaven
# Soldier you was and soldier forever, and ever
# Chorus - 2X
# Uh, uh come on baby

# I remember when I met you on Crenshaw
# I almost crashed my truck, and spilled my Hen' dawg
# Yes you, God blessed you, I was trying to get next to you
# Your homegirls was hating, but I didn't care
# You said you had a man, I was like 'where?'
# It was something so different about you
# I felt so gifted around you
# Even though you had a man and all
# I took the chance to call, we held hands at the mall
# That day was so special to me
# Your man left you at Mickey D's
# You called me, I scooped you up
# I seen fear in your eyes, the tears in your eyes
# He can't hug you like I hug you
# Better yet love you like this thug do
# [Chorus - Mario Winans]
# You're so special, you're the one
# But you're already ta-ken
# Oh I can't help the way I'm feeling
# You're the one, I wish I could replace him
# Cause I know that baby you're the one
# [Verse - Guerilla Black]
# I'm having the time of my life
# Felt the world on wheels, you and your homegirl got some skills
# Nobody make me feel like you do
# Or better yet real like you, I messed around and killed dude
# I seen homegirly just flossin, we made eye contact
# Dude always is flossin, me never
# You and B-l-a-c-k forever, tattered on my neck in green letters
# Late night eating H䡧en-Dazs, watching Uncut
# And me sitting there, playing wit your butt
# Took off your clothes, I hit it on the counch
# Even though mom's in the house
# Nothing could replace this feeling
# It's like winning 2 million, our bond closer than Cicilians
# I know old boy won't leave you alone
# I know you love him, but our love is strong
# [Verse - Guerilla Black]
# I couldn't leave well enough alone
# Hell I had to hit ya cell phone
# I left you a message, it went like this, 'I love you, mmmuah!'
# I guess it's my luck, I goes to the Magic
# Damn, ain't that his truck?
# I guess you wit him, screw him
# If it wasn't for you, I'd have to do him
# You seen 'em at Jack In The Box
# He was mackin a lot, to some rats in a drop
# Now you call The Beat and The Power, dedicate songs every hour
# All hell done broke loose
# He got your passcode to your cell and my Nextel shirt too
# I guess it's time for you to decide
# Which one of us you want in your ride?

# Can you find the missing link
# Your only validation is living your own life
# Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time

# Yeah I'll find a way to cure the pain
# If I said that you're my friend
# And our love would never end
# How long before I had your trust again
# I opened up the doors when it was cold outside
# Hopin' that you'd find your own way in
# But how can I protect you
# Or try not to neglect you
# When you won't take the love I have to give
# I bought me an illusion
# An I put it on the wall
# I let it fill my head with dreams
# And I had to have them all
# But oh the taste is never so sweet
# As what you'd believe it is-
# Well I guess it never is
# It's these prejudiced illusions
# That pump the blood
# To the heart of the biz
# You know I never thought

# You know I never knew how to be strong

# But I feel as though you raped me
# 'Cause you climbed inside my world
# And in my songs
# So now I've closed the door
# To keep the cold outside
# Seems somehow I've found the will to live
# But how can I forget you
# Or try not to reject you
# When we both know it takes time to forgive
# Sweetness is a virtue
# And you lost your virtue long ago
# You know I'd like to hurt you

# You's gettin' too big for your pants

# Cut out while you can
# You can use you illusion-
# Let it take you where it may

# And then sometimes it's best to walk away
# Me I'm just here hangin' on
# It's my only place to stay at least
# For now anyway
# I've worked too hard for my illusions
# Just to throw them all away
# I'm taking time for quiet consolation
# In passing by this love that's passed away
# I know it's never easy-
# So why should you believe me
# When I've always got so many things to say
# Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made
# 'Cause playful hearts
# Can sometimes be enraged
# You know I tried to wake you-

# And it's one towards me you've seldom shown
# So I'll say it for good measure

# It's pure perfection when we kiss and
# You're my Mr., I'm your Miss
# Gonna be until we're old
# This kind of love is getting expensive

# Cha-ching, cha-ching, we got hydroponic love and we're smokin'
# Cha-ching, cha-ching, we burn it, you and I, we are so lit
# And we're so rich in love, we're rollin' in cashmere
# Got it in fifth gear, baby

# Yo, My morning showers like a rebirth; reflections of the womb
# Crazy sentimental floatin' in lukewarm placental
# Now I chop a burden on the sink trying not to think about what
# Lies before me but the sun just reassured me that
# Everythings gonna be allright, the last thing on my mind is tonight
# Its like a sintch and getting Zestfully clean not to mention
# Scrub my ass and armpits for a bit and then I split over to the mirror
# Wipe the dew to make my vision clearer
# Then I moisturize my face with some aloe Vera
# This is that type of day cause I can feel it that
# You ain't letting bad vibes invade your spirit
# Anyway it's time to get the breath right
# So I grab the Crest and toothbrush, circular motions to the left, right
# Just enough to see the teeth sparkle a bit
# I fill my grill with Listerine and then it's gargle, gargle, spit
# And now that's good hygiene, you know what I mean?
# And my mouths the definition of so fresh and so clean (clean)
# I feel it's only right, since my words all I got
# And nobody wants to listen when your breath is hot
# But that's a story in itself so I head to my bedroom
# Throw on some drawers and pick out a costume
# I think ill rock these blue jeans and this tee shirt
# And whats a little polo sport gonna hurt?
# C'mon
# This is that day cause I can feel it
# You know the type of day you ain't lettin' bad vibes invade your spirit
# As the birds chirp your favorite tune
# It's like I'm right back in my momma's womb
# Cause everything is so serine
# And the temperature is just right
# Not a worry in sight
# And plus the sun is shining bright, it's a beautiful day
# It's a beautiful day
# Shall I continue where I left off?
# I'm feelin' kinda lovely but my
# Tummy is growlin' so I'm feeling kinda hungry
# So I hit the kitchen and I'm wishin' there's some food in sight
# What do ya know? I got that Cinnamon Life
# And now I'm real happy, fill my salad bowl up with cereal
# To my surprise it's Jackson Five up on the stereo
# I turn it up my words can't describe my reaction to
# Wakin' up and listening to prepubescent Michael Jackson
# Open up the Frigidair what do we have here?
# Seems like just enough milk to fill my morning craving
# Peep out the window just to see if Izzy is misbehaving
# He's staring at me with a grin like 'Yo, let me in man!'
# So I begin to fill his dish with Kibbles N' Bits
# Let him in so he can eat, and I'm eating my sh**
# So now we both full and well fed
# Happier than that fat rat Templeton from Charlotte's Web
# And now its time to get our walk on
# Izzy can get his bark on
# It's a beautiful day maybe we'll get our state park on
# I know the lake is at its finest (you better take afvantage)
# I'll grab my backpack, this leash, and maybe make a sandwich
# I better grab my ghetto blaster and a few tapes,
# A thurmos full of water and a bag of fresh grapes
# Some more tapes cause you know that music comes first
# And what's a little Jackson Five gonna hurt?
# C'mon
# This is that day cause I can feel it
# You know the type of day you ain't lettin' bad vibes invade your spirit
# As the birds chirp your favorite tune
# It's like I'm right back in my momma's womb

# It seems like lately time be beatin' my ass,
# Every step is like a right hook from Iron Mike Tyson in his prime,
# It's like my mind is on a tredmill,
# I'm sweatin' bullets,
# see the plug but I can't pull it,
# This belt just keeps bringin' me back,
# And every minute is like a 'tiger uppercut' from Sagat,
# I'm up against these ropes,
# and ain't no tellin' if I win or not,
# These gloves are getting heavy,
# it's fight or flight you know how that goes,
# Facin' clocks is chasin',
# got me dodgin' obstacles,
# And every hour is like a tightrope I walk with greasy shoes,
# Still yet I got my conscience tellin' me that I can't lose,
# So every time I start slippin' ego's start trippin',
# I focus real hard and levitate just like I'm GOD,
# And I'm livin' lovely,
# I'm in the clouds no one above me,
# With the gift to differentiate snakes from those that love me,
# There's a thin line between happiness and hopeless,
# An even thinner line between on point and out of focus,
# BUT Back to my story about my fall from glory,
# And how I levitate from the fate time put before me,
# They say 'Be patient',
# but what the f*** is patience when my heart is racin'?
# Put yourself in my situation,
# Try to be humble,
# you won't refrain from getting' pi**ed,
# When you look down to see you're fallin' right through time's abyss,
# And start to see visions,
# memories you really miss, simple things,
# Like your first birthday wish,
# Your first girlfriend,
# Your first love,
# Your first French kiss,
# Your first time feeling hate,
# The first time you got dissed,
# Your first day of school,
# Your very first college class,
# Your first time touchin' t******,
# First time you got ass,
# Your first time learnin' wrong from right,
# First lonely night,
# The first time you got your ass whooped in
# Your first real fight,
# Your first triple-double dare,
# Your first pubic hair,
# Your first time watchin' Jason,
# Your first nightmare,
# That's when you realize that time was your worst nightmare,
# And now you're stuck asking yourself 'Why ain't life fair?',
# You get closer to the bottom,
# see the end of your line,
# Your first time ever losin' this battle with time,
# But right before you meet your death,
# one more memory left,
# The only one that's obsolete was your first breath,
# One moon to the next,
# Clocks switch when you least expect it and make the simplest sh** complex,
# The baby face got the planet fooled,
# Books get judged by the covers worldwide, coincide with the illest,
# The real is just fictional dreams,
# No time to deal with two dimensional fiends, sh** hit's the fan with every click of a hand,
# I'll be a man eventually,
# When the kid in me is satisfied, but 'til the day arrives all I got is eighty-five.
# A clock can kill motivation,
# that's why I'm never rockin' a watch,
# What's a deadline when you're living on your own time?
# I'm livin' slow, Peter Pan style son,
# You didn't know I never grow up,
# my mind is set at six years old,
# As far as I'm concerned this grown-up sh** is for the birds,
# So pass the skittles,
# JuJu Fruits, the Now N Laters, and Nerds,
# I'm eatin' sweets until my teeth fall out and I can't see
# And I'm deaf in my left ear but my right can hear cause
# I'm livin' happily. So why you mad at me?
# Cause your frustrations gave you grey hairs,
# 99% of your life's spent chasin'
# American nightmares, (GET THE f*** OUT OF HERE)
# I'm crazy childish, just check the habits,
# I play with my food, pick my nose, and eat it damn it,
# Plus I pick my scabs, I be the first to pop a blister,
# Cause I'm more immature than that cat from Sister-Sister,
# If my parents tell me no I'm gonna do it anyway,
# Experience will make more sense than anything that they could ever say,
# Forever playin' video games until I'm sleepy,
# Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, please,
# you'll never beat me,
# So basically you're better off paying a bill or somethin',
# Your mind is elderly, forty over the hill or somethin',

# you ever seen the movie big?
# My heart is trapped in '85 the coolest place I've ever been in my life,
# We watchin' Smurfs, eatin' cinnamon LIFE,
# Never knew a crack rock, cause it was Fraggle,

# You think you know, but you have no idea
# This is the diary of a breathing onomanopia
# Now here's another broken link for anyone who thinks my life's together
# I rock a raincoat despite the pleasant weather
# God's placed a permanent dark cloud above my head
# But he was nice enough to loan me a holy umbrella
# Well thank ya fella,
# How considerate
# I'm the illegitimate son of accident-prone degenerates
# Today's forecast partly cloudy with a good chance of rain
# So I wear my sarcasm badge proudly and
# Flash a devilish grin
# That'll make the most masculine Men skeptical of his existence
# And when the rain begins, I take a seat to retire and admire the spectacle
# From a distance
# For instance, there was this cat the other day shootin me ice grills
# But when I looked, he looked the other way
# Now any other day
# Wouldn't let this type of sh** bother me
# Today it was enough to make my lucky charms soggy
# So finally I stepped to him
# Kindly disrespected him
# Looked him dead in the eyes and analyzed how it effected him
# He broke down in tears talkin bout how Jesus neglected him
# Make this rain go away
# Things would be much better
# I swear, I swear
# If the sun would come out today
# Life would be more worthwhile, worthwhile,
# And all it took was a sewing needle to deflate my swollen ego
# Then pop pop went my God Complex
# I never thought 19 yrs after my first breath I'd be in art school surrounded
# By corny f***s debating who's more depressed
# I'm 21 now, and still can't deal with what's real
# But I'll be damned if I give up and settles for pills
# Daddy taught me better
# Mommy taught me how to crack 40's and jack 6 packs in oversized sweaters
# And one time my mother changes
# So I'm in the rain waiting
# For the flood gates to open
# Impersonating my favorite VH1 Behind the Music tragedy
# Catastrophe never tasted so acidic before
# I'm PH balanced
# For the floor? But strong enough to stay a float
# And doggy paddle long enough to catch that
# Life preserver rope
# And then I'll be on a parallel ladder laughin like,
# Damn my man, for the love of Pete what happened
# And finally I step to you
# Kindly disrespect you
# Looked you dead in the eyes and analyzed how it affected you
# Watch you break down in tears talkin bout how J
# Esus neglected you
# Misdirected the definition of pitiful
# Make this rain go away
# Things would be much better
# I swear, I swear
# If the sun would come out today
# Life would be more worthwhile, worthwhile,
# Yo, you ever watch a whole day wash away like your
# Very last match that got wet the second you struck it
# Well go ahead relieve your stress, kick bucket all you want,
# A cigarette that never mattered's all you stuck with

# I knew this kid named Alberto
# Funny style cat
# And his girl looked like a turtle
# Not Lisa Turtle, just a turtle
# High school track
# He ran the hurdle
# His peers shed tears senior year when he got murdered
# Now Alberto was your average A student
# Participated in class,
# Never came late
# And never truant
# His family was picture perfect
# His older sister was prom queen
# His dad a decorated vet from the Vietnam team
# His mother was Dear Abby,
# An ordinary house wife
# Like clockwork, always had dinner on the table at 5
# But Alberto had a monster he kept under his bed
# Instead of letting it out,
# He just got a girlfriend instead
# She knew something was funny
# Shecould tell by his behavior
# Or the way he flamboyantly shook his hand
# When he would wave to her
# She thought nothing of it
# And just shoved it in the closet
# Until the day that word dripped out like leaky faucet
# Alberto was homosexual
# I ain't have nothing against it
# But little Ronnie Johnson and all his football player friends did
# They'd always pick and nag
# Call him 'f**' and such and such
# And couldn't wait to get to gym so they could really bust his nuts
# The gym teacher never cared
# He'd just join in on the action
# He'd make silly gestures
# And compared him to Micheal Jackson
# Alberto couldn't take it
# He'd just stop showing up and whenever he walked them halls
# He just felt like throwin' up
# And night he would cry and cry and ask 'God why?'
# Like 'God, why the f***'d I have to be born this way?'
# God would reply, 'Son, you've gotta show 'em you're more than gay'
# Cause he had dreams to be a track star
# Until that warm April night
# Them gay jokes went way too far
# Ronnie begged for his forgiveness
# And invited him to a party
# Cause his parents went away
# And left him plenty of Bacardi
# Alberto kindly accepted
# He was finally accepted
# Except it was all deception
# And left them all unprotected
# It was a plan Ronnie had scammed
# To get him in the right place
# Verbally degrade and rearrange his pretty face
# The plan would go swiftly
# They started calling him sissy
# One punch turned into fifty
# They beat him till he was dizzy
# Now Alberto lie in blood
# While his peers look on in fear
# He took his last breath
# And passed away his senior year
# Needless to say
# It was one big tragedy
# And how was Ronnie gonna explain to his family,
# While they were on vacation taking in sights
# He got wasted and killed a kid that night
# Don't be a slave and behave the way they do,
# Just utilize the gifts that God gave you
# I knew this girl named Maria
# Bright and talented
# With aspirations to be a
# Big superstar
# What a great idea
# Until she fell off and started to listening to her peers
# Oh dear!
# Now Maria was your typical obnoxious
# Analytical head strong rebel
# Flippin' off the principal
# Single mother home structure
# She looked after baby brother
# While mom worked two jobs
# Just to buy supper
# Pops was a struggling musician
# Troubled man,
# Juggling family and heroin addiction
# He overdosed and left a notice of eviction
# And a crate of records on the table in the kitchen
# And a little angel with a keen sense of sound
# Who saw silence in the records she found
# And she would stay up late at night
# Reciting songs to herself
# Under pale moonlight
# Righting wrongs that her pops made,
# Promised her mom she'd never go that same route
# Turns out
# Carrie Anne had other plans
# Her and her man Ronnie most popular,
# Second best to nobody
# Homecoming queen versus ugly duckling
# And the story ends the same way
# Ok, Ronnie's parents went away for a couple of days
# And told him 'No Drinking'
# What the f*** were they thinking?
# Maria was oblivious that her boyfriend had already been invited
# So when Carrie Anne asked
# She got all excited
# Like 'damn now I got something to look forward to'
# Or so she thought
# Maria kindly accepted,
# Except it was all bullsh**
# Not pay attention,
# Carrie Anne hated Maria cause she could sing
# So she scored a bag of heroin
# But the craziest thing was
# Maria never touched drugs, she did that night
# And when her man was getting beat
# She was nowhere in sight
# Now her boyfriend lie in blood
# And she had no idea
# Alberto passed away and she got hooked her senior year
# Needless to say
# It was one one big tragedy
# And I hate to break it but
# It doesn't end happily
# A warm day in May,
# The sky was so beautiful
# Carrie Anne died in a crash leaving the funeral

# See there was ashley,
# She caught my eye the second that she pasted me

# The jewish chick
# She'd always give me gifts for Chanukkah
# To met her folks she'd try and make me rock a yhomica
# But she looked so dam good
# She almost made my ass convert
# And after that there was Lisa
# She had a twin sister, Teresa
# I bumped into them at Cam's gettin pizza

# Oh sh**
# Remember Shuana
# I hate to bring her up again

# That girl I talked about
# In 'that girls a dog' song
# Yea the poster girl from pac sun
# Almost made me lose my grip
# And oh sh**
# There was Krystal
# The meth head
# She used to sniff like a fist full

# She bugged out and tryed to kill my ass
# And at last we got Kimmy
# She went abroad
# Came back

# 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' t-shirts, and you're assuming I'm tasteless?
# You misconstrue it but your babies will embrace it
# The basic essentials of a very bitter young man
# That kicks rusty soda cans
# And walks on decrepit bricks
# With a permanent pair of headphones
# Trying to make these lectures stick
# I'll let the protestors picket,
# Like they are going to make a difference
# And watch them die before they realize that their cause was nonexistent
# And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose)
# Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless)
# But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
# Content with the fact that I know this city's mine
# And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose)
# Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless)
# But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
# Content with the fact that I know this city's mine
# I walk on sh**ty city sidewalks stepping on every single crack
# Reminiscent of that joke we used to say when we were snotty nose
# My purpose got defeated when my mom turned paraplegic,
# Plus I failed my civil service exam,
# They said I cheated.
# :not to mention tainted urine samples and the attention span of a second-grader
# More fascinated with building blocks than wasting time stressing his daily lesson
# Hence the ridilin I've been gone with the wind like lucky lottery tickets since day one (one)
# I stepped on the left cause rights wrong (wrong)
# So what do I do?I resort to friendly games of ping pong and sing a song of sixpence
# I'm none the richer, I just kiss her on the lips and keep trucking
# And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose)
# Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless)
# But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
# Content with the fact that I know this city's mine
# And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose)
# Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless)
# But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
# Content with the fact that I know this city's mine

# I took cutie for a ride in my deathcab
# She tipped me with a kiss I dropped her off at the meth lab
# Before she left she made a dashboard confessional
# And spilled her guts in cursive but whats worse is
# I could still see her bright eyes like sunny day real estate
# Oh my and in a funny way it irritates
# So high but no chance
# My little chemical romance left a bad taste in my mouth
# But I imposed her like hey mercedes why the long face
# Why you cryin? theres no need
# Just put on this coheed and fallout
# Boy meets girl jimmy eat world
# But Schlep eats pills till hes all out
# Not once not twice she was thrice times a lady
# Mackin on brand new, but I had to
# Bounce over to the postal service to
# Pick up these pills that take care of my nervousness
# And all the way I saw planes that were mistooken for stars
# She played games but she took em too far
# At the drive in
# Watching soft porn and you can tell
# By the trail of the dead, that there was somethin in the popcorn
# I hop in my cab destination midtown
# Just to get up with some kids that like to get down
# I'd made my rounds and that was that
# In between the frowns and scraps and heart attacks
# And I remember I seen her ass in early november
# On a thursday takein back sunday for a refund
# She shot a wink like no hard feelings
# Then she jetted to brazil man them pills had me spun
# This is the story of the year right here
# This is hot water music
# Put ya ramen into it

# Now who you know leave the scene
# Messier than canvas's by Jackson Pollock
# Throwing multicolored thoughts at a rapid pace
# I make a mess you dissect it and make sense of it
# Then get back to me at your earliest convenience
# Check my verbal sequence as I texturize these tracks
# Seven layers to be exact eliminate the whack
# With a firm brush stroke I mc paintily
# Lyricists begin crumbling from my scumbling technique
# As I tweak your audio and visual keep my drips minimal messages subliminal
# Cause me and rap go way back we compliment
# So together we enhance one another that's common sense
# High intensity catches the eye your jaw drops
# Be a real critic not explicit with false props
# I keep my darks deep my lights bright I'm very thorough
# With my churascurro inspiration spark and a knife
# Now watch me rock the spot like ? minus the heroin
# And make my face popular like Andy did to Marilyn
# Its kinda scary when real art gets left behind
# While they take bullsh** and start sellin it to blind folks
# But I remain humble as long as ? continues spinnin hot sh**
# On his twin twelve-hundred color wheels of steel
# f*** mass appeal art is art only the real can truly feel it
# So open your eyes and listen
# Combine your ears with vision
# Or do it cause you love it
# Or for cash that's your decision
# That's your decision
# That's your decision
# Its like I'm torn between two worlds
# A paintbrush and a microphone
# A canvas or a beat
# CD or LP
# Anything goes when my ink pen flows
# And God only knows where its gonna bring me next
# So I'm inclined to like paint rhymes and spit kaleidoscopes with one eye closed
# And I suppose if you chose the path that I chose
# You know the cycle ass ho don't front
# It goes inspiration and productivity then a sense of self worth and in steps depression
# Like back and forth and forth and back
# Should I paint a picture or record a track
# A gift or a curse I don't know I'm still undecided
# But over the years I've found clever ways to hide it
# And those that lack the passion I have may despise it
# But my momma made me this way I thank her everyday
# So tell them kids to keep coloring outside the lines
# Until they lose they limitations and they minds is free
# Tell them teachers that you want your money back this time
# And tell Bob Ross for all the happy little trees
# And tell my momma that her baby boy is doing just fine
# Although hes running out of patience but his mind is free
# And tell my pops that I'll pay his money back sometime
# And that his son is two steps away from where he needs to be

# The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth (3X)
# Chorus: repeat 2X
# Life is a test many quest the universe
# And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt
# The first shall be last and the last shall be first
# The basic instructions before leaving earth
# Verse One:
# Knowledge this wisdom, this goes back when I was twelve
# I loved doing right but I was trapped in hell
# Had mad ideas, sad eyes and tears
# Years of fears, but yo my foes couldn't bear
# I searched for the truth since my youth
# And went to church since birth, but it wasn't worth the loot
# that I was paying, plus the praying
# I didn't like staying cuz of busy-bodies and dizzy hotties
# That the preacher had souped up with lies
# Had me cooped up lookin at loot, butt, and thighs
# Durin the service, he swallowed up the poor
# And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor
# But I ignored, and explored my history that was untold
# And watched mysteries unfold
# And dropped a jewel like Solomon, but never followed men
# cause if you do your brain is more hollow than
# Space oblivia, or the abyss
# With no trace of trivia, left with the hiss
# Does it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind?
# From a slave we was kept from the mind
# And from the caves he crept from behind
# And what he gave, was the sect of the swine
# When the bible, it condemned the pig
# I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs
# But we used to wear a turban, but now we're in the urban
# No more wearing beanies and dress like a genie
# No hocus pocus cause I focus on the facts
# And put it on the tracks and brought it through the wax
# I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time
# And too much knowledge, it might break up the ryhme
# I did it anyway just to wake up the mind
# of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet
# Those who sit home, or sell books by the market
# Need to chill and get their mind revived
# For years religion did nothing but divide
# The basic instructions before leaving earth
# Chorus
# Verse Two:
# I strolled through the books of Job to unfold
# And open bibles, instead of hoping on revivals
# Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah
# when he hardly knew ya, that's how the devil's fooled ya
# See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend
# Why should you die to go to heaven?
# The Earth is already in space, the bible I embrace
# A difficult task I had to take
# I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when
# I found out that we were the chosen
# I deal with the truth, and build with the youth
# And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
# Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted wth foolish men
# and women with wicked minds, who build picket signs
# to legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion
# I quiz Son with my wisdom
# Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted
# The study of wisdom, I perferred it
# The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
# I even learnt Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edam
# The white image, of Christ, is really Cesare Borgia
# and uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander
# The Sixth of Rome, and once the picture was shown
# That's how the devils tricked my dome
# I prophesized to save a man, but no one gave a damn
# for my nation - the seed of Abraham
# Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
# Now we're strung on needles, and some are plungin evils
# So study and be wise in these days of darkness
# Peace to my nephew Marcus
# The basic instructions before leaving earth
# Chorus: repeat to fade
> Gza
# Intro One: (not included on 7")
# When I was little... my father was famous.
# He was the greatest sam-urai in the empire;
# and he was the Shogun's decapitator.
# He cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty-one lords.
# It was a bad time for the empire.
# The Shogun just stayed inside his castle -- and he never came out.
# People said his brain was infected by DEVILS.
# My father would come home -- he would forget about the killings.
# He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him.
# Maybe that was the problem.
# Then, one night... the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house.
# They were supposed to kill my father... but they didn't.
# woman screams*
# That was the night everything changed *voice fades*
# Intro Two: RZA
# See, sometimes...
# You gotta flash em back
# See niggaz don't know where this shit started
# Y'all know where it came from
# I'm sayin we gonna take y'all back to the source
# We bounce, yo
# Chorus: RZA, GZA
# When the MC's came, to live our their name
# And to perform (forrrrm)
# Some had, to snort cocaine (caiiinnne) to act insane (sannne)
# with before Pete Rock-ed it on, now gone
# that the mental plane (plaaanne) to spark the brain (brainnn)
# with the building to be born
# Yo RZA flip the track with the what to gut
# Check em check chicka icka etta UHH
# Verse One:
# Fake niggaz get flipped
# In mic fights I swing swords and cut clown
# Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
# I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
# on some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
# But it was yo out the shop stolen art
# Catch a swollen heart from not rollin smart
# I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
# Shit's played, like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
# That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
# My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
# Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
# With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
# that attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
# I represent from midnight to high noon
# I don't waste ink, nigga I think
# I drop megaton BOMBS more faster than you blink
# Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
# Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
# Only under one circumstance is if I'm blunted
# Turn that shit up, my "Clan in Da Front" want it
# Chorus
# Verse Two:
# I'm on a Mission, that niggaz say is Impossible
# But when I swing my swords they all choppable
# I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
# Child educator, plus head amputator
# Cause niggaz styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
# Lyrics are weak, like clock radio speakers
# Don't even stop in my station and attack
# while your plan failed, hit the rail, like Amtrak
# What the fuck for?  Down by low, I make law
# I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
# round the clock, that state pen time check it
# With the pens I be stickin but you can't stick to crime
# Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
# I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
# (when the MC's..) Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
# Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
# It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
# So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
# Niggaz are fascinated how the shit begin
# Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin
# Chorus
