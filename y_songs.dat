# Waking up alone
# in a room that still reminds me
# My heart has got to learn to forget
# Starting on my own
# With every breath I'm getting stronger
# This is not the time for regret
# 'Cause I don't need to hang on
# to heartbreak
# When there's so much of life left to live
# "chorus"
# Love is on the way
# On wings of angels
# I know it's true, I feel it coming through
# Love is on the way
# Time is turning the pages
# I don't know when
# But love will find me again
# I am not afraid
# Of the mystery of tomorrow
# I have found the faith deep within
# There's a promise I have made
# There's a dream I'm gonna follw
# There's another chance to begin
# And it's coming as sure as the heavens
# I can feel it right here in my heart
# (chorus)
# (Oh I know, I know down deep
# down in my heart I know that....)
# (chorus)
# I don't know when
# But love will find me again....

> Yazoo
# Midnight it's raining outside he must be soaking wet
# Everyone is sleeping tight God knows I tried my best
# Darling you know it looks bad
# Just lost the best thing that I ever had
# Still I don't know why I did him wrong
# It's too late now he's gone to say
# Baby oh no, can't leave me now
# Said think about it please
# 'Cos I love you and I need you
# And I should have thought of that before I did you wrong
# Heartache, heartache yeah
# When I saw his face I could see how bad I'd let him down
# Cheating when he was working hard, I just had to mess around
# I knew from the start he ain't got much money
# I should have stayed content with all that good sweet honey
# He's a good strong man and I love him so
# so how on earth can I let him go
# Baby oh no, can't leave me now
# Said think about it please
# 'Cos I love you and I need you
# And I should have thought of that before I did you wrong
# And now it's midnight it's raining outside
# And I'm soaking wet, still looking for that man of mine
# And I ain't found him yet
# Well all of this rain can wash away my tears
# But nothing can replace all of those wasted years
# In all of this I tell you I have learnt
# Playing with fire gets you burnt
# And I'm still burning
# Baby oh no, can't leave me now
# Said think about it please
# 'Cos I love you and I need you
# And I should have thought of that before I did you wrong
# You say you'll lose your pride
# Well don't you know dear, don't you know
# I'll lose so much more if you go now
# Oh no...
