# Have you heard of the saying
# for those who are playing
# You don't know what you've got till it's gone
# Well that was my calling, I knew I was falling
# Intro something that would be so wrong
# But i caught hold of myself
# and changed for the better
# I can't get you out of my mind
# Cause something inside made me
# realise you were fine
# (Chorus)
# Each time when we're alone,
# I guess I didn't know
# How far we were apart,
# should've spoken to my heart
# I guess I didn't know that each time
# you'd go away I'd cry
# I can't take all these good-byes
# I know from this feeling,
# deep inside there's a healing
# I know that I'm in control
# Every day I am yearning, this love I feel burning
# Burning right through my soul
# So let's make a start of
# something that cannot be broken
# The mould is so strong, treat this love like a child
# That grows into something worthwhile
# (Chorus)
# Deep, love so deep, deep love so deep, yeah
# I can't take all these good-byes
# Faithfully I will be, you will see, please believe me
# I can't take all these good-byes
# (Chorus)
# All the time we were alone
# Guess I shold've really known
# Baby you have always been mine

# Last night I was
# Takin' a walk along the river
# And I saw him
# Together with a young girl
# And the look that he gave her
# Made me shiver
# Cause he always used to
# Look at me that way
# And I thought
# Maybe I should walk
# Right up to her and say
# It's a game he
# Likes to play
# Repeat
# Look into his angel eyes
# One look and
# You're hypnotized
# He'll take your heart
# And you must pay the price
# Look into his angel eyes
# You'll think you're
# In paradise
# And one day you'll
# Find out he
# Wears a disguise
# Don't look too deep
# Into those angel eyes
# Sometimes when I'm lonely
# I sit and think about him
# And it hurts to remember
# All the good times
# When I thought
# I could never live without him
# And I wonder
# Does it have to be the same
# Every time
# When I see him
# Will it bring back
# All the pain
# How can I forget that name

# Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
# You're enchained by your own sorrow
# In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
# How I hate to see you like this
# There is no way you can deny it
# I can see that you're, oh, so sad, so quiet
# Chiquitita, tell the truth
# I'm a shoulder you can cry on
# Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
# You were always sure of yourself
# Now I see you've broken a feather
# I hope we can patch it up together

# Chiquitita, you and I know
# How the heartaches come and they go
# And the scars they're leavin'
# You'll be dancin' once again and the pain will end
# You will have no time for grievin'
# Chiquitita, you and I cry
# But the sun is still in the sky and shinin' above you
# Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
# Sing a new song, Chiquitita
# Try once more like you did before
# Sing a new song, Chiquitita
# So the walls came tumblin' down
# And your love's a blown-out candle
# All is gone and it seems too hard to handle

# Can you hear the drums Fernando
# I remember long ago another starry night like this
# In the firelight Fernando
# You were humming to yourself
# And softly strumming your guitar
# I could hear the distant drums
# And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
# They were closer now Fernando
# Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
# I was so afraid Fernando
# We were young and full of life
# And none of us prepared to die
# And I'm not ashamed to say
# The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
# There was something in the air that night
# The stars were bright, Fernando
# They were shining there for you and me
# For liberty, Fernando
# Though we never thought that we could lose
# There's no regret
# If I had to do the same again
# I would my friend, Fernando
# If I had to do the same again
# I would my friend, Fernando
# Now we're old and grey Fernando
# And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
# Can you hear the drums Fernando
# Do you still recall the fateful night
# We crossed the Rio Grande
# I can see it in your eyes
# How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
# There was something in the air that night
# The stars were bright, Fernando
# They were shining there for you and me
# For liberty, Fernando
# Though we never thought that we could lose
# There's no regret
# If I had to do the same again
# I would my friend, Fernando

# Yes, if I had to do the same again

# I see the distant lights that left bejine the day
# But what I see is so much more than I can say
# and I see you in midnight blue
# I see you crting now you've found a lot of pain
# and and what you searching for can never be the same
# but what's the difference cos' they say what's in a name
# and I see you in midnaight blue
# I will love you tonight,and I will stay by your side
# loving you ,I'm feeling midnight blue

# Vise nije to to, malo nam je falilo, ja povukla sam crto vec davno, sto smo bili bilo smo,sad za ljubav prekasno,vrjeme ne radi za nas
# Ako te volim jos i sad, znam, necu priznati, jer uzalu ponos kada ja sebe moram lagati,
# Moram menjati zrak, na oci pade mi mrak, kad te vidim kako glumis mi sad, nije misto

# Learn how to love her
# With all of her faults
# She gave more than she's taken

# The Hollywood Waltz
> Eagles
# On a dark desert highway
# Cool wind in my hair
# Warm smell of colitas
# Rising up through the air
# Up ahead in the distance
# I saw a shimmering light
# My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim
# I had to stop for the night
# There she stood in the doorway
# I heard the mission bell
# And I was thinking to myself
# This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
# Then she lit up a candle
# And she showed me the way
# There were voices down the corridor
# I thought I heard them say
# Welcome to the Hotel California
# Such a lovely place
# Such a lovely place (background)
# Such a lovely face
# Plenty of room at the Hotel California
# Any time of year
# Any time of year (background)
# You can find it here
# You can find it here
# Her mind is Tiffany twisted
# She's got the Mercedes bends
# She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
# That she calls friends
# How they dance in the courtyard
# Sweet summer sweat
# Some dance to remember
# Some dance to forget
# So I called up the Captain
# Please bring me my wine
# He said
# We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
# And still those voices are calling from far away
# Wake you up in the middle of the night
# Just to hear them say
# Welcome to the Hotel California
# Such a lovely Place
# Such a lovely Place (background)
# Such a lovely face
# They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
# What a nice surprise
# What a nice surprise (background)
# Bring your alibies
# Mirrors on the ceiling
# Pink champagne on ice
# And she said
# We are all just prisoners here
# Of our own device
# And in the master's chambers
# They gathered for the feast
# They stab it with their steely knives
# But they just can't kill the beast
# Last thing I remember
# I was running for the door
# I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
# Relax said the nightman
# We are programed to recieve
# You can check out any time you like
# But you can never leave

# Look at us baby, up all night
# Tearing our love apart
# Aren't we the same two people who live

# Ahh...
# Every time I try to walk away
# Something makes me turn around and stay
# And I can't tell you why
# When we get crazy,
# it just ain't to right,
# Girl, I get lonely,too
# You don't have to worry
# Just hold on tight
# 'Cause I love you
# Nothing's wrong as far as I can see

# I wish you peace when the cold winds blow
# Warmed by the fire's glow
# I wish you comfort in the, the lonely time
# And arms to hold you when you ache inside
# I wish you hope when things are going bad
# Kind words when times are sad
# I wish you shelter from the, the raging wind
# Cooling waters at the fever's end
# I wish you peace when times are hard
# The light to guide you through the dark
# And when storms are high and your, your dreams are low
# I wish you the strength to let love grow on,
# I wish you the strength to let love flow,
# I wish you peace when times are hard
# A light to guide you through the dark
# And when storms are high and your, you dreams are low

# Somewhere out there on that horizon
# Our beyond the neon lights
# I know there must be somethin' better
# but there's nowhere else in sight
# It's survival in the city
# When you live from day to day
# City streets don't have much pity
# When you're down, that's where you'll stay
# In the city,oh,oh.
# In the city
# I was born here in the city
# With my back against the wall
# Nothing grows, and life ain't very pretty
# No one's there to catch you when you fall
# Somewhere out on that horizon

# It's just another day in paradise
# As you stumble to your bed
# You'd give anything to silence
# Those voices ringing in your head
# You thought you could find happiness
# Just over that green hill
# You thought you would be satisfied
# But you never will-
# Learn to be still
# We are like sheep without a shepherd
# We don't know how to be alone
# So we wander 'round this desert
# And wind up following the wrong gods home
# But the flock cries out for another
# And they keep answering that bell
# And one more starry-eyed messiah
# Meets a violent farewell-
# Learn to be still
# Learn to be still
# Now the flowers in your garden
# They don't smell so sweet
# Maybe you've forgotten
# The heaven lying at your feet
# -Solo-
# There are so many contridictions
# In all these messages we send
# How do I get out of here
# Where do I fit in?
# Though the world is torn and shaken
# Even if your heart is breakin'
# It's waiting for you to awaken
# And someday you will-
# Learn to be still
# Learn to be still
# You just keep on runnin'

# He was a hard-headed man he was brutally handsome

# They threw outrageous parties
# They paid heavenly bills
# There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face

# City girls just seem to find out early
# How to open doors with just a smile
# A rich old man
# And she won't have to worry
# She'll dress up all in lace and go in style
# Late at night a big old house gets lonely
# I guess ev'ry form of refuge has its price
# And it breaks her heart to think her love is
# Only given to a man with hands as cold as ice
# So she tells him she must go out for the evening
# To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
# But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
# She is headed for the cheatin' side of town
# You can't hide your lyin' eyes
# And your smile is a thin disguise
# I thought by now you'd realize
# There ain't no way to hide your lyin eyes
# On the other side of town a boy is waiting
# with fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
# She drives on through the nice anticipating
# 'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel
# She rushes to his arms,
# They fall together
# She whispers that it's only for awhile
# She swears that soon she'll be comin' back forever
# She pulls away and leaves him with a smile
# You can't hide your lyin' eyes
# And your smile is a thin disguise
# I thought by now you'd realize
# There ain't no way to hide you lyin' eyes
# She gets up and pours herself a strong one
# And stares out at the stars up in the sky
# Another night, it's gonna be a long one
# She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry
# She wonders how it ever got this crazy
# She thinks about a boy she knew in school
# Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
# She's so far gone she feels just like a fool
# My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
# You set it up so well, so carefully
# Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things
# You're still the same old girl you used to be
# You can't hide your lyin eyes
# And your smile is a thin disguise
# I thought by now you'd realize

# And we would sing right out loud
# The things we could not say
# We thought we could change this world
# With words like "love" and "freedom"

# Inside the Sad Cafe
# Oh, expecting to fly

# Now that Glory Train, it don't
# stop here no more
# Now I look at the years gone by
# And wonder at the powers that be
# I don't know why fortune smiles on some
# And lets the rest go free
# Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall

# Well, I'm running down the road
# tryin' to loosen my load
# I've got seven women on my mind,
# Four that wanna own me,
# Two that wanna stone me,
# One says she's a friend of mine
# Take It easy, take it easy
# Don't let the sound of your own wheels
# drive you crazy
# Lighten up while you still can
# don't even try to understand
# Just find a place to make your stand
# and take it easy
# Well, I'm a standing on a corner
# in Winslow, Arizona
# and such a fine sight to see
# It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed
# Ford slowin' down to take a look at me
# Come on, baby, don't say maybe
# I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
# We may lose and we may win though
# we will never be here again
# so open up, I'm climbin' in,
# so take it easy
# Well I'm running down the road trying to loosen
# my load, got a world of trouble on my mind
# lookin' for a lover who won't blow my
# cover, she's so hard to find
# Take it easy, take it easy
# don't let the sound of your own
# wheels make you crazy
# come on baby, don't say maybe
# I gotta know if your sweet love is
# gonna save me, oh oh oh
# Oh we got it easy

# All alone at the end of the of the evening
# And the bright lights have faded to blue
# I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
# Loved me and I never knew
# You know I've always been a dreamer
# And it's so hard to change
# But the dreams I've seen lately
# Keep on turning out and burning out
# And turning out the same
# So put me on a highway
# And show me a sign
# And take it to the limit one more time
# You can spend all your time making money
# You can spend all your love making time
# If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
# Would you still be mine?
# And when you're looking for your freedom
# And you can't find the door
# When there's nothing to believe in
# Still you're coming back, you're running back
# You're coming back for more
# So put me on a highway
# And show me a sign
# And take it to the limit one more time
# Take it to the limit
# Take it to the limit
# Take it to the limit one more time

# Open up your eyes

# and you're so hard to find
# the wind outside is cold
# restless feeling in my soul
# tempting me to get away
# but there's no place a man can go
# God, will you lead me where I roam?
# Help me not to let my feelings show
# No, No You are the one, oh, how could you be
# so blind?
# the devil prays on runaways
# he's never far behind
# the many years I've tried
# Now have been revealed to me
# closer is the love you'll find

# Stare out the window,
# You can't make the time go
# You don't even know why you're here
# Wait for the weekend to go off the deep end
# and make everything disappear
# You're lost in a teenage jail
# So you and so vicious and so frail
# where something is always for sale
# You're lost in a teenage jail.
# You're not like your mothers.
# you're not like the others
# You're not quite like anyone else,
# They don't even know you,
# Got nothing to show you,
# So get something good for yourself

# It's another tequila sunrise
# Starin' slowly 'cross the sky, said goobye
# He was just a hired hand
# Workin' on the dreams he planned to try
# The days go by
# Ev'ry night when the sun goes down
# Just another lonely boy in town
# And she's out runnin' 'round
# She wasn't just another woman
# And I couldn't keep from comin' on
# It's been so long
# Oh, and it's a hollow feelin' when
# It comes down to dealin' friends
# It never ends
# Take another shot of courage
# Wonder why the right words never come

# Every night I'm lyin' in bed

# And comin' apart at the seams
# We try to talk it over
# But the words come out to rough
# I know you were tryin'
# to give me the best of your love
# Beautiful faces and loud, empty places
# Look at the way that we live
# Wastin' our time on cheap talk and wine
# Left us so little to give
# That same old crowd
# Was like a cold dark cloud
# That we could never rise above
# But here in my heart I give you the best of my love
# Oh sweet darlin' you get the best of my love, oh
# Sweet darlin', you get the best of my love
# I'm goin' back in time
# And it's a sweet dream
# It was a quiet night
# And I would be all right
# If i could go on sleepin'
# But every mornin'
# I wake up and worry
# What's gonna happen today
# You see it your way
# And I see it mine
# But we both see it slippin' away
# You know we always had each other baby
# I guess that wasn't enough
# Oh, but here in my heart
# I give you the best of my love
# Oh, sweet darlin'
# You get the best of my love
# Oh, sweet darlin'
# You get the best of my love

# It wasn't reall sad the way they said good-bye
# Or maybe it just hurt so bad she couldn't cry
# He packed his things, walked out the door and drove away
# And she became the girl from yesterday
# He took a plane across the sea
# To some foreign land
# She stayed at home and tried to understand
# How someone who had been so close could be so far away
# And she became the girl from yesterday
# She doesn't know what's right
# She doesn't know what's wrong
# She only knows the pain that comes from waiting for so long
# And she doesn't count the teardrops
# That she's cried while he's away
# Because she knows deep in her heart
# That he'll be back someday
# The light's on in the window; she's waiting by the phone
# Talking to a memory that's never coming home
# She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say
# But she'll always be the girl from yesterday
# Yeh, she'll always be the girl from yesterday

# Well, he sits up there on his leatherette
# Looks through pictures of the ones that he hasn't had yet
# When he thinks he wants a closer look,
# he gets out his little black telephone book
# "Come sit down here beside me, honey.

# She came from Providence, the one in Rhode Island
# where the old world shadows hang heavy in the air.
# She packed her hopes and dreams like a refugee,
# just as her father came across the sea.
# She heard about a place people were smilin',
# they spoke about the red man's way, how they loved the land.
# And they came from everywhere to the Great Divide
# seeking a place to stand or a place to hide.
# Down in the crowded bars out for a good time,
# can't wait to tell you all what it's like up there.
# And they called it paradise, I don't know why.
# Somebody laid the mountains low while the town got high.
# Then the chilly winds blew down across the desert,
# through the canyons of the coast to the Malibu
# where the pretty people play hungry for power
# to light their neon way and give them things to do.
# Some rich man came and raped the land, nobody caught 'em,
# put up a bunch of ugly boxes and, Jesus, people bought 'em.
# And they called it paradise, the place to be,
# they watched the hazy sun sinking in the sea.
# You can leave it all behind and sail to Lahaina
# just like the missionaries did so many years ago.
# They even brought a neon sign 'Jesus is Coming',
# brought the white man's burden down, brought the white man's reign.
# Who will provide the grand design, what is yours and what is mine?
# 'Cause there is no more new frontier, we have got to make it here.
# We satisfy our endless needs and justify our bloody deeds
# in the name of destiny and in the name of God.
# And you can see them there on Sunday morning
# stand up and sing about what it's like up there.
# They called it paradise, I don't know why.

# Out in the shiny night, the rain

# The tracks that ran down the boulevard had
# all been washed away
# Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling
# And I remember the times we spent
# inside the Sad Cafe
# Oh, it seemed like a holy place,
# protected by amazing grace
# And we would sing right out loud, the
# things we could not say
# We thought we could change this world
# with words like "love" and "freedom"
# We were part of the lonely crowd
# Inside the Sad Cafe
# Oh, expecting to fly,
# we would meet on that shore in the
# sweet by and by
# Some of their dreams came true,
# some just passed away
# And some of the stayed behind
# inside the Sad Cafe.
# The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
# Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more
# Now I look at the years gone by,
# and wonder at the powers that be.
# I don't know why fortune smiles on some
# and let's the rest go free
# Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall
# But things in this life change very slowly,

# There's no use in asking why,

# And not let me stay around?
# Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
# What used to be right is wrong
# Can love that's lost be found?
# For awhile, to love each other with all
# We would ever need
# Love was strong for so long
# Never knew that what was
# Wrong, oh, baby, wasn't right
# We tried to find what we had
# Till sadness was all we shared
# We were scared
# This affair would lead our love into

# Verse 1
# I used to find myself dreaming of you
# Hoping that one day my dream would come true.
# And suddenly out of the blue
# You looked at me and said you loved me too
# Verse 2
# Our love was so special, it made me so glad,
# There was nothing to compare with this thing that we had.
# We used to take long walks on the beach
# With you by my side there's nothing I couldnt reach
# And,
# Chorus:
# Now I'm left here lying in my river of tears,
# And thats where I'm gonna lay for the rest of my years
# Until you come and take away all my fears
# And pull me out from the pain, in my river of tears
# I didnt know our love was slipping away
# I tried to find something worthy to say
# But it was too late when by the time I knew
# I watched you leave with nothing that I could do.
# I shouldn't have ever let your go
# oh  oh yeeeaaaahhhh
# Chorus
# Instrumental Break
# Now I'm left here lying in my river of tears,
# And thats where I'm gonna lay for the rest of my years

# Last Verse ( rap )
# Girl you got me drowning in your river of tears
# I Cant believe you i was with you after all these years
# So you found a new man i can deal with that
# I wished upon a star that i had you back
# Your from tenesee you played in the snow
# you Planted you favorite flower and hoped that it would growed
# You like Scarey movies and ice cream on a stick
# We used to go to the beach take walks till 6
# I remember we watched the sunset on your fathers dock
# We stood on the shore trying to skip rocks
# I you hung the memories peacefully on the wall
# I hope this river of tears doesnt flow that far
# yeah
# Chorus
# Now I'm left here lying in my river of tears,
# And thats where I'm gonna lay for the rest of my years

# [Verse 1: Ed O.G.]
# Now righteous is the way I live, that's how I gotta live
# A girl don't seem to want you unless you got somethin to give
# But that's not positive, and it's a trip
# The younger girls are sweatin a gangster, older girls are on the dealer's dick
# When I was livin foul, hey yo, I was knocked plenty, troops
# But since I changed my lifestyle I can't get any boots
# Dealin and gangbangin, it might be negative
# But I can't knock it, cause we all gotta live
# It's the girls, the way they act, that really gets to me
# Because I said "Excuse me" from the front seat of a hooptie?
# Nobody gased me, nobody souped me
# Yeah, I'm a dog, girl, but I ain't Snoopy
# I know why you play me, cause the car wasn't hooked
# I know I look good, so it couldn't be my looks
# But that's more foul than a third-string center
# Givin me the cold shoulder, and it ain't winter?
# But that's how the '90s is, it is wack
# If you ain't got no money, then you ain't got jack
# Gotta have money to make it with the ladies in the nineties

# [Verse 2: Ed O.G.]
# I'm tired of a girl playin innocent
# When she know damn well she's a freak
# Yeah, she can't accept I'm livin righteous
# So she wants to fight this
# And kicks it to a sucker in a jeep - why?
# Because he got a car and I ride the bus
# Hey yo, but I won't get locked up when five-o makes the bust
# But it seems girls' dreams is the money and the jeeps
# And all the foul fellas get the flyest of the freaks
# They like the guys with the gold that's mackin right in check
# And they love it when they're locked up callin 'em collect
# And when a righteous brother like me takes a step and walks up
# It's like "Do you have a boyfriend?" "Yeah, but he's locked up"
# I say, "How can you have a boyfriend if he's locked up?
# He's probably somebody's girlfriend and he's gettin knocked up"
# But that's how the '90s is, it is wack
# If you ain't got no money, then you ain't got jack
# [Verse 3: Ed O.G.]
# If you're involved with a fine girl, your bank in a knot
# You think that she loves you, but she loves what you got
# You can't get without givin, without givin you can't get
# A sucker thinks she's sweatin but she's sweatin your pocket
# To get a little you gots to give a lot
# It don't matter how you look, it matters what you got
# And if you ain't got a car, link or bank
# Don't think you gonna get some cause boy, you ain't
# If you're a f-l-y g-u-y type of guy
# Steppin to a girl without no m-o-n-e-y
# You must be crazy cause she ain't givin
# The first thing that she asks you is, "What you do for a livin?"
# If you're livin foul or if you're livin right
# As long as you got money, she's yours for the night
# But that's how the '90s is, it is wack
# If you ain't got no money, then you ain't got jack

# now there are three steps to heaven
# just listen and you will plainly see
# and as life travels on and things do go wrong
# just follow steps one, two and three
# step one, you find a girl you love
# step two, she falls in love with you
# step three, you kiss and hold her tightly
# yeah that sure seems like heaven to me

# ooh, well i got a girl with a record machine

# we love to dance on a saturday night
# all alone where i can hold her tight
# but she lives on the twentiest floor uptown
# the elevator's broken down
# so i walked one, two flight, three flight, four
# five, six, seven flight, eight flight, more
# up on the twelfth i started to drag
# fifteenth floor i'm a-ready to sag
# get to the top, i'm too tired to rock
# when she calls me up on the telephone
# say, come on over honey, i'm all alone
# i said, baby you're mighty sweet
# but i'm in bed with the achin' feet
# this went on for a couple of days
# but i couldn't stay away
# well they sent to chicago for repairs
# till it's a-fixed i'm a-usin' the stairs
# hope they hurry up before it's too late
# want my baby too much to wait
# all this climbin' is a-gettin' me down

# Was it out of shame?

# Angeli živijo,
# Tudi če ljudje ne čutijo,
# Angeli živijo,
# V vsako dušo tiho pridejo,
# Na srečno pot nas spremljajo,
# Nas spremljajo, varujejo.
# Ostal sem sam, ko je nekdo
# Za kratek čas odprl nebo.
# Za svetlobo dneva sem zahvalil se
# In takrat sem videl, kje je upanje.

# Ne smem predolgo v sonce gledati,
# kdor kot jaz doživlja svojo pot,
# zaigram vlogo norca,
# ki prodaja smeh,
# toda v soncu kane solza in izda srce.
# In ljudje so polni razumevanja,
# jaz pa zbežim, želim si biti sam,
# kajti moja je ta bol
# morda je vse, kar še imam,
# To je solza, ki je ne prodam.
# Sicer na tržnici pred cerkvijo,
# za denar se skoraj vse dobi,
# a gorje, kdor prepozno se zave tega,
# da kupiti nekaterih se stvari ne da.
# Ne želim tolažbe, ne usmiljenja
# In tudi ti, ne vračaj se dekle,
# kajti moja je ta bol
# morda je vse, kar še imam,
# To je solza, ki je ne prodam.
# kajti moja je ta bol

# Welcome back to earth my fine young lucky southern son
# How was your trip to outer-space it sure did look like fun
# You seem somewhat puzzled like you just can't readjust
# You're covered in the battle scars and pitted up with rust
# And your mom and dad have missed you and I'm sure your friends agree
# There's no substitute for solitude and anonymity
# Chorus:
# I'm just coming down from this cloud ahead
# World was spinning around the voices echo things that she said
# I'm just coming down from this starry sky
# I'm just glad to be here and most of all I'm thankful I'm alive
# I hear the whispers in the crowd from jealous tongues
# Shadows from the shameful light my ego's come undone
# And your dignity has missed you and I'm sure your soul agrees
# This fire sale has cost you your pace and sanity
# The path that I must take will lead me to despair
# When I'm a million miles away will no one even care

# Hey Tink it's me Peter, I know it's been a long, long time
# I hope you and the lost boys are doing just as fine
# As that time we showed that Captain Hook and Smee a thing or two
# I think you know why I'm rhyming and I hope that you're not blue
# You see I'll keep you in my heart and you'll always be my friend
# But I can't come back to Neverland again
# You see I've found this great adventure and it's stronger than the Pan
# And the path that I follow will help me be a man
# And I know there will be times that I will wish for fairy's dust
# You know I've found a good woman and she's cleaning up the rust
# From this battered-up heart that's made of junkyard tin
# But I can't come back to Neverland again
# No I can't come back to Neverland again
# I still want to hear the stories of treasure ships and fights
# And all the daring rescues and all the full moon nights
# Sprinkled with the light from stars above
# And Tink you know you'll always have my everlasting love
# So just clap your hands and count back down to ten
# But I can't come back to Neverland again
# No I can't come back to Neverland again
# And the years will pass and all my hair turns gray
# And I'll hear your voice while my grandkids play
# And feel your mischief as they kick me in my shins
# But I can't come back to Neverland again
# No I can't come back to Neverland again
# No I can't come back to Neverland again
# No I can't come back to Neverland again

# When footsteps from that Sunday march faded out into the dark
# The melody blows in to ease the pain
# Two thousand years and we're still here fighting over the same old fear
# The muddy steps of hate can't stand this rain
# I'll stand up on this stage as if it was my altar
# I'll face down all the rage and no, I will not falter
# Say I'm good enough to play but not good enough to stay
# In your heart
# The mat on the floor says welcome, the sign on the door says no
# Says 'No coloreds allowed unless you're playing in the show'
# Well I've never seen a color except the ones up in the sky
# When I see this kind of hatred I die a little inside
# I'll stand up on this stage as if it was altar
# I'll face down all this rage and no, I will not falter
# Say I'm good enough to play but not good enough to stay
# And when you finish your song boy you've got to be on your way
# But if I'm good enough to play then I'm good enough to stay
# In your heart
# This one's for the Godfather, Duke, Ella, and the Count
# And for all those who fought their way here no matter the amount
# For all of God's children walking through dumpsters in the back
# Had to finish their show and leave just because their skin was black
# They stood up on the stage as if it was their altar
# They faced down all the rage and no, they did not falter
# They were good enough to play but not good enough to stay
# And when they finished their songs boy they had to be on their way
# They were good enough to play and somehow they've always stayed
# In our hearts
# And if I'm good enough to play then we've got to find the space
# In our hearts

# Say anything, save everything
# If we say nothing this love will die
# Give me just one word, you can scream or whisper
# If you want to stay with me, tell me why
# Say anything
# It's not the words aren't there but they'd only fail my emotions
# Just want to feel this way without chaining you down to some old cliche
# You want water in my hands and we stand waist deep in the ocean
# It's bigger than the sea, it won't let me
# Say just anything, because I feel everything
# I'd rather say nothing than the same old lines
# I think I give you more, something there's no words for
# You don't have to hear me to feel me trying
# To say anything
# Baby I know you try but somtimes I still want to hear it
# Even when the waters calm but lately it's just when there's something wrong
# Why can't we splash around and hold on to that playful spirit
# Oh like we used to do and won't you
# Say anything, save everything
# If we say nothing this love will die
# Give me just one word, you can scream or whisper
# If you want to stay with me tell me why
# Say anything
# This love is true
# Even if you call it by a different name
# And it's still the same, so we'll
# Say anything, feel everything
# I want to be with you so this love can fly
# We'll hang on every word and we'll scream, we'll whisper
# This moment is waiting for you and I

# A little love could pave the way
# Don't keep it tied with the simple lock
# You think it's ordinary but it's not

# Maybe we, we can fight
# All of this pain and loneliness if
# All we are are shooting stars
# Tired of hearing 'bout the bling-bling
# We're so concered with material things
# It's all cars and diamond rings
# And do you think it's gonna to ease your sting
# Cause that's a hole that you can't fill
# Velvet rope overkill
# Free your mind let your heart sing
# And just remember that they're only things

# Well I packed all of my things into this blanket
# To call this year to earn coyotes fill
# Kiss my wife and kids goodbye choke back the quiver in my breath
# And took my first steps into this corridor of death
# If I'm lucky I will make it to a drain
# With 500 of my brothers, I would share the strain
# Of standing in this boxcar praying for rain
# It's the only the way we will quench our thirst
# In these gardens of white crosses
# Growing in the California sand
# In these gardens of white crosses
# We are the children of poverty trying to a make a stand
# If we make it past the border, we will scatter
# Vanish just like smoke in autumn wind
# I will run until my color will not matter
# Hopin' I can find some work or possibly a friend
# There are others who have made it here
# They will show me how to find a job and a place to lay my head
# And I cannot be concerned with dreams of my children
# For there are 5 others in line for my bed
# In these gardens of white crosses
# Growing in the California sand
# In these gardens of white crosses
# We are the children of poverty trying to a make a stand
# I will gladly pick your peaches or clean your hotel rooms
# I will do the jobs American won't do
# With cell phones to their heads and $700 dollar shoes
# I will risk my life ‘cause it's all I have to lose
# Let the devil in the mountains promise me a ride
# Found an 18 wheeler and put all of us inside
# And just outside of victory, 19 of us died
# None of our bodies hit the floor
# And so my wife she still wonders when I'm coming home
# The riches that I promised her for leaving her alone
# I said I would send her all that I could save
# But I ended up in California in an unknown grave
# In these gardens of white crosses growing in the California sand
# In these gardens of white crosses we are the children of poverty trying to a make a stand

# Sometimes I wish there were two of me
# One to stay at home, the other runs free
# One man to hold you, the other's long gone
# Chasing the girls, laughing til dawn
# I'm just wild at heart
# This battle is raging inside
# This double fantasy tears me apart
# I'm wild at heart
# I'm wild at heart
# I can't fill this hole in my life
# The bottom is endlessly deep
# You're the lucky one 'cause you know who you want
# And I wrestle demons alone while you sleep
# Love your way and the things that you say
# But this loneliness creeps in my mind
# I should be happy to live out this life
# But it feels like I'm running out of time

# When, when you come back to me
# I'll welcome you into my heart
# Like we've never been apart

# @SONG She (English)
# Late at night, early morning
# NO LIGHT
# only that from the ruins still glowing on the
# raised ground at the back.
# she:
# false image not my features
# chimera from a thousand years and one night
# were not many consumed
# strides down the heap of  by her blinding sunwheel of power?
# rubble:  but I did get her ruins
# safely over and done with
# visibly exhausted, but not
# injured:
# even if she never fell
# only those who fell for her
# arrives at the bottom:  I left her -
# nearly loses her balance:               not deluded
# not a clue where to look
# only hope-staring eyes
# RED DAWN SKY ON THE EASTERN HORIZON
# goes with conviction in this direction.
# A tallish wall,
# along it:  resembling me this picture
# in a traced outline
# she was ideal and many had been
# struck by her
# Breach
# HARD BACK LIGHT                 in the glow of her once incomparable figure
# it did something to many
# but then got right out of shape
# she proceeds:  I leave her - deluded
# The wall decreases in size, eventually
# disappears but continues underground.
# (NO SUBTERRANEAN LIGHT)
# MIDDAY
# A black block bearing an idol modelled after
# her, a weapon worked in as part of the neck;
# beside it a control post next to a red-bordered
# poster.
# she stops and looks at it:
# beneath the wild scratches of a pen
# I seem to see my own face
# IN THE LIGHT OF THE PRESS
# she realizes this is an illusion.
# The idol melts, the block crumbles into
# countless little fragments.
# she turns around and goes:
# EVENING
# I am leaving her - deluded
# The Monday Ballet
# my idealized profile
# she, in the crowd,  a scissor-cut silhouette in flag cloth
# unrecognized:  through the hole in a banner
# the crowd seemingly
# hope-staring at the sunrise
# on the western horizon
# I am leaving her - not deluded
# SUNSET
# It is not here what I unflaggingly seek
# and it is not nowhere - then anywhere
# NIGHT, ABSOLUTE DARKNESS
# FIELD OF TOMBS
# she fumbles her way through:
# Various corpus delicti, strewn over the path as
# stumbling blocks and snares, on the whole
# completely unrecognizable - mutilated or
# rapidly decaying.
# PHANTASMAGORIAS WHICH RANDOMLY
# FLARE UP:
# (any similarity with her is accidental and
# unintentional). Men badly disguised as women
# with heavily painted lips beneath their beards.
# Blue or green guerrilla combat eye shadow.
# Some carrying rifles, following an old habit,
# aiming up into the black sky, shooting colou-
# red, stupid birds. Others smiling idiot-proof at
# the flower in the barrel.
# A couch
# Orgon accumulators.
# Joan Baez.
# Wild and howling come-on-tators in sacrificial
# lamb dessous en gros and in a pack.
# Spirits of the orphaned ghosts of europe-
# haunting spectres.
# Universal know-all do-gooder ideas.
# An answering machine for final requests as a
# self-firing device.
# Stool
# And at last, for the last time, a hedge of bur-
# ning bushes
# - LIGHT FROM THE BURNING HEDGE -
# chanting the old litany:        IamthatIamthatIamthatIam...
# walks past.
# INCLINATION
# I am leaving them - not deluded
# After the hedge has completely burnt down
# there only remains
# GREY TWILIGHT
# of uncertain origin, from somewhere from
# back and beyond.
# It is not here what I unflaggingly seek
# descends the hill:  it is not elsewhere - so nowhere -
# where else?
# THE LIGHT BECOMES STRONGER -
# her silhouette gets smaller
# and smalle, her contours can
# now hardly be perceived:  the blinding is increasing and so at last over
# I have returned to the place where I've never
# been before
# exit she.)

# He was throwing grain into the ground below, ground below
# With dreary circles of his arm, going slow, very slow
# His cap pulled down roun' his ears to
# hide the smile and watery tears
# My loving wife is so wonderful
# how small seeds gracefully to grow
# into musical things that spring from these rows
# With their musical names and musical sound
# Dreary birds parade across the dreary sky,
# but down below the woman absent mindedly begins to sow,
# how she sows the seeds her husband loved so much,
# but he's no longer here with us
# But her life is so beautiful
# as memories continue to grow
# into musical things that spring from these rows
# With their musical names and musical sound

# zdaj sen se spušča med oba.
# Dve zvezdi skozi noč,
# gresta na daljno pot.
# V modrem steklu vaze,
# tam med odsevi rož,
# dve drobni lučki
# sta si zmeraj bliže.
# Ta noč temni za naju dva,
# ta čas je tih in poln sanj,
# ogorek sije v mrak,
# odpiraš sanjam dlan,
# ne prižigaj luči, v temi

# Sanjarim dan za dnem,
# da si z menoj, srce me boli,

# da sem tvoja, kakor pred letom dni.
# Prazne večere preživljam z drugim
# in ti morda bi se posmehoval,
# moji ljubosumnosti, ki mi v srcu tli,
# še zdaj mi v srcu tli.
# Nora je misel, da grem ljubezen se z njim,

# Living with danger I just can’t win
# I’m always fighting for your love
# Heart breaking, painstaking love I’m in
# When nothing’s ever good enough
# When you tell me that you need me
# And then you turn around and treat me like a fool
# It makes me think I’m crazy
# Cause I thought that love was meant to be for two
# The more I love you (boy the less I have you)
# Oh what oh what am I gonna do?
# The more I need you (boy the less I see you)
# Oh what oh what am I gonna do?
# You say you do but then you don’t
# You’re up and down I’m so confused what do you want? oh woah
# The more I love you (boy the less I have you)
# Oh what oh what am I gonna do?
# Fighting to win at a losing game
# Like chasing shadows in the dark
# Blowing the sparks of a dying flame
# I don’t know why I try so hard
# When you tell me that you need me
# And then you turn around and treat me like a fool
# It makes me think I’m crazy
# Cause I thought that love was meant to be for two

# You’re up and down I’m so confused what do you want? oh woah
# The more I love you (boy the less I have you)
# Oh what oh what am I gonna do?
# I should face up, wake up get out while I can
# You don’t really give a damn
# Cause you’re taking, breaking everything I am
# And you don’t really give a damn
# The more I love you (boy the less I have you)
# Oh what oh what am I gonna do?
# The more I need you (boy the less I see you)

# Well there's a party for me,

# won't you tell me what to do,
# I can pretend you tell the truth
# I'm in your sweet sweet sweet embrace
# and you're a thousand miles away
# your arms a sweet sweet sweet embrace
# and you're a thousand miles away.
# Why...why...why...why...
# Should I take the blame, where's my big mistake
# should I feel happy for what I haven't done
# should I take the blame, should I feel the pain
# or should I feel regret for what I haven't done
# Why? Why? Why? Why?
# Was this a feast for me or just a bad surprise?
# Should I have expected this? I just don't wanna know

# And they're saying

# Hold back the time...just let it hang...
# stop the seconds, minutes, and hours
# and if I give you love...
# will you let me keep myself?
# I'm sitting out here on the very edge of earth
# looking through a book from long before the world began
# the man who gave it to me didn't have a name
# so overhead the sun is running down the day.
# The books begins it's story,
# it tells of war and hate and tells of power,
# the promises of freedom,
# and of all religions love and
# ways of life and how to...
# Close your time inside a flower
# stop the seconds, minutes, hours,
# close your time inside a flower
# live your life forget the power.
# The people passing by and they stop to look at me
# they all think I'm crazy 'cause I'm laughting in the wind
# but I'm free to be whatever I may choose
# to win this freedom I know that somebody had to lose.
# I've learned of those who buy love
# read about those willing to sell it
# when we're born it's for love
# some of us would die
# just to get it what you gotta do is...
# Close your time inside a flower
# stop the seconds, minutes, hours,
# close your time inside a flower
# live your life forget the power.
# We can give our love away and never lose ourselves
# but no one can be something that you own
# and if you think you've got the
# right to tell me what I am
# I got no trouble leaving you alone.
# Close your time inside a flower
# stop the seconds, minutes, hours,
# close your time inside a flower
# live your life forget the power.

# Cause I know there is more
# That love could be
# But you know that's not to say that I know just what I want out of
# life
# It doesn't mean that I feel hopeful everyday I'm alive
# But when you smiled at me I felt many things
# Like lust and fear and dreams
# And though it could hurt I've gotta try it anyway
# When the door is flung wide open you don't stay inside your room all
# day
# You go where there's a chance of losing the awful empty lie
# That it's better not to need anyone than to take the crazy uncertain
# ride
# And it's a new kiss and I'm flying out there
# A great kiss and I'm crying in the streets
# It's a killer kiss under a friendly rain
# Hear me now sell me joy and pain
# But at the best price you can
# I don't know much more than your first name
# But I might stick around till I know everything
# Because who we could be remains to be seen
# Is it the joke now or the dream
# And I like the new beginning the slow show and tell
# Sometimes I think the expectation is sweeter than the love itself
# It's alright I'm gonna take my time I'm gonna take your mistery
# You know it's simple don't you try to ignore take your freedom when
# you're given the key
# Like a new kiss and I'm flying out there
# A great kiss and I'm crying in the streets
# It's a killer kiss under a friendly rain
# Hear me now sell me joy and pain
# But at the best price you can
# Like a new kiss and I'm flying out there
# A great kiss and I'm crying in the streets

# don't you understand, I'm telling you
# who will ease your pain, who will love you all alone
# come out of the rain.
# And maybe there is something you can show me,
# maybe not
# and maybe your cold silence is the best thing that you've ever given me.
# Will you ever understand there's more than that you know.

# This is the marriage of silence and love
# here is the temple where I come to learn
# here are the eternal little things that I always loved
# here are all my tears just waiting for my return.
# This the marriage of silence and love
# this is the land of the gentle soul
# here sometimes I met the man who can see what I see
# live what I dream and be the way he seems.
# And I have no doubt, here I fall and rise
# here I can be poor and feel so rich inside
# here I come back to me, here I come back to see
# what he's doing now, what he's doing now.
# Oh, I believe in the marriage of silence and love
# and I still need some patience to grasp it all
# I hope I won't forget these feelings fading off in time
# trapped behind my face, burning in my mind.
# Oh, I have no doubt, here I become wise
# here I can be poor and feel rich inside
# here I come back to me, here I come back to see
# what he's doing now, what he's doing now.
# At first, I've lost my direction and I was just glad to be alive
# but then, I had to meet myself and my depression and I,
# I should have swallowed all my pride
# and I know it now, yes I know it now
# and I want to know him now, 'cause I want to love him now.
# Still I have no doubt, here I live for now
# here I can be poor and feel so rich inside
# here I come back to me, here I come back to see
# what he's doing now, what he's doing now.
# here I come back to me, here I come back to see
# what he's doing now, what he's doing now.
# and I want to know him now.

# I called you many times but you didn't answer the phone.

# You're moving so slowly, I hold my breath.
# Your and my body so close together,
# Oh, nothing will stop us besides our death.
# I'm losing control and so do you.
# Only rhythm and breathing and heat.

# Look at me,
# I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
# and I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
# I can't undestand
# I got misty just holding your hand
# Walk my way
# and a thousand violins begin to play
# or it might be the sound of your hello
# that music I hear,
# I get misty the moment you're near
# You can say that you're leading me on
# But it's just what I want you to do
# Don't you notice how hopeless I'm lost
# That's why I'm following you
# On my own, world I wander through
# This wonderland alone
# Never knowing
# My right foot from my left
# My hat from my glove,
# I'm too misty and too much in love

# Ella Fitzgerald's Lyrics to Frank Foster's composition, 'Shiny Stockings'
# As sung by Ella and played by the Count Basie Orchestra -
# Transcribed by Todd Loney, just for the love of Ella.
# Those silk shiny stockings that I wear when I'm with you,
# I wear cause you told me that you dig that crazy hue.
# Do we think of romance, when we go to a dance?
# Oh no! You take a glance - at those shiny stockings.
# Then came along some chick with great big stockings too.
# When you changed your mind about me, why I never knew.
# I guess I'll have to find, a new, a new kind,
# A guy who digs my shiny stockings too!
# (Half rest, then Basie piano lead - measured.)(Piano/reed section call and response.)
# (Basie piano/brass repeat call and response. Reeds join in. Crescendo, then diminuendo.)
# (Thad Jones muted trumpet lead- moderate soft.)(Muted trumpet/reeds call and response.)
# (Mued trumpet/brass repeat call and response. Reeds join. Crescendo.)
# (Explosive drum solo, half rest, and then big band explodes.)
# Shiny stockings! Shiny stocking.
# (Band jams! Then diminuendo.)
# Then came along some chick with great big stockings too.
# When you changed your mind about me, why I never knew.
# I guess I'll have to find, a new, a new kind,
# A guy who digs my shiny stockings too!
# A new guy who'll dig my shiny stockings too!

# Summertime and the living is easy
# Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
# Oh your daddy's rich and your ma is goodlooking
# So hush little baby don't you cry
# One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
# Then you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky
# But till that morning there's nothing can harm you
# With daddy and mummy standing by.

# Sorry is the hardest word And flowers don't say much
# Next time i'll find a man Who ain't got wanderlust
# You took me for a fool Don'n call it a mistake
# The roses may be real But baby you're just a fake
# I really thought we're the one Now I'm taking back all my love
# Bye bye baby I don't want you back Read my lip's it's time you got the facts
# Bye bye baby 'cos I'm better than that
# And now I've found out where you 're really at I don't want you back
# So now you're at my door With flower in your hand
# What part of goodbye Can't you understand
# I know you'd like to find me Crying over you
# I wouldn't waste my tears I'll find somebody true
# I really thought we had it all But now it's plain to see you're just a fool *
# And when you're sitting in your lonely room
# Remembering the way we used to be
# You'll be sorry you were such a fool
# I'm going to find someone whose love is just for me
# Don't want you back Don't want you back I don't want you back *

# I met a girl
# Snowball in hell
# She's as hard
# And as cracked as a liberty bell
# And I got her to
# Come on and move in with me
# And I said I'll find a better place
# Where we can spend eternity
# Don't go down
# Don't go down
# Stay with me, baby stay
# Her mother called me a thief
# And her dad
# Was a total commander and chief
# I fall in love with my love
# But I knew the kind of worthlessness we have to raise above
# Don't go down
# Don't go down
# Stay with me, baby stay
# Don't go down
# Don't go down
# Stay with me, baby stay
# She had a dream
# Woke up in shock
# She had seen
# Her own body outlined in chalk
# No fingerprints were found on the gun
# And her ghost leaned down to kiss me
# With a message from the sun
# Don't go down
# Don't go down
# Stay with me, baby stay
# Don't go down

# The big problem is the main attraction
# Dominoes are falling in a chain reaction
# The scraping subject ruled by fear told me
# Whiskey works better than beer
# The judge is on vinyl, decisions are final
# And nobody gets a reprieve
# And every wave is tidal - if you hang around
# You're going to get wet
# I can't prepare for death any more than I already have
# All you can do now is watch the shells
# The game looks easy that's why it sells
# Frustrated fireworks inside your head
# Are going to stand and deliver talk instead
# The method acting that pays my bills
# Keeps the fat man feeding in beverly hills
# I got a heavy metal mouth that hurls obscenity
# And I get my check from the trash treasury
# Cos I took my own insides out
# It don't matter cos I had no sex life
# All I want to do now is inject my ex wife
# I've seen the movie and I know what happens
# It's a Christmas time
# And the needles on the tree
# A skinny Santa is bringing something to me
# His voice is overwhelming, but his speech is slurred
# And I only understand every other word
# 'Open your parachute and grab your gun
# Falling down like an omen, a setting sun
# Read the part and we turn out fine
# It's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive
# But I don't care if I f*** up
# I'm going on a date with a rich white lady
# Ain't life great?
# Give me one good reason not to do it
# This is a place where time reverses
# Dead men talk to all the pretty nurses
# Instruments shine on a silver tray
# Don't let me be carried away
# Don't let me be carried away
# Don't let me be carried away
> Elliott Smith
# Here's the army
# That you mowed to the ground
# And the bodies you left lying around
# Talking it out
# The last hour
# I'm through trying now
# It's a big relief
# I'll be staying down
# Where no-one else gonna give me grief
# Mess me around
# Just make it over
# Your opinion was the law of the land
# A single thing that I couldn't always understand
# I lived it out from hour to hour
# The only thing that never really changed
# You ran me all around
# And dragged me down
# At the end of the day
# Don't keep me around
# Just make it over
# I've been thinking of the things that I missed
# Situations that I passed up for this
# One way love I took for ours
# I'm through trying now
# It's a big relief
# I'll be staying down
# I wasn't good at being a thief
# More like a clown
# Make it over
> Elliott Smith
# This is the place
# You'll end up when
# You lose the chase
# Where you're dragged against your will
# From a basement on the hill
# All anybody knows is
# You're not like them
# They hit you in the head
# And send you back to bed
# Isolation called you and passed a tunnel into a
# Bright world where you can rule a place of state
# Here's a little house for you to stay
# But everybody's scared of this place
# They're staying away
# Your little house on memory lane
# The mayor's name is fear
# His voice patrols the pier
# By a mountain up of cliche
# That advances everyday
# The doctor speak in clowns
# He rings out loud
# He'll keep the doors and windows shut
# And swear
# Never join a soul again
# But isolation chased you ‘til every muscle ached
# Down the only road it ever takes
# But everybody's scared of this place
# They're staying away
# Your little house on memory lane
# If it's your decision
# To be open about yourself
# Be careful or else
# Be careful or else
# Uncomfortable apart
# It's all written on my chart
# That I take what's given to me
# Most cooperatively
# I do what people say
# And lie in bed all day
# Absolutely horrified
# I hope you're satisfied
# Isolation pushes past something and chained to
# A place where suffering's a game
# But everybody's scared of this place
# They're staying away
# Your little house on memory lane
# Your little house on memory lane
> Elliott Smith
# I'll fake it through the day
# With some help from Johnny Walker Red
# Send the poison rain down the drain
# To put bad thoughts in my head
# Two tickets torn in half
# And a lot of nothin' to do
# Do you miss me, Miss Misery
# Like you say you do
# A man in the park
# Read the lines in my hand
# Told me I'm strong
# Hardly ever wrong I said
# "Man you mean--"
# You had plans for both of us
# That involved a trip out of town
# To a place I've seen in a magazine
# That you'd left lyin' around
# I don't have you with me
# But I keep a good attitude
# Do you miss me, Miss Misery
# Like you say you do
# I know you'd rather see me gone
# Than to see me the way that I am
# But I am in your life any way
# Next door the T.V.'s flashing
# Blue frames on the wall
# It's a comedy of errors you see
# It's about taking a fall
# To vanish into oblivion
# It's easy to do
# And I tried to leave but you know me
# I come back when you want me to.
# Do you miss me, Miss Misery
# Like you say you do
> Elliott Smith
# We arrived too late
# Our mouths were opening
# I turned off the light
# So come on night
# You're a witness you
# You've seen me interrupt
# A good old fashioned fight
# So come on night
# Everyone is gone
# Home to oblivion
# Home to oblivion
# Home to oblivion
# Watched the dying day
# Blushing in the sky
# Everyone is uptight
# So come on night
# Everyone is gone
# Home to oblivion
# Home to oblivion
# Home to oblivion
# I know we're not
# Illegitimate
# In our hearing
# So come on
# So come on night

# I'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl
# who's still around the morning after
# we broke up a month ago and I grew up I didn't know
# I'd be around the morning after
# it's always been wait and see
# a happy day and then you pay
# and feel like shit the morning after
# but now I feel changed around and instead falling down
# I'm standing up the morning after
# situations get fucked up and turned around sooner or later
# and I could be another fool or an exception to the rule
# you tell me the morning after
# crooked spin can't come to rest
# I'm damaged bad at best
# she'll decide what she wants
# I'll probably be the last to know
# no one says until it shows and you see how it is
# they want you or they don't
# say yes
# I'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl
# who's still around the morning after
> Elliott Smith
# Haven't laughed this hard in a long time
# I better stop now before I start crying
# Go off to sleep in the sunshine
# I don't want to see the day when it's dying
# She's a sight to see, she's good to me
# I'm already somebody's baby
# She's a pretty thing and she knows everything
# But I'm already somebody's baby
# You don't deserve to be lonely
# But those drugs you got won't make you feel better
# Pretty soon you'll find it's the only
# Little part of your life you're keeping together
# I'm nice to you, I could make it through
# That you're already somebody's baby
# I could make you smile if you stayed a while
# But how long will you stay with me baby
# Because your candle burns too bright
# Well, I almost forgot it was twilight
# Even if I think that you are right
# Well, I'm tired of being down, I got no fight
# You're wonderful, when it's beautiful
# But I'm already somebody's baby
# And if I went with you I'd disappoint you too
# Well, I'm already somebody's baby
# Already somebody's baby

# I can hound you if I need to
# Sip your brandy from a crystal shoe
# In the corner, in the corner
# While the others climb reaching dizzy heights
# The world's in front of me in black and white
# I'm on the bottom line, I'm on the bottom line
# I'd have a cardiac if I had such luck
# Lucky losers, lucky losers landing on skid row
# Landing on skid row
# While the Diamond Jims
# And the Kings road pimps
# Breath heavy in their brand new clothes
# I'm on the bottom line, I'm on the bottom line
# And I gotta get a meal ticket
# To survive you need a meal ticket
# To stay alive you need a meal ticket
# Feel no pain, no pain
# No regret, no regret
# When the line's been signed
# You're someone else
# Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest
# Shake a hand if you have to
# Trust in us and we will love you anyway, anyway

# It's so strange he doesn't show me

# I don't know why
# I just know I do
# I just can't explain
# In this language that I use
# Something leaves me speechless
# Each time that you approach
# Each time you glide right through me
# As if I was a ghost
# If I only could tell you
# If you only would listen
# I've got a line or two to use on you
# I've got a romance we could christen
# And there's a word in Spanish I don't understand
# But I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man
# He said it with devotion, he sounded so sincere
# And the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tears
# A word in Spanish, a word in Spanish
# If you can't comprehend
# Read it in my eyes
# If you don't understand it's love
# In a thin disguise
# And what it takes to move you
# Each time that you resist
# Is more than just a pretty face
# To prove that I exist
# When manners make no difference
# And my gifts all lay undone
# I trade my accent in on chance
# And fall back on a foreign tongue
> Elton John
# Abide with me, fast forth the eventide
# The darkness deepens, Lord abide with me
# When other helpers fail and comforts flee
# Help of the helpless, O abide with me
# I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless
# Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness
# Where is death's sting, where, grave, that victory
# I triumph still if Thou abide with me
# Hold Thou thy cross before my closed eyes
# Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
# Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee
# In life, in death, O Lord abide with me
# In life, in death, O Lord abide with me

# This ain't no battle honey, this ain't no fight
# How come you take it so hard when I stay out all night
# If I take a drink, is that against the law
# And if I have a good time, do you call that an act of war
# Well you better believe it boy, this house is your home
# I didn't build it up for you to live here on my own
# And if you think it's easy to forget about me
# You'd better think twice, you'd better believe it's an act of war
# We're living on the front line you and me
# Fighting on this battleground of misery
# Oh go ahead bring on your artillery
# And we'll make this an act of war
# Give it all you've got `cause I'm all dug in
# Keep the punches coming I can take them on the chin
# Winner takes all, let the best man win
# And we call it an act of war
# Well I'm a man of convenience I work a long hard day
# After twelve long hours ain't I got the right to play
# If living together is getting in the way
# Then I call that an act of war
# Well if that's your game then honey two can play
# I'm going on the town tonight and have some fun my way
# Ain't no way baby this girl's gonna stay
# I call it, I call it an act of war
# And it looks like time ain't been on our side
# If we could turn the clock back
# We might survive this act of war

# Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
# Ain't nothing like the real thing
# Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
# Ain't nothing like the real thing
# I got your picture hanging on my wall
# But it can't seem to come to me
# When I call your name
# I realized it's just a picture in a frame
# I read your letters but you're not here
# They don't move me, they don't groove me
# Like when I hear
# Your sweet voice whispering in my ear
# I play my games of fantasy
# I pretend I don't see reality
# I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me
# I got some memories to look back on
# Though they help me when you're gone
# I'm well aware
# Nothing can take the place of you being there
# No other sound is quite the same as your name
# No touch can do half as much
# To make me feel better
# Let's stay together
# I'm so
# So glad we got the real thing, baby
# So glad we got the real thing
# Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
# Ain't nothing like the real thing

# Raised to be a lady,
# by the golden rule;
# Alice was the spawn,
# of a public school.
# With a double-barrel'd name,
# in the back of her brain;
# and a simple case of "Mummy doesn't love me blues."
# Reality it seemed,
# was just a dream;
# she couldn't get it on,
# with the boys on the scene;
# but what do you expect,
# from a chick who's just sixteen;
# but hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey),
# you know what I mean.
# Chorus:
# All of the young girls love Alice,
# "Tender young Alice," they say;
# come over and see me,
# come over and please me.
# Alice, it's my turn today.
# All of the young girls love Alice,
# "Tender young Alice," they say;
# if I give you my number,
# will you promise to call me?
# Wait 'till my husband's away.
# Poor little darlin',
# with a chip out of her heart;
# it's like actin' in a movie,
# when you've got the wrong part;
# and getting your kicks,
# in another girl's bed;
# and it was only last Tuesday,
# they found you in the subway dead.
# And who could you call your friends down in Soho?
# One or two middle aged dykes in the A-Go-Go.
# But what do you expect, from a sixteen year old yo-yo;
# and hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey)
# oh, don't you know?
# Chorus
> Elton John
# Breaking down never seems to be that hard
# Falling short is always in the cards
# I'm on the road, sunrise is at my back
# Lost it all somewhere between the cracks
# I always hoped that I'd do better
# That I'd come out on top for once
# We all get what we deliver
# Then there are the lucky ones
# And I've got all that I'm allowed
# It'll do for me, I'm thankful now
# The walls get higher every day
# The barriers get in the way
# But I see hope in every cloud
# And I'm thankful, thankful
# I'm thankful, So thankful
# I'm thankful, I've got all that I'm allowed
# Leaving town gets to feel just like a job
# My desire never winds up on top
# I can say now I didn't want the moon
# It's out of reach somewhere beyond this room
# I always hoped that I'd do better
# That I'd come out on top for once
# We all get what we're delivered
# Then there are the lucky ones
# And I've got all that I'm allowed
# It'll do for me, I'm thankful now
# The walls get higher every day
# The barriers get in the way
# But I see hope in every cloud
# And I'm thankful, thankful
# I'm thankful, so thankful
# I'm thankful, I've got all that I'm allowed
# I always try to make things clear
# Then I watched as progress starts
# I only hope I'm standing here
# When heaven finally comes to call
> Elton John
# You're a cool little one
# My dark southern breeze
# Sweeps through my fingers
# And it amazes me
# Dixie shadowland
# Your envy shelters me
# Lay down your burden
# Mystery of ebony
# And it amazes me
# Oh it amazes me
# Maybe the heat babe could be this tune
# It amazes me
# It amazes me
# What drives me crazy is that big fat yellow moon
# Look up that pale light
# Well she's waking the trees
# I'm drifting in your hoodoo
# And it amazes me
# That magnolia state
# Got a hold on me
# I got no blues to preach
# Just Mississippi company
# Ain't no magic potion
# No gri-gri on her side
# She's bound to my salvation
# Sweet little mama
# Take me down by the river tonight
# And it amazes me
> Elton John
# Seen him playing in his backyard
# Young boy just starting out
# So much history in this landscape
# So much confusion, so much doubt
# Been there drinking on that front porch
# Angry kids, mean and dumb
# Looks like a painting, that blue skyline
# God hates fags where we come from
# 'Western skies' don't make it right
# 'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
# I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
# Left to die on a high ridge fence
# It's a cold, cold wind
# It's a cold, cold wind
# It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming
# See two coyotes run down a deer
# Hate what we don't understand
# You pioneers give us your children
# But it's your blood that stains their hands
# Somewhere that road forks up ahead
# To ignorance and innocence
# Three lives drift on different winds
# Two lives ruined, one life spent
> Elton John

# Lyrics by Tim Rice
# I'm sorry for everything I've said
# And for anything I forgot to say too
# When things get so complicated
# I stumble, at best, muddle through
# I wish that our lives could be simple
# I don't want the world, only you
# I wish I could tell you this face to face
# But there's never the time, never the place
# So this letter will have to do
# I love you

# Lately I've been thinking how much I miss my lady
# Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak
# Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
# Rolling through the hay like a puppy child
# And when it rains the rain falls down
# Washing out the cattle town
# And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
# And she dreams of crystal streams
# Of days gone by when we would lean
# Laughing fit to burst upon each other
# I can see you sitting eating apples in the evening
# The fruit juice flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
# Down the bronze of your body
# Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
# Rolling through the hay like a puppy child
# Oh if only I could nestle in the cradle of your cabin
# My arms around your shoulders the windows wide and open
# While the swallow and the sycamore are playing in the valley
# Oh I miss you Amoreena like a king bee misses honey
# Lately I've been thinking how much I miss my lady
# Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak
# Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
# Rolling through the hay like a puppy child
> Elton John
# Tread on my face if you like little lady
# Turn me inside out if you have to baby
# But don't you cross me off your list
# I am young and I ain't never been kissed
# Never been kissed by a lady called Amy
# You're far out, you're fab and insane
# A woman of the world, it's quite plain
# My dad told me Amy's your name
# Said he'd break my neck if I played your game
# But he can bust my neck `cause I love you all the same
# Amy I know you don't have to show your affection
# `Cause the big boys like you and to you I'm an infection
# So if you don't want me around
# I think I'll run along and drown
# You can't want this bum in town Amy
# I'm beaten on the streets `cause I loves you
# I watch you go to work in the summer
# I don't whistle at you down the street
# I would if I could but I can't whistle you see
# Amy I may not be James Dean
# Amy I may not be nineteen
# And I may still be in romper boots and jeans
# But Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams

# Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
# I came down here just to waste some time
# To get a little rest and to ease my mind
# I didn't calculate it when I walked in the door
# I only thought I'd stay for a minute or more
# First I saw the lights on the ceiling dim
# The stale perfume yeah, and ???
# My first impression was to get outside
# But then I saw you crying, crying by the fireside
# The pendulum swings
# Going to and fro
# And the clock goes round
# Says it's time to go
# And the clock goes round
# And the hours fly past
# Slow down pendulum you're moving much too fast
# Now it's gone kind of quiet but I seem to see
# That the only people here in the room are you and me
# But I don't mind girl, girl that's all right
# As long as you're gonna be with me, gonna be with me all night
> Elton John
# Music by Elton John
# Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
# The angel tree has grown so high
# And its roots are planted deep
# Never climb that willow
# 'Cause its trunk is awful steep
# Yeah the trunk is awful steep
# Seven miles south of the city
# Way on a windy hill
# The whistling branches of the angel tree
# Are calm at the evening still
# Magical ???
# As the leaves are ???
# And strange things happen to people
# Who go on to the windy hill
# ??? down here
# Had gone up to there
# And rested underneath her bough
# They slept long, what is wrong
# They never woke up again
> Elton John
# (Elton John/Taupin)
# Well they say that it's a fact
# If you watch the sky at night
# And if you stare into the darkness
# You might see celestial light
# And if your heart is empty
# And there's no hope in sight
# There's a chance you'll find an answer in the sky
# Well they say that it's a shame
# If you have nothing to believe
# And if you can't hold onto something
# You might as well die where you sleep
# You don't need a prayer
# And there's no price to ask why
# Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky
# And it's all so much bigger than it seems
# And it all overwhelms us now and then
# And I'm banking on a chance we believe
# That good can still control the hearts of men
# Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky
# And it's all so much bigger than it seems
# And it all overwhelms us now and then
# And I'm banking on a chance that we believe
# That good can still control the hearts of men
# This life's a long old road
# We shouldn't have to walk alone
# But if you find the right companion
# You won't feel so worn out when you've grown
# All life is precious
# And everyday's a prize
# And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky
# All life is precious
# And everyday's a prize
# And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky
# And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky
# And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

# Time goes by, it seems so long
# But it was only days ago when things were going wrong
# What happened to the love, to the love we knew
# The days we shared were so short and so few
# And baby I miss you
# Baby I miss you
# Remember when it didn't rain
# Will I ever see the sun again
# And baby I miss you
# Baby I miss you
# And I only wish that I could share your love again
# I thought about leaving for some new place
# Somewhere where I, I don't have to see your face
# 'Cause seeing your face only brings me out in tears
# Thinking of the love I've wasted all through the years
> Elton John
# It seems as though I've lived my life
# On the bad side of the moon
# To stir your dregs in sickness still
# Without the rustic spoon
# Common people live with me
# Where the light has never shone
# And the hermits flock like hummingbirds
# To speak in a foreign tongue
# I'm a light world away
# From the people who make me stay
# Sitting on the bad side of the moon
# There ain't no need for watchdogs here
# To justify our ways
# We live our life in manacles
# The main cause of our stay
# Exiled here from other worlds
# My sentence comes too soon
# Why should I be made to pay
# On the bad side of the moon
> Elton John
# I pulled out my Stage Coach Times
# And I read the latest news
# I tapped my feet in dumb surprise
# And of course I saw they knew
# The Pinkertons pulled out my bags
# And asked me for my name
# I stuttered out my answer
# And hung my head in shame
# Now they've found me
# At last they've found me
# It's hard to run
# From a starving family
# Now they've found me
# Well I won't run
# I'm tired of hearing
# There goes a well-known gun
# Now I've seen this chain gang
# Lord I say let me see my priest
# I couldn't have faced your desert sand
# Old burning brown backed beast
# The poor house they hit me for my kin
# And claimed my crumbling walls
# Now I know how Reno felt
# When he ran from the law
# Now they've found me
# At last they've found me
# It's hard to run
# From a starving family
# Now they've found me
# Well I won't run
# I'm tired of hearing
# There goes a well-known gun
# Now they've found me
# Lord I say at last they've found me
# It's hard to run
# From a starving family
# Lord I say now they've found me
# Well I won't run
# I'm tired of hearing
# There goes a well-known gun
# Lord I say now they've found me
# At last they've found me
# It's hard to run
# From a starving family
# Now they've found me
# I won't run
# I'm tired of hearing
# There goes a well-known gun

# Deep inside my soul fights a war
# I can't explain, I can't cross over any more
# All I see are dirty faces
# Rain and wire, and common sense in pieces
# But I try to see through Irish eyes
# Belfast
# Look outside, summer's lost and gone
# It's a long walk on a street of right and wrong
# In every inch of sadness
# Rocks and tanks go hand in hand with madness
# But I never saw a braver place
# Belfast
# And it's sad when they sing, and hollow ears listen
# Of smoking black roses, on the streets of Belfast
# And so say your lovers from under the flowers
# Every foot of this world needs an inch of Belfast
# Who's to say on whom heaven smiles
# Our different ways we try hard to recognise
# No more enchanted evenings
# The pubs are closed and all the ghosts are leaving
# But you'll never let them shut you down
# Belfast
# The enemy is not at home
# A jealous green streaks down this faulty diamond
# No bloody boots or crucifix
# Can ever hope to split this emerald island
# But I never saw a braver face
# Belfast
> Elton John
# I believe in love
# It's all we've got
# Love has no boundaries
# Costs nothing to touch
# War makes money
# Cancer sleeps
# curled up in my father
# And that means something to me
# Churches and dictators
# Politics and papers
# Everything crumbles
# sooner or later
# But love
# I believe in love
# It's all we've got
# Love has no boundaries
# No borders to cross
# Love is simple
# hate breeds
# Those who think difference
# is the child of disease
# fathers and son
# make love and guns
# families together
# kill someone
# without love
# Without love
# I wouldn't believe
# in anything
# that lives and breathes
# Without love
# I'd have no anger
# I wouldn't believe
# in the right to stand here
# Without love
# I wouldn't believe
# I couldn't believe in you
# and I wouldn't believe in me
# Without love
# I believe in love
# I believe in love
# I believe in love
> Elton John
# Hey kids, shake it loose together
# The spotlight's hitting something
# That's been known to change the weather
# We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
# So stick around
# You're gonna hear electric music
# Solid walls of sound
# Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
# But they're so spaced out, Bennie and the Jets
# Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
# Oh Bennie she's really keen
# She's got electric boots a mohair suit
# You know I read it in a magazine
# Bennie and the Jets
# Hey kids, plug into the faithless
# Maybe they're blinded
# But Bennie makes them ageless
# We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
# Where we fight our parents out in the streets
# To find who's right and who's wrong
> Elton John
# There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on
# And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
# Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
# Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
# As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
# The wind blows away all of yesterday's news
# Well they've locked up their daughters and they battened the hatches
# They always could find us but they never could catch us
# Through the grease streaked windows of an all night cafe
# We watched the arrested get taken away
# And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
# As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street
# 'Cause the steams in the boiler the coals in the fire
# If you ask how I am then I'll just say inspired
# If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
# Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died
> Elton John
# Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor
# And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure
# He had a thing about a quarter to four
# And he just couldn't handle any more
# He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper
# He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours
# So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him
# And you took him down to the fairground after some action
# And by around about a quarter to six
# You found a different way to get your kicks
# Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks
# Big dipper
# Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks
# He hadn't been too keen at the start
# Now he seems to have a change of heart
# He's got his own big dipper
# Only now he's not so sure, big dipper
# He's got his own big dipper
# But there's always room for more
# Everybody's got a song to sing
# Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper
# And at around about a quarter to ten
# You got up and did it all again
# He's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for
# Big dipper
# He's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours
# Another ride, another tune
# Another crazy afternoon
# Another reason for squeezing your big dipper
> Elton John

# Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
# Oh I've been staying up nights
# Thinking about a long flight that could take me home
# Or a slow train rolling
# Or a big boat floating out there on that lonely ocean
# I'm not the man I was
# I guess the dark side lost and the sun broke through
# I thought I knew it all
# I was the next big thing until I thought about you
# Oh I was reaching for the stars
# When I wasn't even touching you
# I was lying to myself, I needed no one's help
# thought I was living proof
# When there's one set of footsteps
# No one's gonna fill your shoes
# Now I'm looking in the mirror
# At a big man in a little suit
# I'm a big man in a little suit
# It's tight on me, hard on you
# It's a short cut but it's a long way home
# When you think you can make it on you own
# You think you're bulletproof
# But what you really are
# Is a big man in a little suit
# I was part of the chain
# A face with no name in a place with no soul
# By a thief in the night
# I was robbed of the light and left nothing, nothing to hold
# I've turned my back on a world like that
# I want to get back to loving you
# Give me one more chance
# Won't you warm the hands of this cold headed fool
> Elton John
# Music by Elton John
# Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
# Nothing looks as bad
# After staying up all night
# And the cruel words that cut you down
# I never meant to write
# And what came out as anger
# Oh was a lack of self control
# Billy won't you hold me
# Once before you go
# Clever lies keep coming
# Some men never change
# I'm a hand that's raised in anger
# The blow that causes pain
# But I just can't be trusted
# with a bottle and a child
# Billy it's no wonder
# You say I've never tried
# Oh so leave me now
# Oh don't turn around
# It's the best thing you ever did
# But it's hard for me to say goodbye
# To Billy and the kids
> Elton John
# There's some things I don't have now
# Some things I don't talk about
# These things are between myself and I
# In my thick skull the joker hides
# There's consequences I'm scared to taste
# Cold hard truths I can't face
# These days are different than the past
# Reflections change in the looking glass
# And everywhere I look there's something to learn
# A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
# A hatful of quarters and a naked song
# Don't answer the question of where we belong
# How come birds
# Don't fall from the sky when they die?
# How come birds
# Always look for a quiet place to hide
# These words
# Can't explain what I feel inside?
# Like birds I need a quiet place to hide
# These independent moves I make
# This confidence I try to fake
# You can hear the beating of my heart
# But not a feather falling in the dark
# And everything I hear never makes any sense
# Another old prophet perched on the fence
# A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
# Don't answer the question of what I am to you
> Elton John
# I'm going on the circuit, I'm doing all the clubs
# And I really need a song boys to stir those workers up
# And get their wives to sing it with me just like in the pubs
# When I worked the good old pubs in Stepney
# Oh could you knock a line or two together for a friend
# Sentimental tear inducing with a happy end
# And we need a tune to open our season at Southend
# Can you help us
# It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
# So much to prove, so few to tell you why
# Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
# At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
# It seems to me a change is really needed
# I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das
# No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
# Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars
# I like the warm blue flame, the hazy heat it brings
# It loosens up the muscles and forces you to sing
# You know it's just another hit and run from the tin pan alley twins
# And there's a chance that one day you might write a standard lads
# So churn them out quick and fast and we'll still pat your backs
# 'Cause we need what we can get to launch another dozen acts
# Are you working
> Elton John
# Hey you, you're a child in my head
# You haven't walked yet
# Your first words have yet to be said
# But I swear you'll be blessed
# I know you're still just a dream
# your eyes might be green
# Or the bluest that I've ever seen
# Anyway you'll be blessed
# And you, you'll be blessed
# You'll have the best
# I promise you that
# I'll pick a star from the sky
# Pull your name from a hat
# I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
# You'll be blessed
# I need you before I'm too old
# To have and to hold
# To walk with you and watch you grow
# And know that you're blessed
> Elton John
# Your old man got mad when I told him we were leaving
# He cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling
# He called you his child, said honey get wise to his game
# He'll get you in trouble, I know it, those bums are all the same
# There's a Greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
# So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus
# And it's all over now
# Don't you worry no more
# Gonna go west to the sea
# The Greyhound is swaying
# And the radio's playing
# Some blues for baby and me
# And the highway looks like it never did
# Lord, it looks so sweet and so free
# And I can't forget that trip to the west
# Singing blues for baby and me
# Saw your hands trembling, your eyes opened in surprise
# It's ninety in the shade, babe, and there ain't a cloud in the sky
# I called you my child, said honey, now this is our game
# There's two of us to play it and I'm happy to be home again
# There's a Greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
# So tell him Goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus
# Repeat Chorus
> Elton John
# Crime in the streets
# I read about it everyday in the papers
# Justice needs and justice wants
# But just in times, yes, too late here
# Feels like I wasn't born there
# I feel just like a Boogie Pilgrim
# Boogie Pilgrim
# Hustled to get it
# To get it together
# Down on the jive talk
# Down on the weather
# Boogie Pilgrim
# Brother I never felt better
# No, I never felt better
# Low life's complete
# When you've lived that way out on the sidewalk
# (Walking on the sidewalk everyday)
# I got the speed if you got the need
# But the need in me needs nothing
# (But you know that I need nothing)
# But I know that you all want something
# Just like Boogie Pilgrim
> Elton John
# Holy Moses I have been removed
# I have seen the specter he has been here too
# Distant cousin from down the line
# Brand of people who ain't my kind
# Holy Moses I have been removed
# Holy Moses I have been deceived
# Now the wind has changed direction and I'll have to leave
# Won't you please excuse my frankness but it's not my cup of tea
# Holy Moses I have been deceived
# I'm going back to the border
# Where my affairs, my affairs ain't abused
# I can't take any more bad water
# I've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes
# Holy Moses I have been deceived
# Holy Moses let us live in peace
# Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
# There's a man over there what's his color I don't care
# He's my brother let us live in peace
# He's my brother let us live in peace
# He's my brother let us live in peace
> Elton John
# I recall how it used to be
# In my younger days
# I built a wall all around my heart
# To keep the pain away
# I built it tall and I built it wide
# I left no room for doubt
# Your love still found its way inside
# And couldn't get back out
# I'm breaking down the barriers
# Making up my mind
# I'm breaking down the barriers of time
# I'm taking down the barriers
# And loving what I find
# I'm breaking down the barriers that lie
# Between your love and mine
# I guess you know you were not the first
# You may not be the last
# But you have shown me a better way
# And now I'm learning fast
# You gotta go where the feeling flows
# I take it while it's hot
# You gotta give if you wanna get
# And I want all you got
> Elton John
# You tell me there's an angel in your tree
# Did he say he'd come to call on me
# For things are getting desperate in our home
# Living in the parish of the restless folks I know
# Everybody now bring your family down to the riverside
# Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
# Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
# It's time we put the flame torch to their keep
# Burn down the mission
# If we're gonna stay alive
# Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
# See the red flame light the sky
# Burn down the mission
# Burn it down to stay alive
# It's our only chance of living
# Take all you need to live inside
# Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
# My wife cried when they came to take me away
# But what more could I do just to keep her warm
# Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls
> Elton John
# Written by George and Ira Gershwin
# from Four Weddings and a Funeral soundtrack
# They're writing songs of love, but not for me
# A lucky star's above, but not for me
# With love to lead the way, I've found more clouds are grey
# Than any Russian play could guarantee
# I was a fool to fall and get that way
# Heigh ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
# Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
# I guess she's not for me
# It all began so well, but what an end
# This is the time a feller needs a friend
# When every happy plot ends with a marriage knot
# And there's no knot for me
> Elton John
# Sober in the morning light
# Things look so much different
# To how they looked last night
# A pale face pressed to an unmade bed
# Like flags of many nations flying high above her head
# The cellophane still on the flowers
# The telegram still in her hand
# As whispers circulate all day
# Their back-stage baby princess passed away
# And you can cage the songbird
# But you can't make her sing
# And you can trap the free bird
# But you'll have to clip her wings
# 'Cause she'll soar like a hawk when she flies
# But she'll dive like an eagle when she dies
# Promises of no more lies
# Fell flat upon an empty stage
# Before the audience arrived
# A return in time to the cheaper seats
# She never knew what lay beneath
# Just a dated handbill they found between the sheets
# Let down before the final curtain
# A shallow heart that left her cold
# She left in rouge upon the mirror
# A circled kiss to the faithful who'd miss her
> Elton John

# There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
# When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
# An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
# It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you
# And can you feel the love tonight
# It is where we are
# It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
# That we got this far
# And can you feel the love tonight
# How it's laid to rest
# It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
# Believe the very best
# There's a time for everyone if they only learn
# That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
# There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
# When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

# Goodbye Norma Jean
# Though I never knew you at all
# You had the grace to hold yourself
# While those around you crawled,
# They crawled out of the woodwork,
# And they whispered into your brain,
# They set you on the treadmill
# And they made you change your name.
# And it seems to me that you lived your life
# Like a candle in the wind,
# Never knowing who to cling to
# When the rain set in.
# And I would have liked to have known you
# But I was just a kid.
# Your candle burned out before
# Your legend ever did.
# Loneliness wa tough,
# The toughest role you ever played.
# Hollywood created a superstar
# And pain was the price you paid,
# Even when you died
# The pres still hounded you
# All that papers had to say
# Was that Marilyn was found in the nude.
# Goodbye Norma Jean
# Though I never you at all
# You had the grace to hold yourself
# While those around you crawled.
# Goodbye Norma Jean,
# From the young man in the 22nd row
# Who sees you as something more than sexual,
# Something more than just our Marilyn Monroe.

# I can't keep this from you
# I've held it in so long
# It's time to tell the truth
# Keeping it from you is wrong
# I can't keep this from you
# It's so simple I'm afraid
# When I tell you how I feel
# You'll just laugh and call me crazy
# And I can't keep
# This love a secret
# And I don't want
# To go on longing
# I just want a chance for me to prove
# My love and I can't keep this from you
# I can't keep this from you
# It's hard to breathe in here

# My love and I can't keep this from you
# And I love every move you make

# Captain Fantastic raised and regimented, hardly a hero
# Just someone his mother might know
# Very clearly a case for corn flakes and classics
# "Two teas both with sugar please"
# In the back of an alley
# While little Dirt Cowboys turned brown in their saddles
# Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
# For it's hay make and "Hey mom, do the papers say anything good.
# Are there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys
# Should I make my way out of my home in the woods"
# Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
# City slick Captain
# Fantastic the feedback
# The honey the hive could be holding
# For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
# Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
# And the sixty-eight summer festival wallflowers are thinning
# For cheap easy meals and hardly a home on the range
# Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
# We've thrown in the towel too many times
# Out for the count and when we're down
# Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
# From the end of the world to your town
# And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
# Couldn't fool us
# For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
# Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
# The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
# From here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb

# From the day we arrive on the planet
# And blinking, step into the sun
# There's more to be seen than can ever be seen
# More to do than can ever be done
# Some say eat or be eaten
# Some say live and let live
# But all are agreed as they join the stampede
# You should never take more than you give
# In the circle of life
# It's the wheel of fortune
# It's the leap of faith
# It's the band of hope
# Till we find our place
# On the path unwinding
# In the circle, the circle of life
# Some of us fall by the wayside
# And some of us soar to the stars
# And some of us sail through our troubles
# And some have to live with the scars
# There's far too much to take in here
# More to find than can ever be found
# But the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
# Keeps great and small on the endless round

# When the shades are drawn
# And the light of the moon is banned
# And the stars up above
# Walk the heavens hand in hand
# There's a shady place
# At the end of the working day
# Where young lovers go
# And this hot little trio plays
# That's where we meet
# That's where we meet
# Me and you rendezvous
# In the club at the end of the street
# Oooh where we meet
# Oooh where we meet
# Me and you rendezvous
# In the club at the end of the street
# From the alleyways
# Where the catwalks gently sway
# You hear the sound of Otis
# And the voice of Marvin Gaye
# In this smoky room
# There's a jukebox plays all night
# And we can dance real close
# Beneath the pulse of a neon light
# There's a downtown smell of cooking
# From the flame on an open grill
# There's a sax and a big bass pumping
# Lord have mercy
# You can't sit still
# You can't sit still
> Elton John
# We still sit at separate tables
# And we sleep at different times
# And the warm wind in the palm trees
# Hasn't helped to change our minds
# It was the lure of the tropics
# That I thought might heal the scars
# Of a love burned out by silence
# In a marriage minus heart
# And I call the kids on the telephone
# Say there's something wrong out here
# It's July but it's cold as Christmas
# In the middle of the year
# The temperature's up to ninety five
# But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes
# And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here
# So how come it's cold as Christmas in the middle of the year
# I dreamed of love in a better climate
# And for what it's really worth
# I put faith in the star we followed
# To this Caribbean surf
# But there's an icy fringe on everything
# And I cannot find the lines
# Where's the beauty in the beast we made
# Why the frost in the summertime
> Elton John
# In the quiet silent seconds I turned off the light switch
# And I came down to meet you in the half light the moon left
# While a cluster of night jars sang some songs out of tune
# A mantle of bright light shone down from a room
# Come down in time I still hear her say
# So clear in my ear like it was today
# Come down in time was the message she gave
# Come down in time and I'll meet you half way
# Well I don't know if I should have heard her as yet
# But a true love like hers is a hard love to get
# And I've walked most all the way and I ain't heard her call
# And I'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all
# Come down in time I still hear her say
# So clear in my ear like it was today
# Come down in time was the message she gave
# Come down in time and I'll meet you half way
# There are women and women and some hold you tight
# While some leave you counting the stars in the night
> Elton John
# Music by Elton John
# Lyrics by Gary Osborne
# The night we met, we stood
# Divided by defenses as old as time
# But love has found a way
# To bring me to your senses and you to mine
# So we meet in the cloak of evening
# And we try to go on believing
# Two different worlds can still be one
# You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun
# The night we met, we knew
# What love would soon be leading us to do
# And so it goes, and now
# When wanting turns to needing, I turn to you
# And it's hard to go on deceiving
# But we have to go on believing
# That someday our love will overcome
# You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun
# As I lie here and feel you breathing
# It's not hard to keep on believing
# That someday our love will overcome
# You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun

# When I was a little bitty baby
# My Momma done rocked me in the cradle
# In them old cottonfields back home
# It was back in Louisiana
# Just about a mile from Texarkana
# In them old cottonfields back home
# Let me tell you now well I got me in a mess
# I caught a nail in my tire doing lickety splits
# I had to walk a long long way to town
# Came along a nice old man
# Well he had a hammer
# Wait a minute mister, can you get me some direction
# I'm gonna wanna be right off for home
# Oh let them cotton balls get rotten
# I got you baby, who needs cotton
# In them old cottonfields back home
# Well it sure feels good to breathe the air back home
# You should have seen their faces when they seen how I'd grown
# In them old cotton fields back home
> Elton John
# Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
# Village children fight each other for a share
# And the 6:09 goes roaring past the creek
# Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week
# I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
# Well she's really going fine for eighty four
# Well she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
# Poor old girl she needs a hand to run the farm
# And it's good old country comfort in my bones
# Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
# Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
# Country comfort's in a truck that's going home
# Down at the well they've got a new machine
# The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
# Yeah but that ain't natural well so old Clay would say
# You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day
# Now the old fat goose is flying cross the sticks
# The hedgehog's done in clay between the bricks
# And the rocking chair's creaking on the porch
# Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch
> Elton John
# On a bench, on the beach
# Just before the sun had gone
# I tried to reach you
# Plain faced and falling fast
# You looked so vacant like an empty shell
# Whose life had passed upon the ocean
# Before light shook the sky
# Down by the docks I saw
# The masts unfolding
# Don't turn away, please understand
# It's a life and a living
# And a way to keep the wolves away
# From hungry hands, from hungry hands
# Crazy water
# Takes my fishing boat on Monday morning
# Dangerous dreaming
# If we all believe in the things you believe you're seeing
# Oh we'd never drop our nets in the crazy water, crazy water
# Tangled lives, lonely wives
# Shoreline widows pray
# For the souls of missing whalers
# Endless nights on an endless sea
# Where nothing lives between us
# Just the breakers on the ocean
# Separating you and me
# Separating you and me
> Elton John
# I remember when rock was young
# Me and Suzie had so much fun
# holding hands and skimming stones
# Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
# But the biggest kick I ever got
# was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
# While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock
# we were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock
# Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
# when your feet just can't keep still
# I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
# Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights
# when Suzie wore her dresses tight
# and the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight
# But the years went by and the rock just died
# Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
# Long nights crying by the record machine
# dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
# But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
# burning up to the Crocodile Rock
# Learning fast as the weeks went past
# we really thought the Crocodile Rock would last
> Elton John
# We're caught up in a web, you and I
# Since Crystal came between us
# The knots of friendship seem to be untied
# And it hurts me most to cheat and that's no lie
# She can swing us both forever
# In the long run she's the one who must decide
# And if she leaves me handle her with care
# Don't hurt little Crystal
# And if she calls you long distance just be there
# Oh Crystal
# The world is your oyster, you're a pearl
# But he's a jewel and my friend
# I'm sure that in the end, Crystal you'll be his little girl
# Oh Crystal
# You're stronger than me but I'm sure
# That the fight would fall to no one
# The cold hard truth is stronger than us all
# And it breaks my heart to see us go this far
# We're just captives in our separate cells
# And without her there's no peace behind these bars
> Elton John
# I used to know this old scarecrow
# He was my song, my joy and sorrow
# Cast alone between the furrows
# Of a field no longer sown by anyone
# I held a dandelion
# That said the time had come
# To leave upon the wind
# Not to return
# When summer burned the earth again
# Cultivate the freshest flower
# This garden ever grew
# Beneath these branches
# I once wrote such childish words for you
# But that's okay
# There's treasure children always seek to find
# And just like us
# You must have had
# A once upon a time
> Elton John
# Daniel is travelling tonight on a plane
# I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
# Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
# God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
# They say Spain is pretty though I've never been
# Well Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen
# Oh and he should know, he's been there enough
# Lord I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much
# Daniel my brother you are older than me
# Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal
# Your eyes have died but you see more than I
# Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky
# Daniel is travelling tonight on a plane
# I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
# Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
# God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
# Oh God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes

# Oh, I'm a dark diamond
# I've turned hard and cold
# Once was a jewel with fire in my soul
# There's two sides of a mirror
# One I couldn't break through
# Stayed trapped on the inside, wound up losing you
# Tell me how does it work
# How do you make things fit
# Spent all my life trying to get it right
# I've put it together and it falls apart
# I thought to myself I might understand
# But when the wall's built
# And the heart hardens
# You get a dark diamond
# Dark diamond
# Oh, I'm a dark diamond
# But you're something else
# You read me more than I read myself
# The one star I could count on
# Only comet I could trust
# You burnt through my life to the true meaning of love
> Elton John
# Dear God, are you there
# Can you hear me, do you care
# Dear God, here are we
# Less than perfect, far from free
# Oh we take what we get and we don't take no more
# But we sometimes forget what it was you created us for
# Dear God, now's the time
# If you're listening, show some sign
# Dear God, hear me plead
# Don't desert us in our need
# Dear God, lend a hand
# Is this really what you planned
# Dear God, in you we trust
# Though we've failed you, don't fail us
# Oh we take what we get but we can't take much more
# Do you sometimes forget what it was you created us for, dear God
# I hope and pray you'll lead us to a brighter day
# Out of the darkness and light up our way, dear God
# I hope and pray you'll lead us to a better way
# Love is the answer so light up our way, dear God
# Light up our way dear God, dear God
# Love is the answer so light up our way, dear God

# Sling your hook in with him baby
# He's a real sharp-shooter now
# If he's out there hiding in the tall grass
# Tell him I said he was a coward
# This ain't any old western honey
# It's the twentieth century now
# But if he thinks he's some kind of tough cowboy
# And he's hurt her then I want to know how
# Did he shoot her with his compromise
# Like a heart attack he can paralyse
# Or did he hang her in a noose
# On the telephone line
# Did he shoot her with a 45
# Did he leave his mark right between her eyes
# Oh did he shoot that girl
# That used to be mine
# Tell him I'm ready any time he chooses
# The pay-off for the things, for the things he's done
# He ain't messing with no two-bit bandit
# Armed with a couple of guns
# If he wants to see it as a two reel movie
# He's living in the head of someone else
# But better take him down and dust him honey
# I want to hear the truth for myself
# Did he shoot her
# Did he shoot her
> Elton John
# I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck
# I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck
# That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard
# But I'm gonna put buckshots in your pants if you step into my yard
# When I watch the police come by and move you on
# Well I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become
# Well you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear
# But all you got was a mop up job washing other people's stairs
# I'm gonna tell the world, you're a dirty little girl
# Someone grab that bitch by the ears
# Rub her down scrub her back
# And turn her inside out
# `Cause I bet she hasn't had a bath in years
# Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls
# That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl
# And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself
# So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped
> Elton John
# Showboat coming up the river
# See her lanterns flicker in the gentle breeze
# I can hear the crickets singing in the evening
# Old Dixie Lily moving past the cypress trees
# My little boat she rocks easy
# I've been catching catfish in the creek all day
# Oh and I've never seen ladies like those on the big boats
# Must be fancy breeding lets you live that way
# Dixie Lily, chugging like a grand old lady
# Paddles hitting home in the noonday sun
# Ploughing through the water with your whistles blowing
# Down from Louisiana on the Vicksburg run
# Papa says that I'm a dreamer
# Says them skeetas bit me one too many times
# Oh but I never get lonesome living on the river
# Watching old Lily leave the world behind
> Elton John
# Don't go breaking my heart
# I couldn't if I tried
# Honey if I get restless
# Baby you're not that kind
# Don't go breaking my heart
# You take the weight off me
# Honey when you knock on my door
# I gave you my key
# Nobody knows it
# When I was down
# I was your clown
# Nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
# Right from the start
# I gave you my heart
# I gave you my heart
# So don't go breaking my heart
# I won't go breaking your heart
# Don't go breaking my heart
# And nobody told us
# `Cause nobody showed us
# And now it's up to us babe
# I think we can make it
# So don't misunderstand me
# You put the light in my life
# You put the sparks to the flame
# I've got your heart in my sights
> Elton John
# I can't light no more of your darkness
# All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
# I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
# Frozen here on the ladder of my life
# Too late to save myself from falling
# I took a chance and changed your way of life
# But you misread my meaning when I met you
# Closed the door and left me blinded by the light
# Don't let the sun go down on me
# Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
# I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
# But losing everything is like the sun going down on me
# I can't find the right romantic line
# But see me once and see the way I feel
# Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
# But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal
> Elton John
# Look at you, could I have been so foolish and so green
# A face that smiled at every passing scene
# Look at you, you're lost behind the web of woven time
# When each emotion pinball in your mind
# Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
# I was the judge and jury at your trial
# Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
# Now I have the time to stand and learn
# But you and I have come so far
# With a shaken faith
# From the pain of a broken heart
# Toward feeling great
# Feel like life has just begun
# No more singing duets for one
# I hold your picture here beside the bed
# You had a party raging in your head
# Look at me, I look at you with vacancy and hurt
# And here today all I can do is learn
# Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
# I was the judge and jury at your trial
# Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
# Now I have the time to stand and learn
# I have this picture of me looking at you
# Looking at me
# And I would like to say
# Goodbye sweet memory
> Elton John
# I won't see you `till Christmas
# I breathe coal dust, I get blisters
# But the foreman he don't worry
# He say work boy there's no hurry
# Don't that big red sun
# Look a lot like fire
# When you come out of the ground
# After forty eight hours
# Going down down down down down
# Going down in Durban deep
# Going down down down down down
# There's no mercy in my sleep
# I just hear that drill and hammer
# I feel the killing heat
# Going two miles down to the heart
# Of Durban deep
# I was born on amen corner
# I pound rock face, I get lonely
# But my family they go hungry
# Sill the boss man he call us lazy
# Don't the old blue heaven
# Look a lot like your eyes
# When you're blinded by the brightness
# Of the Transvaal sky

# Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
# Released as a UK single in 1990
# Every time you turn around
# You wear another face
# Every time I look away
# I find a hiding place
# If you knew me like you knew him
# You would know just how I feel
# Slipping through someone's fingers
# Falling under someone's wheels
# It's easier to walk away
# Better off to face the facts
# When love holds you up for ransom
# Walk away and don't look back
# Never seen you looking back through
# Smiling eyes and tears
# Never knew you holding on to
# Memories and fears
# Just release me I can't take it
# Can't you see a change has come
# Strangled by infatuation
# Buried under someone's thumb
# It's easier to walk away
# Cover and fade to black
# When love scars and leaves you branded
# Walk away and don't look back
# Every time you turn around
# You wear another face
# Every time I look away
# I find a hiding place

# Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)
# Elton John
# (Elton John/Bernie Taupin)
# What happened here?
# As the New York sunset disappeared
# I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
# Who lived here?
# He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
# Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
# But now it all looks strange, it's funny how one insect
# Can damage so much grain
# Amd what's it for?
# This little empty garden by the brownstone door
# And in the cracks along the sidewalk, nothing grows no more
# Who lived here?
# He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
# Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
# And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
# A gardener like that one, no one can replace
# CHORUS:
# And I've been knocking but no one answers
# And I've been knocking most all the day
# Oh, and I've been calling Oh, 'hey hey johnny'
# Can't you come out to play
# And through their tears
# Some say he farmed his best in younger years
# But he'd have said that roots grow stronger if he could hear
# Who lived there
# He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
# Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
# Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
# We hear your name
# And I've been knocking but no one answers
# And I've been knocking most all the day
# Oh, and I've been calling Oh, 'hey hey johnny'
# Can't you come out to play
# Johnny can't you come out to play?
# Johnny in your empty garden

# From the soundtrack "The Road To El Dorado"
# Our glorious city
# Was build by the divinities by Gods
# Who saw fit to bestow
# The gift of a paradise
# Peaceful and harmonious upon
# Us mere mortals below
# And made El Dorado
# The magnificent and golden
# One thousand years ago
# El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
# But all this was granted
# For only one millennium
# I know my legacy is to fulfill
# My promise to all my people
# Who have trusted me, the Gods
# Will approve of us still
# Preserve El Dorado
# The magnificent and golden
# And I believe they will
# El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
# El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
# The mountains so high and waters deep
# Are her disguise
# Her secrets are safe from foreign hands
# And eyes forever
# Preserve El Dorado
# The magnificent and goldent
# And I believe they will
# El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado

# We all lead such elaborate lives
# Wild ambitions in our sights
# How an affair of the heart survives
# Days apart and hurried nights
# Seems quite unbelievable to me
# I don't want to live like that
# Seems quite unbelievable to me
# I don't want to love like that
# I just want our time to be slower and gentler, wiser, free
# We all live in extravagant times
# Playing games we can't all win
# Unintended emotional crimes
# Take some out, take others in
# I'm so tired of all we're going through
# I don't want to live like that
# I'm so tired of all we're going through
# I don't want to love like that
# I just want to be with you now and forever, peaceful, true
# I wish I had the courage
# To tell you face to face
# But I could wait forever
# For the perfect time and place
# We all live such elaborate lives
# We don't know whose words are true
# Strangers, lovers, husbands, wives
# Hard to know whose loving who
# Too many choices tear us apart
# I don't want to live like that
# Too many choices tear us apart
# I don't want to love like that
# I just want to touch your heart, may this confession be the start
> Elton John
# There's a fly in the window
# A dog in the yard
# And a year since I saw you
# There's a trunk in the corner
# I keep all my letters
# My bills and demands I keep too
# Well I can't help thinking
# About the times
# You were a wife of mine
# You aimed to please me
# Cooked black-eyed peas-me
# Made elderberry wine
# Drunk all the time
# Feeling fine on elderberry wine
# Those were the days
# We'd lay in the haze
# Forget depressive times
# How can I ever get it together
# Without a wife in line
# To pick the crop and get me hot
# On elderberry wine
# Round a tree in the summer
# A fire in the fall
# Flat out when they couldn't stand
# The bottle went round
# Like a woman down south
# Passed on from hand to hand
> Elton John
# I can't really explain it
# I haven't got the words
# It's a feeling that you can't control
# I suppose its like forgetting,
# losing who you are,
# And at the same time,
# something makes you whole,
# Its like that there's a music,
# playing in your ear,
# And I'm listening, and I'm listening
# and then I dissapear
# And then I feel a change
# Like a fire deep inside
# Something bursting me wide open
# Impossible to hide
# And suddenly im flying
# Flying like a bird
# Like electricity
# Electricity
# Sparks inside of me
# And i'm free, I'm free
# It's a bit like being angry,
# It's a bit like being scared,
# Confused and all mixed up,
# And mad as hell,
# It's like when you've been crying,
# And you're empty, and you're full,
# I don't know what it is,
# It's hard to tell,
# Its like that theres some music,
# playing in your ear,
# But the music,
# Is impossible,
# Impossible to hear,
# But then i feel it move me,
# Like a burning deep inside,
# Something bursting me wide open
# Impossible to hide
# Then suddenly im flying
# Flying like a bird
# Like electricity
# Electricity
# Sparks inside of me
# And i'm free, I'm free
# Electricity
# Sparks inside of me
# And i'm free, I'm free
# Ohhhh-oh-whoa.....
# I'm free
> Elton John
# Staring all alone
# And your grace and style
# Cut me to the bone
# With your razor blade smile
# I watched you playing pool
# It's all around the school that I love you
# I love your gypsy hair
# And dark brown eyes
# Always unprepared
# For your pointed replies
# Cynical and lean
# I lie awake and dream about you
# If you only knew
# What I'm going through
# Time and again I get ashamed
# To say your name
# It's hard to grin and bear
# When you're standing there
# My lips are dry
# I catch your eye and look away
# Sitting in my room
# I've got it bad
# Crying for the moon
# They think I'm mad
# They say it isn't real
# But I know what I feel and I love you
# But I would give my life
# For a single night beside you
> Elton John
# The church bells ring out morning glory
# When summer bends to the winter's rage
# Emily walks through the cemetery
# Passed a dog in an unmarked grave
# The old girl hobbles, nylons sagging
# Talks to her sisters in the ground
# I saw a lie in the mirror this morning
# I heard a prophesy all around
# And Emily they come and go
# The shadows and the distant sounds
# But Emily don't be afraid
# When the weight of angels weighs you down
# Emily prays to a faded hero
# In a little frame clutched to her gown
# Hears the voice of promise in his memory
# Tonight's the night they let the ladder down
# In a cage sits a gold canary
# By a wicker chair and a rosewood loom
# As a soul ascends abord the evening
# Canary sings to an empty room
# And Emily they come and go
# The shadows and the distant sounds
# But Emily don't be afraid
# When the weight of angels weighs you down

# A few more days and we'll be home in glory
# Already they'll be getting out the flags
# With Memphis high ??? dormitory
# For me, I only see a lot of snags
# The prospect above all I find distressful
# Is having to give up the soldier's life
# If anything I'm rather too successful
# They made me hand my sword in for a wife
# For just because I've triumphed as a slaver
# Brought booty back to Egypt by the ton
# Of this and every month, I'm now the flavor
# And scheduled to do things I've never done
# And why should I tell you this, a stranger I just met
# A woman who in hours from now I'll certainly forget
# Anonymous and undemanding
# Enchantment passing through
# My secrets and my confidence are safe enough with you
# My days out on the field are all but ended
# They'll put me out to grass which means the throne
# Bedecked and bejeweled alongside my intended
# I feel as though my heart is set in stone
# But maybe I am being far too gloomy
# Yes, maybe I'll make waves in pastures new
# Find government and politics come to me
# As naturally as I now talk to you
# For just because I've triumphed as a slaver
# Brought booty back to Egypt by the ton
# Of this and every month, I'm now the flavor
# And scheduled to do things I've never done
# And why should I tell you this, a stranger I just met
# A woman who in hours from now I'll certainly forget
# Anonymous and undemanding
# Enchantment passing through
# My secret lack of confidence is safe enough with you
# Why should I tell you this, a stranger I just met
# A woman who in hours from now I'll certainly forget
# Anonymous and undemanding
# Enchantment passing through
# My secret lack of confidence is safe enough with you
> Elton John
# How come you're so understanding
# When I tell you all my lies
# And pretending to believe them
# See through all my alibis
# And I need you more than ever
# And I want you till the end
# Chloe
# How you handle what you live through
# I can never hope to learn
# Taking all the pain I give you
# Loving blindly in return
# And I need you more than ever
# I will always be your friend
# Chloe
# Chloe
# Chloe, what you gonna do about me
# Chloe, what you gonna do
# What you gonna do about me
# You're the lifeline that I cling to
# When I feel like givin' in
# When the dreams that I rely on
# Start to wear a little thin
# Then I need you more than ever
# And I want you till the end
# Chloe
# Chloe
# Chloe, what you gonna do about me
# Chloe, what you gonna do
# What you gonna do about me
# Then I need you more than ever

# I read about how you're slow with the truth
# Like any old Aesop's Fable
# But when you're turtlesque, I'm a hare's breath
# Into payment under the table
# But some journalist got his mug shot kit
# And his briefcase on his lap
# But I'm tired of being linked with the K.G.B.
# And all that political crap
# `Cause I've seen your fascist faces
# On the cover of the national papers
# Staring out in black and white
# From the tall gray walls on the other side
# When I see your fascist faces
# Then I know I've had enough
# Trying to trace it or erase it
# Is it foolproof or a bluff
# If the boy had been blessed he'd have been arrested
# On a charge of wearing red shoes
# But if your pants are blue you got nothing to lose
# It'll make you a patriot through and through
> Elton John
# Don't close the shades
# I'm scared of the darkness
# I'm cold as a razor blade
# Inches from madness
# Don't let me sleep here
# They're all trying to kill me
# I've seen the walls moving
# They've all heard me screaming, screaming
# Feed me
# Feed my needs and then just leave me
# Let me go back where you found me
# `Cause I miss my basement
# The sweet smell of new paint
# The warmth and the comforts of home
# So feed me
# Give me my treatment and free me
# My arms are so hungry so feed me
# The room's so distorted
# And filled with mad shadows
# I feel like a carcass
# White like a marrow bone
# It all seems so long ago
# I remember them laughing
# I heard the ambulance scream
# I saw the red light flashing, flashing
> Elton John
# I was one as you were one
# And we were two so much in love forever
# I loved the white socks that you wore
# But you don't wear white socks no more, now you're a woman
# I joked about your turned-up nose
# And criticized your school girl clothes
# But would I then have paced these roads to love you
# For seasons come and seasons go
# Bring forth the rain the sun and snow
# Make Valerie a woman
# And Valerie is lonely
# No more to roam on the snow hills of Hienton
# Undecided with the guardians of the older generation
# A doormat was a sign of welcome
# In the winter months to come
# And in the summer laughing
# Through the castle ruins we'd run
# For the quadrangle sang to the sun
# And the grace of our feeling
# And the candle burned low as we talked of the future
# Underneath the ceiling
# There were tears in the sky
# And the clouds in your eyes were just cover
# For your thighs were the cushions
# Of my love and yours for each other
# The songs still are sung
# It was fun to be young
# But please don't be sad where `ere you are
# I am who I am
# You are who you are
# Now Valerie's a woman
# Now Valerie's a woman
# Now Valerie's a woman

# (Elton John/Taupin)
# Me and you we're not that pretty
# Me and you could use a lift
# I'm out here on the corner crying
# I got ribbons but I got no gift
# Me and you we're all we've got
# Me and you could be our curse
# We've got bleeding hearts and flowers
# You got strings but you got no purse
# We're just freaks in love
# Saints above
# Shine on our sweet life
# Happy is the union
# Of fools and freaks alike
# And fearless are the idiots
# Among the hawks and doves
# We're on the outside looking in
# A couple of freaks in love
# There's a wonder in this weakness
# It's so beautiful sometimes
# Across the universe we're lightning
# In the race we're a step behind
# Me and you we're not for everyone
# Me and you we're damaged goods
# We're antique and unacceptable
# And just misunderstood
> Elton John
# Music by Elton John
# Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
# Available on the soundtrack Friends
# I hope the day will be a lighter highway
# For friends are found on every road
# Can you ever think of any better way
# For the lost and weary travellers to go
# Making friends for the world to see
# Let the people know you got what you need
# With a friend at hand you will see the light
# If your friends are there then everything's all right
# It seems to me a crime that we should age
# These fragile times should never slip us by
# A time you never can or shall erase
# As friends together watch their childhood fly
> Elton John
# The roses in the window box
# Have tilted to one side,
# Everything about this house
# Was born to grow and die.
# It doesn't seem a year ago
# To this very day
# You said I'm sorry honey,
# If I don't change the pace,
# I can't face another day.
# And love lies bleeding in my hand,
# It kills me to think of you with another man.
# I was playing rock-n-roll and you were just a fan,
# But my guitar couldn't hold you
# So I spilt the band.
# Love lies bleeding in my hands
# I wonder if those changes
# Have left a scar on you,
# Like all the burning hoops of fire
# That you and I passed through.
# You're bluebird on a telegraph line
# I hope you're happy now,
# Well if the wind of change comes down your way girl
# You'll make it back somehow.

# When it's springtime down in Georgia
# It's winter time up in Maine
# You can go from snow to sunshine
# If you board a southbound train
# You get used to taking orders
# But it's sometimes kind of rough
# I got everything that a man could need
# But it still ain't quite enough
# Taking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
# I sometimes feel my life is rolling on
# Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
# I need to see them one more time before I'm gone
# When it's nighttime down in Georgia
# It's daytime in L.A.
# Where they never seem to do much
# But they sure got lots to say
# The times are changing down in Georgia
# Though not always for the best
# Give me thirty five good acres lord
# And let progress take the rest
# Talking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
# I sometimes feel that life is rolling on
# Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
# I need to see them one more time before they're gone
# Oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
# I sometimes feel that life has passed me by
# Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
# I need to see them one more time before I die

# Jo-Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
# But he knew it couldn't last
# Jo-Jo left his home in Tuscon, Arizona
# For some California grass
# Get back, get back
# Get back to where you once belonged
# Get back, get back
# Get back to where you once belonged
# Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
# But she was another man
# All the girls around her said she's got it coming
# But she gets it while she can
# So get back, get back.......

# You've been crying, and I'm crazy about you
# I've been lying, and hanging you up, `cause
# I'm deep on the inside, but flash on the outside
# I am the thunder, and you are my lightning
# Give me the love, baby, give me the key to your heart
# Give me the love, baby, give me the key to your heart
# Give me the love, give me the key to your heart
# Months of watching, and hours of hoping
# That you'd want me, when you see me again
# For I am an eagle, but my wings are all tied up
# You got the power to fly me again
# You've been trying to build walls all around you
# But you're lying, `cause I've already been through
# And I've seen you trying to capture that feeling
# But you're chasing what you've never believed in
# Tell me you love me, tell me you need me
> Elton John
# It's so hard to say goodbye
# When there's nothing left to give
# When this house is just a hill of bones
# Where you and I once lived
# If we put it back together
# By the skin of our teeth
# You'd still pull it all apart
# Bit by bit, piece by piece
# And I'll go it alone
# Call this house my home
# Build it up again with someone new
# Build it brick by brick
# Till I find a girl that fits
# This home's a whole lot better without you
# There's no passion alive
# When you count your phony schemes
# And the cars you drive to buy your friends
# They don't ever come back clean
# If the cards on the table
# Always turn up spades
# The cards that always cheat the hearts
# The spades you play just dug my grave
> Elton John
# And now that it's all over
# The birds can nest again
# I'll only snow when the sun comes out
# I'll shine only when it starts to rain
# And if you want a drink
# Just squeeze my hand
# And wine will flow into the land
# And feed my lambs
# For I am a mirror
# I can reflect the moon
# I will write songs for you
# I'll be your silver spoon
# I'm sorry I took your time
# I am the poem that doesn't rhyme
# Just turn back a page
# I'll waste away, I'll waste away
# I'll waste away, I'll waste away
# I'll waste away, I'll waste away
> Elton John
# When are you gonna come down ?
# When are you going to land ?
# I should have stayed on the farm
# I should have listened to my old man
# You know you can't hold me forever
# I didn't sign up with you
# I'm not a present for your friends to open
# This boy's too young to be singing the blues
# So goodbye yellow brick road
# Where the dogs society howl
# You can't plant me in your penthouse
# I'm going back to my plough
# Back to the howling old owl in the woods
# Hunting the horny back
# Oh I've finally decided my future lies
# Beyound the yellow brick road
# What do you think you'll do then
# I bet they'll shoot down your plane
# It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
# To set you on your feet again
# Maybe you'll get a replacement
# There's plenty like me to be found
# Mongrels who ain't got a penny
# Sniffing for tib-bits like you.
# On the ground
# So goodbye yellow brick road
# Where the dogs society howl
# You can't plant me in your penthouse
# I'm going back to my plough
# Back to the howling old owl in the woods
# Hunting the horny back
# Oh I've finally decided my future lies
# Beyound the yellow brick road

# Why's it never light on my lawn
# Why does it rain and never say good-day to the new-born
# On the big screen they showed us the sun
# But not as bright in life as the real one
# It's never quite the same as the real one
# And tell me grey seal
# How does it feel
# To be so wise
# To see through eyes
# That only see what's real
# Tell me grey seal
# I never learned why meteors were formed
# I only farmed in schools that were so warn and torn
# If anyone can cry then so can I
# I read books and draw life from the eye
# All my life is drawings from the eye
# Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
# The roots were formed by twisted roots
# Your roots were twisted then
# I was re-born before all life could die
# The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
# If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I

# As I lay dreaming in my bed
# Across the great divide
# I thought I heard the trawler boats
# Returning on the tide
# And in this vision of my home
# The shingle beach did ring
# I saw the lights along the pier
# That made my senses sing
# Oh oh Grimsby, a thousand delights
# Couldn't match the sweet sights
# Of my Grimsby
# Oh England you're fair
# But there's none to compare with my Grimsby
# Through nights of mad youth
# I have loved every sluice in your harbor
# And in your wild sands from boyhood to man
# Strangers have found themselves fathers
# Take me back you rustic town
# I miss your magic charm
# Just to smell your candy floss
# Or drink in the Skinners Arms
# No Cordon Bleu can match the beauty
# Of your pies and peas
# I want to ride your fairground
# Take air along the quay
> Elton John
# Yeah I looked at my watch and it said a quarter to five
# The headlines screamed that I was still alive
# I couldn't understand it
# I thought I died last night
# Oh I dreamed I'd been in a border town
# In a little cantina that the boys had found
# I was desperate to dance
# Just to dig the local sounds
# When along came a seorita
# She looked so good that I had to meet her
# I was ready to approach her with my English charm
# When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me my the arm
# And he said grow some funk of your own amigo
# Grow some funk of your own
# We no like to with the gringo fight
# But there might be a death in Mexico tonight
# If you can't grow some funk of your own amigo
# Grow some funk of your own
# Take my advice, take the next flight
# And grow your funk, grow your funk at home
# Well I looked for support from the rest of my friends
# For their vanishing trick they get ten out of ten
# I knelt to pray
# Just to see if he would comprehend
> Elton John
# Don't wish it away
# Don't look at it like it's forever
# Between you and me
# I could honestly say
# That things can only get better
# And while I'm away
# Dust out the demons inside
# And it won't be long
# Before you and me run
# To the place in our hearts
# Where we hide
# And I guess that's why
# They call it the blues
# Time on my hands
# Could be time spent with you
# Laughing like children
# Living like lovers
# Rolling like thunder under the covers
# And I guess that's why
# They call it the blues
# Just stare into space
# Picture my face in your hands
# Live for each second
# Without hesitation
# And never forget I'm your man
# Without me girl
# Cry in the night if it helps
# But more than ever I simply love you
# More than I love life itself
# And I guess that's why
# They call it the blues
# Time on my hands
# Could be time spent with you
# Laughing like children
# Living like lovers
# Rolling like thunder under the covers
# And I guess that's why
# They call it the blues
# Wait on me girl
# Cry in the night if it helps
# But more than ever I simply love you
# More than I love life itself
# And I guess that's why
# They call it the blues
# Time on my hands
# Could be time spent with you
# Laughing like children
# Living like lovers
# Rolling like thunder under the covers
# And I guess that's why
# They call it the blues

# Gulliver's gone to the final command of his master
# His watery eyes had washed all the hills with his laughter
# And the seasons can change all the light from the grey to the dim
# But the light in his eyes will see no more bright
# As the sheep that he locked in the pen
# There's four feet of ground in front of the barn
# That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
# But now it lies empty so cold and so bare
# Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there
# By passing the doors of his life was a stage I remember
# And in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger
# For sentiment touched him as Cyclamen holds him
# And later men came from the town
# Who said clear the child this won't take a while
# And Gulliver's gone with the dawn
> Elton John
# Hello, baby hello
# Haven't seen your face for a while
# Have you quit doing time for me
# Or are you still the same spoiled child
# Hello, I said hello
# Is this the only place you thought to go
# Am I the only man you ever had
# Or am I just the last surviving friend that you know
# Harmony and me
# We're pretty good company
# Looking for an island
# In our boat upon the sea
# Harmony, gee I really love you
# And I want to love you forever
# And dream of the never, never, never leaving harmony
# Hello, baby hello
# Open up your heart and let your feelings flow
# You're not unlucky knowing me
# Keeping the speed real slow
# In any case I set my own pace
# By stealing the show, say hello, hello
> Elton John
# Have you heard the dogs at night
# Somewhere on the hill
# Chasing some poor criminal
# And I guess they're out to kill
# Oh there must be shackles on his feet
# And mother in his eyes
# Stumbling through the devil-dark
# With the hound pack in full cry
# Have mercy on the criminal
# Who is running from the law
# Are you blind to the winds of change
# Don't you hear him any more
# Praying Lord you got to help me
# I am never gonna sin again
# Just take these chains from around my legs
# Sweet Jesus I'll be your friend
# Now have you ever seen the white teeth gleam
# While you lie on a cold damp ground
# You're taking in the face of a rifle butt
# While the wardens hold you down
# And you've never seen a friend in years
# Oh it turns your heart to stone
# You jump the walls and the dogs run free
# And the grave's gonna be your home
> Elton John
# I've got a good by-line, they all know my name
# The queen of the sly line, I feed on your fame
# But I got my heart in the right place, it's all in the game
# If you're doing fine boy, you got my vote
# But step out of line boy and I'll go for your throat
# 'Cause I got my heart in the right place, so give me a quote
# I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
# You'll open your heart like a friend
# I'll make up some answers you won't recognise
# The you I create with my pen
# But my heart's in the right place now and again
# My heart's in the right place, know what I mean
# My heart's in the right place on page seventeen
# I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
# You don't understand, but you will
# I'll make up some answers, cut you down to size
# Then I move in for the kill
# But my heart's in the right place
# My heart's in the right place
# My heart's in the right place, it's part of the skill
# Heart's in the right place
# I'm gonna destroy you and your reputation
# Don't count for nothing with me
# 'Cause I'm an old bitch you see and my heart's in the right place
# Don't you agree
# Heart's in the right place, just wait and see
# Heart's in the right place, don't you agree
> Elton John
# Just like a broken marriage, when two people just don't care
# Like when the cupboard is empty or there's no food in the Frigidaire
# I'm a page from the end of the story
# No closer to my hope and glory
# Just a kick away from the heels of the wind
# How come it gets so disturbing, when two ships pass in the storm
# Who knows how high the crow flies, who knows where this refugee was born
# I'm a page from the end of the story
# No closer to my hope and glory
# Just a kick away from the heels of the wind
# And just for the sake of all these reasons
# Rains wash out the fires within
# Fires that help to keep you moving
# Just a kick away from the heels of the wind
# You don't deserve that treatment, I can't pretend I was that nice
# I'm no E ticket ride to Disneyland, I'm no cushy first class flight
# I'm a day behind your restless wings
# You, you rather have the wealth of kings
# Me, I'd rather be on the heels of the wind
> Elton John
# Ooh I got a busted wing and a hornet sting
# Like an out of tune guitar
# Ooh she got Hercules on her side
# And Diana in her eyes
# Some men like the Chinese life
# Some men kneel and pray
# Ooh well I like women and I like wine
# And I've always liked it that way
# Always liked it that way
# I can't dig it, the way she tease
# That old tough man routine up her sleeve
# Living and loving, kissing and hugging
# Living and loving with a cat named Hercules
# A cat named Hercules
# Oh and it hurts like hell to see my gal
# Messing with a muscle boy
# No superman gonna ruin my plans
# Playing with my toys
# Rich man sweating in a sauna bath
# Poor boy scrubbing in a tub
# Me, I stay gritty up to my ears
# Washing in a bucket of mud
# Washing in a bucket of mud

# Hey armadillo what you doing in the garden
# Slumbering and spherical, you're always hanging around
# Leather on the outside but a delicate interior
# Very like a lot of human beings I have found
# Hey armadillo I can't tell which way you're facing
# Maybe that's a good thing, maybe you don't even know
# No one's gonna bother you if they can't find your front end
# There again I guess you find your love life rather slow
# In the armadillo circle
# In that armour-plated set
# The philosophy is simple
# What you see ain't what you get
# In the armadillo culture
# In that well-protected creed
# A solid hide to hide in
# Is the only thing you need
# Hey armadillo
# Hey armadillo what you doing in the desert
# Is a life of burrowing the answer to it all
# What I would give to leave my problems six feet underground
# And always be the perfect shape to be, and have, a ball
# In the armadillo circle
# In that armour-plated set
# The philosophy is simple
# What you see ain't what you get
# In the armadillo culture
# In that well-protected creed
# A solid hide to hide in
# Is the only thing you need
# Hey armadillo
# Hey armadillo

# You wore a little cross of gold around your neck
# I saw it as you flew between my reason
# Like a raven in the night time when you left
# I wear a chain upon my wrist that bears no name
# You touched it and you wore it
# And you kept it in your pillow all the same
# My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
# I thought myself her keeper
# She thought I meant her harm
# She thought I was the archer
# A weather man of words
# But I could never shoot down
# My high-flying bird
# The white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red
# You bled upon the cold stone like a young man
# In the foreign field of death
# Wouldn't it be wonderful is all I heard you say
# You never closed your eyes at night and learned to love daylight
# Instead you moved away

# Released as a UK B-side in November, 1973
# Sitting here on Christmas Eve with a brandy in my hand
# Oh I've had a few too many and it's getting hard to stand
# I keep hearing noises from my fireplace
# I must be going crazy or the brandy's won the race
# And I keep hearing ho ho ho, guess who's here
# Your fat and jolly friend draws near
# Ho ho ho, surprise, surprise
# The bearded weirdy's just arrived
# Ho ho ho, guess who's here
# Your fat and jolly friend draws near
# Ho ho ho, surprise surprise
# The bearded wierdy's just arrived
# On my roof there's snorting sounds, and bells inside my head
# My vision's blurred with colour, and all he sees is red
# There's a pair of large sized wellies coming down my flue
# And the smell of burning rubber, oh is filling up the room
> Elton John
# Boston at last and the plane's touching down
# Our hostess is handing the hot towels around
# From a terminal gate to a black limousine
# It's a ten minute ride to the Holiday Inn
# Boredom's a pastime that one soon acquired
# Where you get to the stage where you're not even tired
# Kicking your heels till the time comes around
# To pick up your bags and head out of town
# Slow down Joe, I'm a rock and roll man
# I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
# And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
# In a motel baby like the Holiday Inn
# Oh I don't even know if it's Cleveland or Maine
# With the buildings as big and rooms just the same
# And the TV don't work and the French fries are cold
# And the room service closed about an hour ago
> Elton John
# When I look back boy I must have been green
# Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
# Looking for an answer trying to find a sign
# Until I saw your city lights honey I was blind
# They said get back honky cat
# Better get back to the woods
# Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
# And oh the change is gonna do me good
# You better get back honky cat
# Living in the city ain't where it's at
# It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
# It's like trying to drink whisky from a bottle of wine
# Well I read some books and I read some magazines
# About those high class ladies down in New Orleans
# And all the folks back home well, said I was a fool
# They said oh, believe in the Lord is the golden rule
# They said stay at home boy, you gotta tend the farm
# Living in the city boy, is going to break your heart
# But how can you stay, when your heart says no
# How can you stop when your feet say go
> Elton John
# You say that all you want are the simple things
# Long walks on lonely beaches, guitars with nylon strings
# But underneath you'd rather leap through a hoop of fire
# You shy away from lips that want, that want to kiss you
# Tongue-tied on formal evenings, wealth don't impress you
# But if you ask me you like the heat in a hoop of fire
# And it's hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire
# Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire
# Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire
# No late nights making love in secret places
# You feel pressure all around you, mistrust in strangers faces
# But don't pretend you wouldn't spend some time in a hoop of fire
# But don't pretend you wouldn't spend some time in a hoop of fire

# Released as a UK B-side in May, 1975
# I hear tell some playboy has kidnapped your heart
# With his plane and his plans for games after dark
# Just a pain in his pocket, and the price of a room
# Where the second hand sheets smell of stale perfume
# If there's sharks in the water, don't swim where it's deep
# For the taste of success can be bitter and sweet
# It could be alright that I act like a child
# But you'll be the loser when the jokers run wild
# You're just playing the game, but the stakes are too high
# What will you do when the chips start to fly
# When the deck's stacked against you, and the living gets hard
# Oh it's four walls of madness in this house of cards
# Common you call me, but I know there's time
# In a handful of diamonds, a heart's hard to find
# And your house of cards starts weighing you down
# Your nights become restless when the clubs start to pound

# Lyrics by Tim Rice
# I grew up in your hometown, at least began to grow
# I hadn't got to my first shave before the body blow
# Egyptians in the courtyard, my family in chains
# You witnessed our abduction which possibly explains
# How I know you
# How I know you
# Before that fateful morning my family enjoyed
# A privileged existence, for my father was employed
# As advisor to the king, no less, which surely rings a bell
# For as you are his daughter, you probably can tell
# How I know you
# How I know you
# Enough of reminiscence, and such happy memories
# The reason why I know you well is really none of these
# It's just you reek of royalty, you ooze uncommon grace
# I'd know you were a princess, in any time and place
# Yes I know you
# How I know you
# Yes I know you
# How I know you
> Elton John
# She chose the soft center
# And took it to bed with her mother
# And the ideal confusion
# Was just an illusion
# To gain further news of her brother
# And the comfort of mother
# Was just an appeal for protection
# For the cat from next door
# Was found later at four
# In surgical dissection
# And I don't want to be
# The son of any freak
# Who for a chocolate center
# Can take you off the street
# For soon they'll plough the desert
# And God knows where I'll be
# Collecting submarine numbers
# On the main street of the sea
# The Vicar is thicker
# And I just can't see through to him
# For his cardinal sings
# A collection of hymns
# And a collection of coins is made after
# And who wrote the Bible
# Was it Judas or Pilate
# Well one cleans his hands
# While the other one hangs
# But still I continue to stand
> Elton John
# I've been beaming aboard her for a light year
# From a strange craft
# She's got a subtle touch on the silver key
# To a clockwork heart
# I am your robot, I am your robot
# I am your robot man
# I am your robot, I am your robot
# I am your robot man
# You went and flipped the switch and turned me positive
# When I was negative
# I've been stumbling around like a metal man
# On the graveyard shift
# I am your robot and I'm programmed to love you
# My serial number is 44357
> Elton John
# I can't keep this from you
# I've held it in so long
# It's time to tell the truth
# Keeping it from you is wrong
# I can't keep this from you
# It's so simple I'm afraid
# When I tell you how I feel
# You'll just laugh and call me crazy
# And I can't keep
# This love a secret
# And I don't want
# To go on longing
# I just want a chance for me to prove
# My love and I can't keep this from you
# I can't keep this from you
# It's hard to breathe in here
# I just seem to act the fool
# Every time I feel you near
# I can't keep this from you
# No matter what you say
# Anything is better now
# Than going through my life this way
# And I can't keep
# This love a secret
# And I don't want
# To go on longing
# I just want a chance for me to prove
# My love and I can't keep this from you
# And I love every move you make
# Can't you hear every heart you break?
# And don't you know when I hear your name?
# Just the sound of it shoots me down in flames
# And I can't keep
# This love a secret
# And I don't want
# To go on longing
# I just want a chance for me to prove
# My love and I can't keep this from you
# I can't keep
# This love a secret
# And I don't want
# To go on longing
# I just want a chance for me to prove
# My love and I can't keep this from you
# I just want a chance for me to prove
# My love and I can't keep this from you
# Oh no I just can't keep this from you
> Elton John
# And every time I get to thinking
# Every thought of you I want to shout aloud
# Then I think about the love I have inside me
# How you brought what's inside out
# Now love's made it to the outside
# I want to tell the world of everthing I've found
# Somehow your love released a spring wound up inside me
# You turned my living upside down
# And I can't tell the bottom from the top
# Am I standing on my head or on my heels
# Is it cloudy, is it bright
# Is it day or is it night
# Am I wrong or am I right
# And is it real
# Tell me where you learned the magic
# The spell you used the day you made me fall
# Maybe now I know that love is no illusion
# I'm upside down but ten feet tall
# On and on I've drifted with the tide
# I didn't know that love could move me so
# You fed my life with love and much more besides
# And you showed me which way to go
> Elton John
# I got feet sticking out of my shoes
# I got heat more than I can use
# I got love, I got all I need
# I got soles that are wearing thin
# I got holes where the rain gets in
# I got you and that's enough for me
# I don't care, I don't care
# I don't care, I don't care
# I don't care, I don't care
# I don't care, long as I got your love
# Clothes that are falling apart
# I got a car that refuses to start
# I got love, I do the best I can
# I got bills piling up in the hall
# I got paint peeling off the wall
# I got you, I'm a happy man
> Elton John
# Don't wish it away
# Don't look at it like it's forever
# Between you and me
# I could honestly say
# That things can only get better
# And while I'm away
# Dust out the demons inside
# And it won't be long
# Before you and me run
# To the place in our hearts
# Where we hide
# And I guess that's why
# They call it the blues
# Time on my hands
# Could be time spent with you
# Laughing like children
# Living like lovers
# Rolling like thunder under the covers
# And I guess that's why
# They call it the blues
# Just stare into space
# Picture my face in your hands
# Live for each second
# Without hesitation
# And never forget I'm your man
# Wait on me girl
# Cry in the night if it helps
# But more than ever I simply love you
# More than I love life itself
# And I guess that's why
# They call it the blues

# Lyrics by Tim Rice
# Available on the soundtrack The Lion King
# Way behind the water hole
# A little down the line
# The jungle and the plains and peaks
# Are scheduled to be mine
# I'm gonna be the ruler
# Of most everything around
# From the grandest of the mountains
# To the humble common ground
# My reign will be a super awesome thing
# Oh, I just can't wait to be king
# I'm gonna be a noble king
# Unscrupulously fair
# I only need a little time
# Perhaps a little hair
# I'm gonna be the mane event
# Like no king was before
# I'm brushing up on looking down
# I'm working on my roar
# The fauna and the flora gonna swing
# Oh, I just can't wait to be king
# No one saying do this
# No one saying be there
# No one saying stop that
# No one saying see here
# Free to run around all day
# I'll be free to do it my way
# The time has come as someone said
# To talk of many things
# This may be true
# But I would rather stick to talking kings
# It's easy to be royal if you're already leonine
# It isn't just my right even my left will be divine
# The monarchy is waiting to go zing
# Oh I just can't wait to be king

# How have I come to this
# How did I slip and fall
# How did I throw half a lifetime away
# Without any thought at all
# This should've been my time
# It's over, it never began
# Facing a world, for once not on my side
# I simply turned and ran
# I try to blame it on fortune
# Some kind of twist in my fate
# But I know the truth and it haunts me
# I learned it a little too late
# I know the truth and it mocks me
# I know the truth and it shocks me
# I learned it a little too late
# People have faith in me
# I think I once did too
# I promise whoever has a hold on our lives
# I'll see the bad times through
# This should have been my time
# It's over, it never began
# Facing a world, for once not on my side
# I simply turned and ran
# I try to blame it on fortune
# Some kind of shift in the stars
# But I know the truth and it haunts me
# It's flown just a little too far
# I know the truth and it mocks me
# I know the truth and it shocks me
# It's flown just a little too far
# I try to blame it on fortune
# Some kind of twist in my fate
# But I know the truth and it haunts me
# I learned it a little too late

# "I meant to do my work today
# The brown bird sang in the apple tree
# I know that's why ....
# And a butterfly flittered accross the field
# And all the leaves were calling me
# And the Buttercups nodded their smiling heads
# Greeting the bees who came to call
# And I asked the lizard the time of day....."
# And the wind went sighing over the land,
# Tossing the grasses to and fro,
# And a rainbow held out its shining handâ€”
# So what could I do but laugh and go?
> Elton John
# You're not a ship to carry my life
# You are nailed to my love in many lonely nights
# I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
# For I need your love your love protects my fears
# And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind
# But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
# And I need you to turn to when I lose control
# You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold
# Did you paint your smile on, well I said I knew
# That my reason for living was for loving you
# We're related in feeling but you're high above
# You're pure and you're gentle with the grace of a dove
> Elton John
# We are still all right
# We took it on the chin
# But in the thirteenth hour
# No one ever wins
# But we're strong enough
# Like traffic all tied up
# And when the static clears
# The radios still buzz
# And I stop and I breathe
# 'Cause you wanted me
# And I wanted you so bad
# And I stop and I breathe
# 'Cause I still believe
# No one really knows what it is that we have
# Like blood in a vein
# We chased this one down
# And in the darkest long night
# We turned it all around
# And it was coal-dusted snow
# That covered the fields
# But the corn it still grew
# And the injury healed
# And I stop and I breathe
# 'Cause you wanted me
# And I wanted you so bad
# And I stop and I breathe
# 'Cause I still believe
# No one really knows what it is that we have
# And I stop and I breathe
# 'Cause you wanted me
# And I wanted you so bad
# And I stop and I breathe
# 'Cause I still believe
# No one really knows what it is that we have

# Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
# Released as a UK B-side in 1990
# In the nicotine glare of a cold naked light
# I drag my body from the covers and down forty flights
# I run out the front door into the center of the street
# I scream out your name as the steam just swells around my feet
# I hear you after midnight from the inner city
# As every Cinderella turns to drop dead pretty
# We were built out of the darkness into this West Side Story
# We came together in the shadows but the moon just steals our glory
# Well this is my battleground baby
# This is my plaything
# The only thing I've ever known
# Outside of a wedding ring
# And I swear I heard the night talking
# Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless
# Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken
# Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken
# And all we ever do is listen to the night talking
# On the burden of insanity we can't find the cause
# On a flatbed truck well the home girl she paints her claws
# There's a coward who gets his courage undercover of the dark
# And it's a strange breed of devil freeze at night to go walking in the park
> Elton John
# I'm getting bored
# Being part of mankind
# There's not a lot to do no more
# This race is a waste of time
# People rushing everywhere
# Swarming around like flies
# Think I'll buy a forty four
# Give them all a surprise
# Think I'm gonna kill myself
# Cause a little suicide
# Stick around for a couple of days
# What a scandal if I died
# Yeah I'm gonna kill myself
# Get a little headline news
# I'd like to see what the papers say
# On the state of teenage blues
# A rift in my family
# I can't use the car
# I gotta be in by ten o'clock
# Who do they think they are
# I'd make an exception
# If you want to save my life
# Brigitte Bardot gotta come
# And see me every night
> Elton John
# I want love, but it's impossible
# A man like me, so irresponsible
# A man like me is dead in places
# Other men feel liberated
# I can't love, shot full of holes
# Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
# Don't feel nothing, just old scars
# Toughening up around my heart
# But I want love, just a different kind
# I want love, won't break me down
# Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
# I want a love, that don't mean a thing
# That's the love I want, I want love
# I want love on my own terms
# After everything I've ever learned
# Me, I carry too much baggage
# Oh man I've seen so much traffic
# So bring it on, I've been bruised
# Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
# I'm ready for the rougher stuff
# No sweet romance, I've had enough
> Elton John
# He was a light star
# Tripping on a high wire
# Bulldog stubborn, born uneven
# A classless creature, a man for all seasons
# But don't bet them
# They can't take him
# To the very bottom
# Because they made him and they'll waste him
# And I don't believe that I want to watch them
# 'Cause the fifties shifted out of gear
# He was an idol then, now he's an idol here
# But his face has changed, he's not the same no more
# And I have to say that I like the way his music sounded before
# He was tight-assed
# Walking on broken glass
# Highly prized in the wallet size
# The number one crush in a schoolgirl's eyes
# But don't pretend that it won't end
# In the depth of your despair
# You went from lame suits right down to tennis shoes
# To peanuts from the lion's share
> Elton John
# Torn from their families
# Mothers go hungry
# To feed their children
# But children go hungry
# There's so many big men
# They're out making millions
# When poverty's profits
# Just blame the children
# If there's a God in heaven
# What's he waiting for
# If He can't hear the children
# Then he must see the war
# But it seems to me
# That he leads his lambs
# To the slaughter house
# And not the promised land
# Dying for causes
# They don't understand
# We've been taking their futures
# Right out of their hands
# They need the handouts
# To hold back the tears
# There's so many crying
# But so few that hear
# If there's a God in heaven
# Well, what's he waiting for
# If there's a God in heaven
# What's he waiting for
> Elton John
# Well there's slim times when my words won't rhyme
# And the hills I face are a long hard climb
# I just sit cross legged with my old guitar
# It kind of makes me feel like a rock and roll star
# Well it makes me laugh Lord it makes me cry
# And I think for once let me just get high
# Let me get electric put a silk suit on
# Turn my old guitar into a tommy gun
# And root-toot-shoot myself to fame
# Every kid alive gonna know my name
# An overnight phenomenon like there's never been
# A motivated supersonic king of the scene
# I'll be a teenage idol, just give me a break
# I'm gonna be a teenage idol no matter how long it takes
# You can't imagine what it means to me
# I'm gonna grab myself a place in history
# A teenage idol that's what I'm gonna be
# Well life is short and the world is rough
# And if you're gonna boogie boy you got to be tough
# Nobody knows if I'm dead or alive
# I just drink myself to sleep each night
# And so I pray to the teenage god of rock
# If I make it big let me stay on top
# You got to cut me loose from this one room dive
# Put me on the ladder keep this boy alive
> Elton John
# You could never know what its like
# Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
# And theres a cold lonely light that shines from you
# You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
# And did you think this fool could never win
# Well look at me, I'm coming back again
# I got a taste of love in a simple way
# And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away
# Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
# Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
# I'm still standing after all this time
# Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
# I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
# I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
# Once I never could hope to win
# You starting down the road leaving me again
# The threats you made were meant to cut me down
# And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now
# Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
# Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
# I'm still standing after all this time
# Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
# I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
# I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah

# Lipstick and lashes, the traces of stardom
# Lit up on a billboard so everyone sees them in neon
# Behind the counter she stares out the window
# Up at the billboard that's like a reminder in neon
# She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
# Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
# For two cents of danger she'd trust anybody
# She'd smoke like a gun if it meant she might wind up
# In neon the dreams in the light of a promise that dies
# A shimmering city, a glimmer of hope and a lie
# In neon the name's gone there's no reason why anymore
# Trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door
# In neon, in neon
# Pictures and patterns, the touches of glamour
# Cut into a fashion that flashes above them in neon
# A hot cup of coffee held in her fingers
# A perfect complexion that lingers above her in neon
# She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
# Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
# For a shot at the title, she'd slip into something
# She'd smoulder like ashes if it meant she might wind up in neon
# In neon
> Elton John
# As I awoke this evening with the smell of wood smoke clinging
# Like a gentle cobweb hanging upon a painted teepee
# Oh I went to see my chieftain with my warlance and my woman
# For he told us that the yellow moon would very soon be leaving
# This I can't believe I said, I can't believe our warlord's dead
# Oh he would not leave the chosen ones to the buzzards and the soldiers guns
# Oh great father of the Iroquois ever since I was young
# I've read the writing of the smoke and breast fed on the sound of drums
# I've learned to hurl the tomahawk and ride a painted pony wild
# To run the gauntlet of the Sioux, to make a chieftain's daughter mine
# And now you ask that I should watch
# The red man's race be slowly crushed
# What kind of words are these to hear
# From Yellow Dog whom white man fears
# I take only what is mine Lord, my pony, my squaw, and my child
# I can't stay to see you die along with my tribe's pride
# I go to search for the yellow moon and the fathers of our sons
# Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run
# Trampling down the prairie rose leaving hoof tracks in the sand
# Those who wish to follow me I welcome with my hands
# I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead
# He'd been laying down his weapons when they filled him full of lead
# Now there seems no reason why I should carry on
# In this land that once was my land I can't find a home
# It's lonely and it's quiet and the horse soldiers are coming
# And I think it's time I strung my bow and ceased my senseless running
# For soon I'll find the yellow moon along with my loved ones
# Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields without the sound of guns
# And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
# And peace to this young warrior comes with a bullet hole

# Released as a UK B-side in January, 1971
# I'm moving out of Tombstone, yeah with the sun behind my back
# I'm tired of people talking of things that I lack
# Ever since a week ago, the day he passed away
# I've been taking too much notice of the things they've had to say
# And all they say is you ain't half the man he used to be
# He had strength and he worked his life to feed his family
# So if that's the way it has to be, I'll say goodbye to you
# I'm not the guy, or so it seems to fill my old man's shoes
# Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed
# They'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains
# Oh it's hard and I can't see what they want me to do Lord, Lord
# They seem to think I should step into the old man's shoes

# I see your teeth flash, Jamaican honey so sweet
# Down where Lexington cross 47th Street
# She's a big girl, she's standing six foot three
# Turning tricks for the dudes in the big city
# Island girl
# What you wanting with the white man's world
# Island girl
# Black boy want you in his island world
# He want to take you from the racket boss
# He want to save you but the cause is lost
# Island girl, island girl, island girl
# Tell me what you wanting with the white man's world
# She's black as coal but she burn like a fire
# And she wrap herself around you like a well worn tire
# You feel her nail scratch your back just like a rake
# He one more gone, he one more John who make the mistake

# It ain't gonna be easy from now on
# You've been messing around while I've been gone
# But sometimes telling the truth can be unkind
# Folks who suffer guilt can be so blind
# It ain't gonna be easy I can tell
# Just how empty I'm feeling you know damn well
# I'm telling you it ain't gonna be easy from the start
# Look out honey you're playing with my heart
# It ain't gonna be easy that's for sure
# Changing things back the way they were before
# Once you've lifted the lid on such pain
# It ain't easy to put it back again
# It ain't gonna be easy to forget
# You've been seeing a man that I ain't met
# I'm telling you that it ain't gonna be easy from the start
# Look out baby, you're playing with my heart
# It ain't gonna be so easy this time around
# Turning back the clock on what's gone down
# Oh there comes a time when you need to make a stand
# You gotta play your cards or fold a losing hand
# And it ain't gonna be easy that's no lie
# But if you're willing to try it so am I
# It ain't gonna be so easy from the start
# You better look out darling, you're playing with my heart

# It's getting dark in here
# Don't want to leave
# Shadow's falling
# And I believe
# Winds picking up
# Thing's so unclear
# I'm afraid of my shadow
# And it's getting dark in here
# I'm scared of strangers
# On the street
# World's so ugly
# I can't breath
# Moon's so spooky
# I'm close to tears
# I've lost it all
# And it's getting dark in here
# And the wait isn't worth what I'm getting
# Sometimes I feel I'm on fire
# I've been handed a curse and a blessing
# My life's been stripped down to the wire
# And I'm trying to get back and hold on
# Find someone somewhere who cares
# But the sun's always setting on my life
# And it's sure getting dark in here
# Don't talk about angels
# Or how I'll be saved
# I'm no coward
# But I'm not that brave
# Rags are blowing
# Rain's getting near
# I'm done with running
# And it's getting dark in here
# And the wait isn't worth what I'm getting
# Sometimes I feel I'm on fire
# I've been handed a curse and a blessing
# My life's been stripped down to the wire
# And I'm trying to get back and hold on
# Find someone somewhere who cares
# But the sun's always setting on my life
# And it's sure getting dark in here
# And the wait isn't worth what I'm getting
# Sometimes I feel I'm on fire
# I've been handed a curse and a blessing
# My life's been stripped down to the wire
# And I'm trying to get back and hold on
# Find someone somewhere who cares
# But the sun's always setting on my life
# And it's sure getting dark in here
# Yeah, the sun's always setting on my life

# Hey there
# Look in the mirror
# Are you afraid you might see me looking at you
# Waiting, waiting at windows
# Oh it's me that you need
# Yes it's me and I'm waiting for you
# But I remain silent
# Oh I won't say a word
# I leave you to realise I'm the light in your world
# And it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
# That you're needing
# It's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
# That you need
# Yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
# If you want to be living
# I'm the one who's forgiving
# Admit that it's me that you need
# Watching, watching the swallows fly
# It all means the same
# Just like them
# You can fly home again
# But don't, no don't forget yesterday
# Pride is an ugly word girl
# And you still know my name
> Elton John
# I didn't mean to hurt you
# You know it's just my way
# Those things that I said yesterday
# Were things I shouldn't say
# Although you're blue
# Just one thing I want you to do
# Just forget all those things
# That I said about you
# 'Cause I've been loving you baby
# Loving you baby for a long time
# And if you go away
# I just won't know what to do
# Yes I've been loving you baby
# Loving you baby for a long time
# And you know in your heart
# That I'll always worship you
# I couldn't bear to see you go
# Oh no no no no
# So don't you feel sad
# It's not the thing to do
# Because I worry
# If I know you're feeling blue
# Please put your tears away
# So nobody can see
# 'Cause the last thing I want
# Is for you to cry over me
> Elton John
# I can see by your eyes you must be lying
# When you think I don't have a clue
# Baby you're crazy
# If you think that you can fool me
# Because I've seen that movie too
# The one where the players are acting surprised
# Saying love's just a four letter word
# Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes
# Well their actions become so absurd
# So keep your auditions for somebody
# Who hasn't got so much to lose
# `Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
# That I've seen that movie too
# It's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around
# Stop twinkling your star like you do
# I'm not the blue print for all of your B films
# Because I've seen that movie too
> Elton John

# Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
# Released as a UK B-side in June, 1973
# Go jack-rabbit running through the wood
# You had a good night and you feel real loose
# Heard they got you going round the goosecreek shed
# Trying to fill your belly full of buckshot lead
# Go jack-rabbit get the cabbage patch
# Farmer left the back porch door on the latch
# Heard you coming and he got his gun
# Better go jack-rabbit better start to run
# Go jack-rabbit running through the wood
# You had a good night and you feel real loose
# Gunfire breaking up the peaceful night
# Jack-rabbit lying in the cold daylight
> Elton John
# When she gets up in the morning
# It's enough to wake the dead
# Oh she turning on the radio
# And dancing on my head
# It's no good living in the sun
# Playing guitar all day
# Boogalooing with my friends
# In that erotic way
# Come on Jamaica
# In Jamaica all day
# Dancing with your darling
# Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
# Come on Jamaica
# Everybody say
# We're all happy in Jamaica
# Do Jamaica Jerk-off that way
# Let the ladies and the gentlemen
# Be as rude as they like
# On the beaches, oh in the jungle
# Where the people feel alright
# So do it Jamaica
# Got plenty for you and me
# Honky tonking with my baby
# In that deep blue sea
> Elton John
# Must have been the right month
# Must have been a good time
# Must have counted every cloud in the sky that night
# Every single glass of wine
# Must have learned some home truths
# Sitting in that cool grass
# Must have counted every blade in that emerald field
# Every shooting star that passed
# Should have had a talk with God
# Sitting in the great unknown
# Watching all the lovers in the world get together
# Sitting in Heaven all alone
# And we were love's knot after summer
# Tied together in the dead of winter
# Wrapped up with spring fever in the air
# Bound together in the autumn
# Every month means a little something
# But January is the month that cares
# Must have kissed you 'till I hurt you
# Must have been a wild night
# Must have rolled in the ashes at the break of day
# Rag dolls in the morning light
# Must have found a secret place
# Hiding in our own world
# Must have counted every smile on your sweet, sweet lips
# Every single sound we heard
> Elton John
# Outside I can hear the fireworks
# Beyond the paper walls
# Where the symbols painted black and white
# Run together when the rain falls
# And the wind chimes across Kyoto
# Each time the earth moves
# Was it the quake that shook me
# Or was it something to do with you
# And the hot wind heats the bamboo blinds
# And your almond eyes always shine
# Sitting cool behind your painted fan
# All the secrets of the east
# Conceal the beauty and the beast
# For tender is the man in her Japanese hands
# Flesh on silk looks different
# Than on a cotton sheet back home
# Where no one wears their hair like yours
# Beneath those oriental combs
# And with your thirsty fingers
# Running up and down my spine
# You forget the western woman
# When you're sleeping on Kyoto time
# And the sky explodes
# and the moon grows cold
# To the distant sound of drums
# And the sky explodes
# And the moon grows cold
# As the dragons on the mainland
# Wait to heat the sun
> Elton John
# Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
# Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
# There stood an log cabin made of earth and wood
# Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
# Who never learned to read or write so well
# But he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
# Go go
# Go Johnny go go go
# Go Johnny go go go
# Go Johnny go go go
# Go Johnny go go go
# Go go Johnny B. Goode
# He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
# Sat beneath the tree by the railroad track
# An engineer could see him sitting in the shade
# Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
# The People passing by, they would stop and say
# Oh my, how that little country boy could play
# His mother told him, someday you will be a man
# You will be the leader of a big old band
# Many people coming from miles around
# To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
# And maybe someday your name will be in lights
# Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight
> Elton John
# Remember Belgium and the Brussels Museum
# Where we piled on the front steps like stray cavaliers
# Our code of living meant little to others
# The few francs we saved bought some cheap souvenirs
# But the red lights where the catfights make it just like Belgium
# See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom
# Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change
# And your sweet madame makes it seem just like Belgium
# Just like a hustler when they look attractive
# It's nothing more than a slap on the back
# The price tag of being just a little bit different
# The first rule to learn is to keep your own distance
> Elton John
# Well she looked a peach in the dress she made
# When she was still her mama's little girl
# And when she walked down the aisle everybody smiled
# At her innocence and curls
# And when the preacher said is there anyone here
# Got a reason why they shouldn't wed
# I should have stuck up my hand
# I should have got up to stand
# And this is what I should have said
# I wanna kiss the bride yeah!
# I wanna kiss the bride yeah!
# Long before she met him
# She was mine, mine, mine
# Don't say I do
# Say bye, bye, bye
# And let me kiss the bride yeah!
# Underneath her veil I could see a tear
# Trickling down her pretty face
# And when she slipped on the ring I knew everything
# Would never be the same again
# But if the groom would have known he'd have had a fit
# About his wife and the things we did
# And what I planned to say
# Yeah on her wedding day
# Well I thought it but I kept it hid
> Elton John
# Look up little brother
# Can you see the clover
# No not over there
# A little bit left and over there
# Now look and see the lilac tree
# The lily pond, the skylark's song
# The open air but no one cares
# If branches live and die out there
# Remember when you were nine
# And I was ten
# We would run into the woods
# No we never will again
# And Lady, what's tomorrow
# What's tomorrow anyway
# If it's not the same as now
# It's the same as yesterday
# Yes Lady, what's tomorrow
# Will it be the same as now
# Will the farmer push the pen
# Will the writer pull the plough
# Look up little brother
# Can you see the clover
# Oh sorry but it's over
# Now there's concrete and no clover

# Levon
# Elton John
# (Elton John/Bernie Taupin)
# Levon wears his war wound like a crown
# He calls his child Jesus 'cause he likes the name
# And he sends him to the finest school in town.
# Levon, Levon likes his money
# He makes a lot they say
# Spend his days counting
# In a garage by the motorway
# He was born a pauper
# To a pawn on a Christmas day
# When the New York Times
# Said God is dead and war's begun
# Alvin Tostig has a son today
# And he shall be Levon
# And he shall be a good man
# And he shall be Levon
# In tradition with the family plan
# And he shall be Levon
# And he shall be a good man
# He shall be Levon.
# Levons sells cartoon balloons in town
# His family business thrives
# Jesus blows up balloons all day
# Sits on the porch swing watching them fly
# And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
# Leave Levon far behind
# Take a balloon and go sailing,
# While Levon, Levon slowly dies.
# And he shall be Levon
# And he shall be a good man
# He shall be Levon

# Grey London morning, wet London streets
# Rain on the window, wind in the trees
# It's my time to write, it's your time to call
# There's something about distance that gets to us all
# Dark clouds above me, little people below
# All walk with a purpose with someplace to go
# It's my place to paint my own selfish scene
# On this cold lonely canvas, it's just the weather and me
# And latitude
# Fold back the morning and bring on the night
# There's an alien moon
# That hangs between darkness and light
# Latitude between me and you
# You're a straight line of distance
# A cold strech of black across blue
# Latitude
# Cracks in the sidewalks, dogs on the run
# An old poster reading "Give us your sons"
# Window frames capture moments in time
# But latitude captures the heart and the mind
> Elton John
# Do you pray to someone new
# When you're locked up in the rock
# Is the golden age dead and gone
# Are the hands stuck on the clock
# Can you talk to Buddy's bones
# When you spin a forty five
# The king ain't dead, he's just asleep
# Somewhere in the after life
# And look at them boys in leather jackets
# Second skin, not fade away
# Danger girls love leather jackets
# Play back to back, and that'll be the day
# Leather jackets, that'll be the day
# We all need to smell the heat
# You know that things go better with chrome
# Is Memphis real or just a song
# Three thousand miles from home
# Be a cool jerk, don't work
# When fashion makes you change
# Keep the faith, don't waste
# Another nickel on another name
# And idolise twisted cars
# Like taxi cabs and spiders
# Eternity's just down the road
# They're looking for more riders
> Elton John
# Your accountant called this morning
# There was springtime in his heart
# He couldn't wait to tell me
# How he'd pulled our lives apart
# And the letter from your lawyer
# Lies unopened on the tray
# I may get around to reading it later today
# Walking round the lonely rooms
# I see everything the same
# But suddenly it matters
# What was purchased in my name
# Whether this or that was paid for
# Belongs to me or you
# Can the seven years together be divided by two
# It says something for the legal boys
# But nothing much for us
# That all we had together
# Is so quickly ended thus
# The legal boys have won again
# And you and I have lost
# They can't tell us how it happened
# But they'll let us know the cost
# Oh they'll let us know the cost, oh yeah
# There's a lot I'd like to tell you
# But I can't get past your guards
# I do not speak their language
# And they hold all the cards
# I would rather call you darling
# Than defendant in the case
# But lovers left here long ago
# And clients took their place

# Available on the album Rare Masters
# I may not seem your ideal when you look into my eyes
# I don't smoke, I don't tell jokes, I'm not the custom made size
# But baby let me take you out on the highway for a while
# I'll show yow where the man in me is when he doesn't hide
# Well he's cruising in the fast lane, stuck behind the wheel
# Jekyll and Hyde going on inside when I'm your automobile
# Let me be your car for a while child
# Shift me into gear and I'll be there
# Fill me up with five star gasoline girl
# I'll be your car, I'll take you anywhere
# Let me be your car, come on and drive me
# I'm a speedy little boy down deep inside
# I got bucket seats and two speed window cleaners
# Just let me be your car, oh come on and ride
# I can't dance, I don't dig it, I can't see it at all
# You say I'm just a specimen, and baby I can crawl
# Well my physique don't look the way the physiques really should
# But then again I've got an engine underneath my hood
# When I'm cutting up the road with a sports car on my tail
# Frankenstein's inside my mind, and the wind's inside my sails

# Some lie about who they love
# Some lie about the truth
# Some lie to save their lives
# Some lie about their youth
# Some lie about age and beauty
# The conquest of sex
# Most lie about the night before
# A woman lies for a party dress
# I've lied for a stolen moment
# I've lied for one more clue
# I've lied about most everything
# But I never lied to you
# And we lie, lie, lie on a streetcar named desire
# Oh we lie, lie, lie for that sweet bird of youth
# I could be great like Tennessee Williams
# If I could only hear something that sounds like the truth
# Some lie in the face of death
# Some lie about their fame
# Some kneel and lie to God
# Some lie about their name
# Some lie in words and speeches
# With every living breath
# The young lie with their guitars
# The old lie for a little respect
# I've lied to lie with danger
# I've lied for a drug or two
# I've lied about most everything
# But I never lied to you
# I've lied for a stolen moment
# I've lied for one more clue
# I've lied about most everything
# But I never lied to you.

# Like father, like son
# Like father, like son
# Like father, like son
# Don't come on so cocksure boy, you can't escape your genes
# No point in feeling purer boy, your background intervenes
# Listen good and listen straight, you're not the master of your fate
# To this you must be reconciled, you'll always be your father's child
# At times acclaimed, at times reviled
# You'll wind up doing just what I've done
# Like father, like son
# Like father, like son
# Don't assume your vices get handed down the line
# That a parent's blood suffices to condemn the child's design
# I've done wrong, I can't deny, but at least I know that I
# Shouldn't blame that on my stock, this may come as quite a shock
# But I'm no chip off any block, I wouldn't wish those words on anyone
# Like father, like son
# Like father, like son
# Son, you're nervous, take my hand
# All is settled, all is planned
# You've got the world at your command
# I don't think you understand
# Just have the slave if you must, and be done with her
# Don't ever speak of her like that again
# I appreciate too well, the squalor at which you excel
# It isn't very hard to tell, evil's a distinctive smell
# From this day on I choose my own way
# If I choose to be with Aida, then I will be
# And no one, not you, not even the gods can stop me
# He's lost all sense of reason, and why? some foreign slut
# Not only is that treason, some doors are slamming shut
# Just like me, he's found that flesh can excite but will enmesh
# Watch me rid him of this blight, once the harlot's out of sight
# Then I think he will see the light
# He won't walk back to daddy, he will run
# Like father, like son
# Like father, like son
# Like father, like son
# Like father, like son

# She looked so easy `cause she looked so young
# With a geisha smile made in Taiwan
# She got cherry bombs inside her eyes
# And the luck of the Irish on her side
# Don't let her tell you that she loves your mind
# She's got her price, she can turn on a dime
# Those crocodile tears ain't tears of pain
# Look a little closer, that's acid rain
# And I don't know
# Why li'l frigerator you're so cold
# Go li'l frigerator go
# Get away from my soul
# Li'l frigerator you're so cold
# She's calculated with the kiss of death
# Got a digital mind and expensive breath
# She's an empty shell, you're a piece of meat
# Just another statistic on her readout sheet

# Oh little Jeannie, you got so much love, little Jeannie
# And you take it where it strikes and give it to the likes of me
# Oh little Jeannie, she got so much love, little Jeannie
# So I see you when I can, you make me all a man can be
# And I want you to be my acrobat, I want you to be my lover
# Oh there were others who would treat you cruel
# And oh little Jeannie, you were always someone's fool
# Little Jeannie, you got so much time, little Jeannie
# Though you've grown beyond your years, you still retain the fears of youth
# Oh little Jeannie, you got so much time, little Jeannie
# But you're burning it up so fast, searching for some lasting truth
# And I want you to be my acrobat, I want you to be my lover
# Oh there were others who would treat you cruel
# But oh Jeannie, I will always be your fool
# And I want you to be my acrobat, I want you to be my lover
# Oh there were others, and I've known quite a few
# But oh oh Jeannie, I'm still in love with you
# Stepped into my life from a bad dream
# Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
# Oh Jeannie I'm so in love with you
# Stepped into my life from a bad dream

# I can't control this flesh and blood
# That's wrapped around my bones
# It moves beneath me like a river
# Into the great unknown
# I stepped onto the moving stairs
# Before I could tie my shoes
# Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
# Who lived and died the blues
# And his promise made was never clear
# It just carved itself in me
# All I saw was frost inside my head
# On the night he said to me
# Someday we'll live like horses
# Free rein from your old iron fences
# There's more ways than one to regain your senses
# Break out the stalls and we'll live like horses
# We're the victims of the heartbreak
# That kept us short of breath
# Trapped above these bloodless streets
# Without a safety net
# I stood in line to join the trial
# One more customer of fate
# Claimed a spoke in the wheel of the wagon train
# On the road to the golden gate
# On the flat cracked desert I jumped ship
# It just made sense to me
# I've spent too long in the belly of the beast
# And now I shall be free
# [Duet with Luciano Pavarotti:]
# I can't control this flesh and blood
# That's wrapped around my bones
# It moves beneath me like a river
# Into the great unknown
# I stepped onto the moving stairs
# Before I could tie my shoes
# Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
# Who lived and died the blues
# La promessa non fu chiara
# S'erra solo impressa in me
# Vidi solo il gelo dentro me
# Quella notte dise a me
# Vivrem comme cavalli
# Liberi dai recinti di ferro
# Che piu non voglio
# Rinnegare i sensi
# Su dai fuggiam

# I guess you're okay
# You seem to feel better these days
# I've known you for so long
# I've seen your brightness go from blue to grey

# I've seen things through your eyes
# You think you win but in the end you lose
# And there's no second guess
# We take no second bets
# Chances are we're a long way from happiness
# Don't cover up the road to love
# With words that can't express
# The truth implies you're high and dry
# And you're a long way from happiness

# I'll take a rainy day
# To make a champagne shower

# Down a Louisiana road
# The skeletons they hung from the bushes and the trees
# But not a skull among 'em said boo to me

# Look Ma ain't life grand
# I'm a super power, I'm a handy man
# Didn't I turn out, didn't I turn out to be
# Everything you wanted Ma
# Ain't you proud of me

# To have the Midas touch
# Not your alchemist
# Making gold from rust
# Been down in Roswell
# When the Martians came
# I sailed to Mandeville

# Do you know what I mean
# Have your eyes really seen
# You say it's very hard
# To leave behind the life we knew

# Picture yourself in a boat on a river
# With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
# Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly

# Towering over your head
# Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
# And she's gone
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds
# Aaaaaah
# Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
# Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
# Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
# That grow so incredibly high
# Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
# Waiting to take you away
# Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
# And you're gone
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds
# Aaaaaah
# Picture yourself on a train in a station
# With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
# Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
# The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds
# Aaaaaah

# I can see very well
# There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
# And I can see it very well
# There's a joke and I know it very well
# It's one of those that I told you long ago
# Take my word I'm a madman don't you know
# Once a fool had a good part in the play
# If it's so would I still be here today
# It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
# They think it's very funny everything I say
# Get a load of him, he's so insane
# You better get your coat dear
# It looks like rain
# We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
# The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
# But is it in your conscience that you're after
# Another glimpse of the madman across the water
# I can see very well

# Elton John
# (Elton John/Bernie Taupin)
# Hey Nikita is it cold
# In your little corner of the world
# You could roll around the globe
# And never find a warmer soul to know
# Oh I saw you by the wall
# Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
# With eyes that looked like ice on fire
# The human heart a captive in the snow
# Chorus
# Oh Nikita you will never know, anything about my home
# I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
# Nikita I need you so
# Oh Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
# Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
# Oh no, Nikita you'll never know
# Do you ever dream of me
# Do you ever see the letters that I write
# When you look up through the wire
# Nikita do you count the stars at night
# And if there comes a time
# Guns and gates no longer hold you in
# And if you're free to make a choice
# Just look towards the west and find a friend
# Chorus
# Oh Nikita you will never know, anything about my home
# I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
# Nikita I need you so
# Oh Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
# Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
# Oh no, Nikita you'l never know
# repeat chorus
> Elton John
# Man stands in all his glory
# Sitting at the crossroads of the same old story
# Man got his make-up, wears it like a mask
# Hides inside a child, lives inside a glass
# Man breathes his own deceit
# Man worships his own defeat
# Oh I'm a man, I know what it feels like
# I'm a man, working on the living part of life
# You see through me, I understand
# But don't lose hope if you can
# Have a little faith in man
# Shakespeare's men got all the lines
# Modern man lives back in time
# Man got bravado in his big steel hands
# Runs with the wolf, sleeps with the lamb
# Man falls, cuts and bleeds
# Man stumbles on his own belief
# He's the hoax behind the thrill
# The poison arrow, the bitter pill
# Hard to swallow, hard to kill, hard to understand
# He's the light behind the hill
# The broken promise, the iron will
# Hard to kill, hard to understand

# Yell help, too many cooks and a bird in the bush, yell help
# Yell help, if your mirror busts and your cat gets cussed, yell help
# 'Cause down the road you find someone else who's looking
# Down the road you find another sweet lady cooking
# So I gotta yell help
# Yell help, some shelter from the storm like the travel agent warned
# Yell help, if you can help your superstitions they gonna keep you warm
# 'Cause down the road you find someone else who's looking
# Down the road you seen another sweet lady cooking
# So I gotta yell help
# I wish tonight wasn't Wednesday night
# I wish it wasn't the thirteenth of July, yell help
# And you're looking at the guy whose eyes can't deny
# That he wishes he were somewhere else tonight
# Well I met this woman down in New Orleans
# Lord she built just like a dream
# Even wore stockings that had seams
# And she was ugly
# Now hell I don't mind women of her kind
# I'll even pay sometimes for a woman that's ugly
# She built like a steamroller
# Just the kind to mow you over anytime
# Hey the moment might arrive
# On bourbon street
# Well the ugliest woman you'll ever meet
# But she's mine all mine and she's ugly
# So I better yell help

# Cool grass blowing up the pass
# Don't you know I'm feeling mellow
# I love your Roman nose, the way you curl your toes baby
# Make me feel so mellow
# It's the same old feeling I get when you're stealing
# Back into my bed again
# With the curtains closed and the window froze
# By the rhythm of the rain
# You make me mellow, you make me mellow
# Rocking smooth and slow
# Mellow's the feeling that we get
# Watching the coal fire glow
# You make me mellow, I make you mellow
# Wrecking the sheets real fine
# Heaven knows what you sent me Lord
# But God this is a mellow time
# Going down to the stores in town
# Getting all the things we need
# Don't forget the beer my little dear
# It helps to sow the mellow seed
# And it can't be bad, all the love I've had
# Coursing through life
# Down in the pass where the wind blows fast
# And mellow's feeling right
> Elton John
# Here am I, standing by
# To see if you still love me
# Why conceal, you still feel
# The need to push and shove me
# Take love for better, take love for worse
# But never ever take love for granted
# Make love and promise it will always be
# More than just a memory of
# Love will grow, it comes and goes
# Emotions can deceive you
# Well this I vow, here and now
# My love will never never never leave you
# Take love for better, take love for worse
# But never ever take love for granted
# Make love and promise it will always be
# Ours for all eternity
# Promise it will always be
# More than just a memory of love

# Cast a pebble on the water
# Watch the ripples gently spreading
# Tiny daughter of the Camargue
# We were meant to be together
# We were made for one another
# In a time it takes to grow up
# If only we were old enough
# Then they might leave us both alone
# So take my hand in your hand
# Say it's great to be alive
# No one's going to find us
# No matter how they try
# No one's going to find us
# It's wonderful so wild beneath the sky
# Sleeping in the open
# See the shadows softly moving
# Take a train towards the southlands
# Our time was never better
# We shall pass the sights of splendor
# On the door of a new life
# It had to happen soon I guess
# Whether it is wrong or it is right
# We learned to be so graceful
# Watching wild horses running
# And from those agile angels
# We knew the tide was turning
# For we watched as on the skyway
# The herons circled slowly
# While we mere mortals watched them fly
# Our sleepless eyes grew heavy
> Elton John
# Walk a mile in my tennis shoes
# Tina Turner gave me the highway blues
# But I don't love nobody but you honey
# I'm true rat for the things I done
# Second cousin to a son of a gun
# I'm gonna wipe out your mama if she puts me on honey
# 'Cause I'm a midnight creeper
# Ain't gonna lose no sleep over you
# When there's a nightmare I'm there
# Tempting you to blow a fuse
# Well there's no more sleeping
# When I'm midnight creeping over you
# Watch out honey, watch out honey
# Watch the things you do
# Long haired ladies well they look so fine
# Locked in my cellar full of cheap red wine
# But, I don't think those ladies they really mind honey
# I still don't know why you hate me so
# A little bit of fun never stopped no show
# Well I just want to loosen up my soul honey

# I'm not the same as I used to be
# All the things you've heard seem hard to believe
# Haven't always been good, never really been bad
# Most times I've been happy, yea sometimes I've been sad
# Sure I've made mistakes, haven't we all
# I've been loose as a cannon and dumb as a wall
# Haven't always been sober in counting my ducks
# And if I look back now I've had my share of luck
# But the change didn't come over night
# I've been searching for you all my life
# All the habits that I couldn't handle
# I've swept them under the rug
# In exchange for the sweetest addiction
# You, my elusive drug
# I'm going to stay now, I really like it here
# I may paint your picture, and I might grow a beard
# There were times I was crazy couldn't handle my life
# Don't think you'd have liked me not at any old price
# But the change didn't come over night
# I've been searching for you all my life
# All the habits that I couldn't handle
# I've swept them under the rug
# In exchange for the sweetest addiction
# You, my elusive drug
# And I've taken the pills
# I got burnt out and chilled by the cold
# But I've no regrets and that being said
# You know cheap thrills can get pretty old
# Yeah, Yeah, oh Yeah
# But the change didn't come over night
# I've been searching for you all my life

# From this day on I own my father's gun
# We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
# I laid his broken body down below the southern land
# It wouldn't do to bury him where any Yankee stands
# I'll take my horse and I'll ride the northern plain
# To wear the color of the greys and join the fight again
# I'll not rest until I know the cause is fought and won
# From this day on until I die I'll wear my father's gun
# I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
# To New Orleans well that's just fine alright
# `Cause there's fighting there and the company needs men
# So slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
# As soon as this is over we'll go home
# To plant the seeds of justice in our bones
# To watch the children growing and see the women sewing
# There'll be laughter when the bells of freedom ring

# Sometimes I feel too old to work, too young to die
# I'll drink my whisky, I'll keep smoking 'till I die

# Evil's been my motto, distrust everyone

# Never meant to be so friendly
# Never made the room look nice
# Never heed a word of warning
# Never take my own advice
# I got a brand-new problem
# Pretty and she's 5 foot 10
# I been in love three times this week
# I'm just about to fall again
# I don't want to fall in love
# Never gonna fall in love, again
# I don't want to fall in love
# Never gonna fall in love
# I'm never gonna fall in love, again
# Never meant to be so sexist
# It's so hard to overcome
# Trying hard to fight the feeling
# Lechery can be such fun
# `Cause everywhere there's lots of foxes
# And every cat I meet's a tom
# I wish she didn't make me rabid
# I wish she wouldn't turn me on
# `Cause everywhere there's lots of foxes
# And every cat I meet's a tom
# I wish she didn't make me rabid
# I wish she wouldn't turn me on

# We can spend the night right
# So honey turn out the lights
# and do it nice and slow
# Do it nice and slow
# You can work on a charm
# And tell the man in your arms
# To do it nice and slow
# Do it nice and slow
# Lying here in a way that I have always wanted
# Close to you in a scene that I have always haunted
# Time and time again we defended a right to cling to
# Our love-shy goodbyes, for broken hearts could cry
# You can do it, you can do it slow
# You can do it slow, slow, slow
# You can do it slow, slow
# Do it nice and slow
# You can turn on the heat
# To keep a man on the streets
# When you do it nice and slow
# I like it when you do it nice and slow
# You can work on a spell
# And weave your magic so well
# When you do it nice and slow
# come on and do it nice and slow
# You can do it, you can do it I know
# You can do it nice and slow
# You can do it, you can do it
# You can do it nice and slow, slow
# I like it when you do it slow, slow
# Come on and do it

# Hey Nikita is it cold
# In your little corner of the world
# You could roll around the globe
# And never find a warmer soul to know
# Oh I saw you by the wall
# Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
# With eyes that looked like ice on fire
# The human heart a captive in the snow
# Oh Nikita You will never know anything about my home
# I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
# Nikita I need you so
# Oh Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
# Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
# Oh no, Nikita you'll never know
# Do you ever dream of me
# Do you ever see the letters that I write
# When you look up through the wire
# Nikita do you count the stars at night
# And if there comes a time
# Guns and gates no longer hold you in
# And if you're free to make a choice
# Just look towards the west and find a friend

# No more Valentine's Day
# No more Christmas cards
# I've thrown them all away
# No more sequined stars
# No birthday wishes
# No more surprises
# Who needs them anyway
# No reason to get excited
# Yes I gave you everything
# I gave you earth and sky
# And everything in between
# That walks or crawls or flies
# No Easter mornings
# It's your cross now
# Keep it all for yourself
# It's overrated anyhow
# But keep my Valentine
# I'll keep my bleeding heart
# Just let me out of here
# Before that sentimental music starts
# And your regrets
# Fall like empty lines
# Like the lies we write on Valentines
> Elton John
# They must have loved each other once
# But that was many years ago
# And by the time I came along
# Things were already going wrong
# I felt the pain in their pretence
# The side they tried hard not to show
# But through the simple eyes of youth
# It wasn't hard to see the truth
# And in the end nobody wins
# When love begins to fall apart
# And it's the innocent who pay
# When broken dreams get in the way
# The game begins, the game nobody wins
# They must have loved each other once
# Before the magic slipped away
# And as their life became a lie
# What love remained began to die
# I used to hide beneath the sheets
# I prayed that time would find a way
# But with the passing of the years
# I watched as laughter turned to tears
# We used to love each other once
# With all the passion we possessed
# But people change as time goes by
# Some feelings grow while others die
# But if we learn from what we see
# And face the truth while we still can
# Then though the passion may be gone
# Some kind of love can still live on

# Lyrics by Tim Rice
# I once knew all the answers, I stood on certain ground
# A picture of true happiness, confidence so effortless
# No brighter could be found
# I never asked the questions that trouble me today
# I knew all there was to know, love worn lightly, put on show
# A conquest on display
# And who would have thought his love could be so good
# Not me, not me
# My secrets and my passions understood
# Not me, not me
# Who would have guessed he'd throw his world away
# To be with someone till his dying day
# Not me, not me
# I shall not envy lovers, but long for what they share
# An empty room is merciless, don't be surprised if I confess
# I need some comfort there
# And who would have thought his love could be so good
# Not me, not me
# My secrets and my passions understood
# Not me, not me
# Who would have guessed he'd throw his world away
# To be with someone till his dying day
# Not me, not me
# But not me, oh not me
> Elton John
# I want to be good, I want to be strong
# But I treated him bad, I've done him wrong
# I've taken his money, I'm given him hell
# And he takes it all 'cause he knows me well
# We can say what we mean and mean what we say
# We don't like to mess around
# But we're there to hold each other up
# When we're falling down
# Just like an old friend
# Putting me on my feet again
# Giving me back my pride then
# Letting me go
# Just like an old friend
# Putting me in my place again
# Giving me back my hope then
# Letting me know that he's an old friend
# I don't suffer no fools *I testify*
# But he must be one for being by my side
# I've broken his heart
# I've shaken his tree
# But still he doesn't want anything from a fool like me
# We won't talk for a year or two
# Maybe when we do we won't say much
# Even so we know that out of mind is never out of touch
# We're having a man-to-man
# Don't want to get sentimental
# But both of us understand
# We'll never have to say goodbye, just see you later

# I'm staring down a mile of disappearing track
# Is this the best that we could do
# I'm leaning through the rain but you ain't looking back
# What did I ever have to prove
# `Cause it feels like electricity hitting an open field
# When am I ever gonna to learn
# Married life's two people trying to grab the wheel
# Oh and we must have got lost
# Living on Dark Street
# Looking for an exit
# Sleeping on the concrete
# You can't see it with your eyes
# You can't find it with your feet
# All I know is that we're lost baby
# And we're living on Dark Street
# All the layoffs and the pay cuts cripple me inside
# I pay the price for living everyday
# Trying to keep us all together along with a little pride
# What'll it take to make you stay
# But I've dreamed about an island
# And all I got's a bucket of sand
# I'd give my eyes to give you all your dreams
# Now I get to see my family slipping through my hands

# Saw a Cadillac for the first time yesterday
# I'd always seen horses, buggies, bales of hay
# 'Cause progress here don't move with modern times
# There's nothing to steal
# So there's not a great deal of crime
# It sure is hell living in a one horse town
# There's half a mile of Alabama mud bed ground
# Nothing much doing of an afternoon
# Unless you're sitting in a rocking chair just picking a tune
# And they ain't too well acquainted with the stars and stripes
# But if you want to hear Susanna then they'll pick all night
# They'll pick all night
# 'Cause it's no dice living in a one horse town
# Laid back, as my old coon hound
# And I just can't wait to get out of this one horse town
# There's nothing to steal `cause there's simply nothing much around
# Sure is hell living in this one horse town
# There's half a mile of Alabama mud bed ground
# And I just can't wait to get out of this one horse town
# There's nothing to steal `cause there's nothing much around

# Oh, it's carnival night
# And they're stringing the lights around you
# Hanging paper angels
# Painting little devils on the roof
# Oh the furnace wind
# Is a flickering of wings about your face
# In a cloud of incense
# Yea, it smells like Heaven in this place
# I can't eat, can't sleep
# Still I hunger for you when you look at me
# That face, those eyes
# All the sinful pleasures deep inside
# Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
# Underneath my skin,
# Oh you were always my original sin
# And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
# This dangerous game
# Oh you were always my original sin
# A dream will fly
# The moment that you open up your eyes
# A dream is just a riddle
# Ghosts from every corner of your life
# Up in the balcony
# All the Romeo's are bleeding for your hand
# Blowing theater kisses
# Reciting lines they don't understand

# When will you leave, I'll never go away
# How will you breathe, you'll give me life

# For when Pinky's dreaming
# She owes the world nothing
# And her silence keeps us guessing
# Pinky's as perfect as the Fourth of July

# The trial and the error of my master plan
# Now she rolls like the dice in a poor gambler's hands
# You don't want to tell me
# But somehow you've guessed that I know
# Oh when dawn came this morning
# You discovered a feeling that burned like a flame in your soul
# For there's toast and honey
# And there's breakfast in bed on a tray
# Oh it's ten below zero
# And we're about to abandon our plans for the day

# With an elegant lady and a cafe in Paris
# Serving Pernot and Kalua with cream
# You can see it I know
# All the doors have been closed in my face
# And the drinks at the Casbah
# Run a mile or more from this place
# And oh Jessie won't you look at the planes
# Tell me, oh Jessie, is it true what they
# That there's a capital G in the name of the game
# And the runway's a home for my silver-red plane
# And won't you look at the planes
# Riding down the skyway
# Jessie ain't those wings just fine
# Don't it make you want to fly someday
# Why friend am I so still
# Tied to my job with time to kill
# Do I still bear the traces of old Don Quixote
# Tilting giants on imaginary hills

# We've been crippled in love, short changed, hung out to dry
# We've chalked on the walls a slogan or two about life
# Stood dazed in the doorway, the king and queen of clowns
# We've been flipped like a coin, both of us landing face-down
# So please, please, let me grow old with you
# After everything we've been through, what's left to prove
# so please, please, please, oh please let me grow old with you
# We've been living with sorrow, been up, down and all around
# We've buried our feelings a little too deep in the ground
# Stood dazed in the doorway, the king and queen of clowns
# We've been flipped like a coin, both of us landing face-down
# But tied to the same track, the two of us look back
# At oncoming trains ahead
# How many more times can we lay on the line
# Watching our love hang by a thread

# There's another one due in three month's time
# She'll have to paint the spare room blue
# She'll work a little overtime
# And hope it all works out for Frank and her
# If she can keep him home nights
# Away from those factory girls
# And the gas bills come and the money burns
# And Frank just keeps complaining
# How little they both earn
# And mother drops by Mondays
# Just to nag about the world
# Then she stays to nag at Dallas
# `Cause she hates those Texas girls
# Poor cow
# You'll get your dumb man
# You'll see your whole life coming at you
# In the back of his hand
# Poor cow
# It's a monkey see town
# You'll walk down the aisle
# In the hand me down gown
# Of some poor cow
# Oh them rich bitch girls
# Ain't like our lass
# Got no spine for labour
# Like us working class
# Us gamey lot
# Still got our pride
# We got our health
# It's just the truth that's died
> Elton John
# There's a porch swing in Tupelo
# In the shade of the south
# Where the sweet honey drips off that old hush-yo'-mouth
# It's a slow road on down
# That old Natchez Trace
# Through Alabama cotton fields to a state of grace
# It's a crisp golden Autumn
# On the Tennessee line
# Rolling down to Mississippi like you headed back in time
# Town's closed on Sunday
# Everybody's in church
# It's empty as the moon this place here on earth
# And this place don't change
# Some places move slow
# I'm just rocking myself on this porch swing in Tupelo
# I got nothing to do 'cept hang in the breeze
# Ghosts of the old south are all around me
# Yea swing high, yea swing low
# Here on this porch swing in Tupelo
# His mama must have loved him
# That truck drivin' boy
# With the grease monkey look and the rock 'n roll voice
# Well I was just thinkin' 'bout him
# 'Cause I guess he sat here
# Singing all praise to God through poverty's tears
# And this place don't change
# Some places move slow
# I'm just rocking myself on this porch swing in Tupelo
# I got nothing to do 'cept hang in the breeze
# Ghosts of the old south are all around me
# Yea swing high, yea swing low
# Here on this porch swing in Tupelo
# And this place don't change
# Some places move slow
# I'm just rocking' myself on this porch swing in Tupelo
# I got nothing to do 'cept hang in the breeze
# Ghosts of the old south are all around me
# Yea swing high, yea swing low
# Here on this porch swing in Tupelo
# And this place don't change
# Some places move slow
# I'm just rocking' myself on this porch swing in Tupelo
# I got nothing to do but hang in the breeze
# The ghosts of the old south all around me
# Yea swing high, yea swing low
# On this porch swing in Tupelo
# Here on this porch swing in Tupelo
# Here on this porch swing in Tupelo

# (Music by Elton John, lyrics by Bernie Taupin)
# We heard Richard Nixon say, welcome to the USA
# The common sense I sometimes lack
# Has opened up a seismic crack
# We've fallen in and I can't pull back
# And I guess we'll have to stay
# In open arms we put our trust they put us on a big red bus
# Twin spirits soaking up a dream
# Fuel to feed the press machine
# After years that were long and lean
# We're finally on our way
# [Chorus:]
# And Richard Nixon's on his knees he's sent so many overseas
# He'd like to know if you and me could help him in some way
# A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do
# A small diversion caused by two, pale kids come to play
# And we heard Richard Nixon say "welcome to the USA"
# Neither of us understood the way things ticked in Hollywood
# We just loaded in and grabbed the bat
# With little room to swing a cat
# And pretty soon we were where it's at
# Or so the papers say
# And all around us suntanned teens, beauty like we'd never seen
# Our heroes led us by the hand
# Through Brian Wilson's promised land
# Where Disney's God and he commands
# Both mice and men to stay
# [Chorus]
# In a bright red Porsche on Sunset I saw Steve McQueen
# I guess he's just about the coolest guy I've ever seen
# And for you and me that speeding car is how it's going to be
# I see no brakes just open road and lots of gasoline
# Oh we heard Richard Nixon say, welcome to the USA
# The common sense I sometimes lack
# Has opened up a seismic crack
# We've fallen in and I can't pull back
# Pale kids come to play
# And we heard Richard Nixon say, I've gotta go but you can stay
> Elton John
# Haven't you heard what's new
# There is a rumour
# Going around that suddenly I've found you
# Better believe it's true
# I got a feeling
# This is for real and nobody else will do
# You are my princess
# You make me smile
# You make my life seem worthwhile
# You are my princess
# You are the one
# You make the sun shine on me
# You're one fine lady
# You're my princess
# You're my princess
# Haven't you heard them say
# I was a prisoner
# Buried alive now suddenly I've been freed
# But love is the sweetest way
# Oh I was lonely
# And now you're the only lover that I'll ever need
> Elton John

# Lyrics by Tim Rice
# From the soundtrack "The Road To El Dorado"
# El Dorado, queen of cities
# Paradise so wisely hid
# Overshadows Barcelona
# Aragon, Castle, Madrid
# Where on Earth can match your riches
# Match your people fine and free
# Why return to old world values
# This is how the Earth should be
# El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
# El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
# El Dorado, queen of cities
# Overflowing with excess
# Every turn exotic, lavish
# Prescious wonders numberless
# Lead me now into temptation
# Surely you would not deny
# One who's come so far to find you
# All your blessings save goodbye
# El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
# El Dorado, (she could be the death of me) El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
# El Dorado, golden prison
# Sheer perfection, sheer despair
# How can one who knows such splendour
# Feel the answer lies elsewhere
# All I know is I must leave her
# Or she'll be the death of me
# Put my trust in poorer places
# Let the queen of cities be
# El Dorado, (must leave her) El Dorado (queen of cities)
# El Dorado, (sheer perfection) El Dorado
# El Dorado, (or she'll be the death of me) El Dorado
# El Dorado, (queen of cities) El Dorado
# (Must leave her) El Dorado, (queen of cities)
# El Dorado, (sheer perfection) El Dorado
# El Dorado, (or she'll be the death of me) El Dorado
# El Dorado, (queen of cities) El Dorado

# Has anybody here seen Razor Face
# I Heard he's back looking for a place to lay down
# Must be getting on
# Needs a man who's young to walk him round
# Needs a man who's young to walk him round
# Oh it must be hard for the likes of you to get by
# In a world that you just can't see through
# And it looks so cold
# How does it feel to know you can't go home
# How does it feel to know you can't go home
# Come on Razor Face my old friend
# I'll meet you down by the truck stop inn
# With a bottle of booze in the back of my car
# You're a song on the lips of an aging star
# Razor Face, oh amazing grace
# Protects you like a glove
# And I'll never learn the reason why
# I love your Razor Face
> Elton John
# Baby you're missing something in the air
# I got a name but it don't matter
# What's going on, it's cold in here
# You have a life but it's torn and tattered
# Maybe you're losing pieces of your heart
# You have a world but it stopped turning
# You lose the day and gain the dark
# Love was a fire but it stopped burning
# Spare your heart, save your soul
# Don't drag your love across the coals
# Find your feet and your fortune can be told
# Release, relax, let go
# And hey now let's recover your soul
# Lazy old sunset sinking like a tear
# Alone at night in a losing battle
# That perfect world is never clear
# You have to fight for the things that matter
> Elton John
# Well he could almost taste the money
# But he was sitting in a den of thieves
# Looking for the great awakening
# Trying to find a way to leave
# But that's when he got religion
# And the light went on inside
# He said somebody up there likes me
# Now he's working for the holy guide
# He got drunk but he don't remember
# That he'd been drinking in a bar downtown
# When he thought he heard a choir of angels
# Singing in the Tiki Lounge
# And that's when he got religion
# From no salesman on TV
# Just a tap on the shoulder in the parking lot
# He still drinks but he does believe
# Religion, you do the best you can
# We all make the same mistakes
# We're gonna wind up with the man
# Religion, oh you do the best you can
# We all make the same mistakes
# We're gonna wind up with the man
# She was silent as he paid her
# But the thanks she got was next to none
# And as her car pulled out of the motel
# She felt the presence of someone
# And that's when she got religion
# In the front of a compact Ford
# Just a gentle voice on the stereo
# Now she's a working girl who loves the lord
> Elton John
# It's a hot summer night in the blackboard jungle
# Crime sits heavy on the city shoulder
# Can't get no work, I can't get a job
# I just sit and play my radio in the parking lot
# Well they're breaking down doors in foreign countries
# Everybody thinks somebody's hiding something
# There's talk on the street and the nation is worried
# But you can't talk back when you're dead, when you're dead and
# buried
# And Everybody's restless
# Everybody's scared
# Everybody's looking for something that just ain't there
# Everybody's restless
# Everybody's scared, they think we're all in danger
# Everyone's taking cover from someone else's anger
# The walls have ears, Big Brother's watching
# They tell us that we're poisoned from everything that we're
# touching
# Well we could be children from the way we're acting
# We feed ourselves lies and then we scream for action
# We just breed and we lose our nerve
# And there's bombs going off in every corner of the world
> Elton John
# It's paradise here where the sun meets the sea
# There's nothing to fear and so much to be
# But soon I must go, say goodbye to it all
# That homeland of mine is beginning to call
# Goodbye doesn't mean this has to be the end
# Fading dreams grow cold as ice
# And I got a feeling we will meet again
# When we return to paradise
# The wind in our hair and the sun in our eyes
# There's no need for tears and no time for lies
# So reach out your hand and I'll reach out my heart
# Remember me while we are apart
# I'm heading homeward
# Leaving sunshine and heading for rain
# But we'll return to paradise again
> Elton John
# If anyone should see me making it down the highway
# Breaking all the laws of the land
# Well don't you try to stop me
# I'm going her way
# And that's the way I'm sure she had it planned
# Well that's my Rock-and-roll Madonna
# She's always been a lady of the road
# Well everybody wants her
# But no one ever gets her
# Well the freeway is the only way she knows
# Well if she would only slow down for a short time
# I'd get to know her just before she leaves
# But she's got some fascination for that two wheel combination
# And I swear it's going to be the death of me
> Elton John
# She packed my bags last night pre-flight
# Zero hour nine a.m.
# And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
# I miss the earth so much I miss my wife
# It's lonely out in space
# On such a timeless flight
# And I think it's gonna be a long long time
# Till touch down brings me round again to find
# I'm not the man they think I am at home
# Oh no no no I'm a rocket man
# Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone
# Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
# In fact it's cold as hell
# And there's no one there to raise them if you did
# And all this science I don't understand
# It's just my job five days a week
# A rocket man, a rocket man
# And I think it's gonna be a long long time...
> Elton John
# We've moved on six miles from where we were yesterday
# And yesterday is but a long long ways away
# So we'll camp out tonight beneath the bright starlight
# And forget rotten peaches and the places we've stayed
# I left from the dockland two years ago now
# Made my way over on the S.S. Marie
# And I've always had trouble wherever I've settled
# Rotten peaches are all that I see
# Rotten peaches rotting in the sun
# Seems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun
# Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one
# Rotten peaches rotting in the sun
# There ain't no green grass in a U.S. state prison
# There is no one to hold when you're sick for your wife
# And each day out you'll pick, you'll pick rotten peaches
# You'll pick rotten peaches for the rest of your life
# Oh I've had me my fill of cocaine and pills
# For I lie in the light of the Lord
# And my home is ten thousand, ten thousand miles away
# And I guess I won't see it no more
> Elton John
# Sometimes you dream, sometimes it seems
# There's nothing there at all
# You just seem older than yesterday
# And you're waiting for tomorrow to call
# You draw to the curtain and one thing's for certain
# You're cozy in your little room
# The carpet's all paid for, God bless the TV
# Let's go shoot a hole in the moon
# And Roy Rogers is riding tonight
# Returning to our silver screens
# Comic book characters never grow old
# Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
# Oh the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
# Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
# Turn on the T.V., shut out the lights
# Roy Rogers is riding tonight
# Nine o'clock mornings, five o'clock evenings
# I'd liven the pace if I could
# Oh I'd rather have a ham in my sandwich than cheese
# But complaining wouldn't do any good
# Lay back in my armchair, close eyes and think clear
# I can hear hoofbeats ahead
# Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop
# While the wife and the kids are in bed
> Elton John
# There's a hungry road I can only hope's
# Gonna eat me up inside
# There's a drifting spirit coming clean
# In the eye of a lifelong fire
# Tell Monday I'll be around next week
# I'm running ahead of my days
# In the shotgun chance that scattered us
# I've seen the error of my ways
# Well we've wrapped ourselves in golden crowns
# Like sun gods spitting rain
# Found a way home written on this map
# Like red dye in my veins
# In the hardest times that come around
# The fear of losing grows
# I've lost and seen the world shut down
# It's a darkness no one knows
# And I've poured out the pleasure and dealt with the pain
# Standing in a station waiting in the rain
# I'm starting to feel a little muscle again
# But love is lost like a runaway train
# Oh I'm out of control and out of my hands
# I'm tearing like a demon through no man's land
# Trying to get a grip on my life again
# Nothing hits harder than a runaway train
> Elton John
# It's a human sign
# When things go wrong
# When the scent of her lingers
# And temptation's strong
# Into the boundary
# Of each married man
# Sweet deceit comes calling
# And negativity lands
# Cold cold heart
# Hard done by you
# Some things look better baby
# Just passing through
# And it's no sacrifice
# Just a simple word
# It's two hearts living
# In two separate worlds
# But it's no sacrifice
# No sacrifice
# It's no sacrifice at all
# Mutual misunderstanding
# After the fact
# Sensitivity builds a prison
# In the final act
# We lose direction
# No stone unturned
# No tears to damn you
# When jealousy burns
> Elton John
# Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
# And ironing out the rough spots
# Is the hardest part when memories remain
# And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
# Cause from the lips of some old singer
# We can share the troubles we already know
# Turn them on, turn them on
# Turn on those sad songs
# When all hope is gone
# Why don't you tune in and turn them on
# They reach into your room
# Just feel their gentle touch
# When all hope is gone
# Sad songs say so much
# If someone else is suffering enough to write it down
# When every single word makes sense
# Then it's easier to have those songs around
# The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
# and it feels so good to hurt so bad
# And suffer just enough to sing the blues
# Sad songs, they say
# Sad songs, they say
# Sad songs, they say
# Sad songs, they say so much
> Elton John
# I viewed in my presence
# My hand on my forehead
# And sighting the liners
# Of mad merchant seamen
# In search of the living
# Or the spices of China
# Lucy walked gently
# Between the damp barrels
# And shut out my eyes
# With the width of her fingers
# Said she'd guessed the number
# Of bales in the back room
# While the seagulls were screaming
# Lucy was eating
# Then we hauled up our colors
# The way the mother had told us
# And together we just watched the sails
# Lucy I said
# In a passage of cotton kegs
# Can we hold hands
# I'm sure that it's warmer
# Then the gulls ate the crumbs
# Of Lucy's sandwich
> Elton John
# I have to say my friends
# This road goes a long, long way
# And if we're going to find the end
# We're gonna need a helping hand
# I have to say my friends
# We're looking for a light ahead
# In the distance a candle burns
# Salvation keeps the hungry children fed
# It's gotta take a lot of salvation
# What we need are willing hands
# You must feel the sweat in your eyes
# You must understand salvation
# A chance to put the devil down
# Without the fear of hell
# Salvation spreads the gospel round
# And free you from yourself
> Elton John
# You've a certain sartorial eloquence
# And a style that's almost of your own
# You've got the knack of being so laid-back
# It's like talking to the great Unknown
# You've got a self-sufficient swept-back hairdo
# Pretty certain that you've got it made
# Oh your life-style shows in the clothes you chose
# Sitting pretty in the masquerade
# Sing it
# Don't you wanna play this game no more
# Don't you wanna play no more
# Don't you wanna play this game no more
# Don't you wanna play no more
# You remain the only main contender
# Though you never, you never meant to lose at all
# Down at the mouth yet unsurrounded
# Adamant before the fall
# Though when you go you know I might be lonesome
# But I'll keep it under close control
# Go and get your kicks and babe let's call it quits
# I believe I'm feeling indisposed
# Don't you wanna play this game no more
# When you go you know I might be lonesome
# But I'll keep it under close control
# Go and get your kicks and babe let's call it quits
# I believe I'm feeling indisposed
> Elton John
# It's getting late have you seen my mates
# Ma tell me when the boys get here
# It's seven o'clock and I want to rock
# Want to get a belly full of beer
# My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
# And my old lady she don't care
# My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
# A handful of grease in her hair
# Don't give us none of your aggravation
# We had it with your discipline
# Saturday night's alright for fighting
# Get a little action in
# Get about as oiled as a diesel train
# Gonna set this dance alight
# `Cause Saturday night's the night I like
# Saturday night's alright alright alright
# Well they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
# I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
# I may use a little muscle to get what I need
# I may sink a little drink and shout out "She's with me!"
# A couple of the sound that I really like
# Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
# I'm a juvenile product of the working class
# Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

# Released as a UK B-side in September, 1973
# When I was a boy I had a lot of fun
# I lived by the sea, I was a fisherman's son
# My mother she was a fisherman's wife
# She was scrubbing floors most of her life
# They said screw you
# I ain't got nothing to lose
# I could paper a matchbox
# With the money I use
# At the school I attended I got into fights
# I was beaten in an alley on a cold winter night
# The teachers cared less for the blood in our veins
# They got most of their thrills out of using a cane
# They said screw you
# Oh you bloody young fools
# I could get more sense
# Out of the back end of a mule
# So you see there's man who get paid for being slaves
# And men who get paid for being free
# And there's men behind bars who pray for the light
# And men in the suburbs who pray for the night
# And they're all trying to climb to the top of the mine
# And all of them say most of the way
# Screw you
# I worked in the mill from seven till nine
# Tears in my eyes nearly drove me half-blind
# Trying to make wages that weren't even there
# Taking hell from a foreman with the build of a bear
# He said screw you
# This is all you'll ever do
# It's the only existence for someone like you

# Available on the soundtrack Friends
# For our world, the circle turns again
# Throughout the year we've seen the seasons change
# It's meant a lot to me to start anew
# Oh the winter's cold but I'm so warm with you
# Out there there's not a sound to be heard
# And the seasons seem to sleep upon their words
# As the waters freeze up with the summer's end
# Oh it's funny how young lovers start as friends
# Yes it's funny how young lovers start as friends

# Lady luck and four leaf clovers
# Won't ease this hurt I feel all over
# My life was one special occasion
# `Til your leaving dampened the situation
# Well well well
# Standing on shakey ground
# Ever since you put me down
# Standing on shakey ground
# Ever since you put me down
# My car got repossessed this morning
# Harder times I haven't seen in years
# Girl you better throw me a life preserver
# `Cause I'm about to drown in my own tears
# Well well well
# Standing on shakey ground
# Ever since you put me down
# Standing on shakey ground
# Ever since you put me down
# Well well well

# Oh my love
# I have cursed the stars above
# That lead my heart to you
# But as hard as I try
# Still my love will not die
# And the stars still shine on through
# And the stars still shine on through
# Oh my dear
# Now this ship's too hard to steer
# The tide has turned, turned on you
# I have been through the lies
# That I've seen in your eyes
# But the truth still shines on through
# But the truth it still shines, shines on through
# So shine, shine on through the days we have to fill
# Though we took our love so daringly
# And gave it up uncaringly
# There are feelings left not even we can kill
# Oh my friend
# So at last we reach the end
# The lights go down on cue
# I have wasted my time
# But it tasted oh so fine
# That my love still shines, shines on through
# And my love still shines, shines on you

# Now it was just like Frankie and Johnny
# And it was just like Stagger Lee
# Dolly Summers was a simple girl
# From a mid-west family
# With a stucco home and her own Mustang
# And a charge account at Sears
# She had everything that a girl could want
# To live happy for the rest of her years
# But the thing that she wanted most of all
# Was the thing that she had lost
# To the arms of a downtown black jack hustler
# By the name of Candyfloss
# They'd slipped town on a late night train
# Heading for the West
# Dolly slipped behind the wheel of her Mustang
# With a piece between her breast
# If it seemed just like a movie
# Or a night of bad TV
# They should have had a picture of Dolly's face
# As she drove across the country
# With daggers drawn for her fallen man
# An venom in her heart
# It was nearly dawn when she caught them up
# Making out in a picnic park
# But the thing that shook her rigid
# As she fumbled for her gun
# Was the state of the man that she'd married once
# And thought of as the only one
# And as she looked back on the chances
# That she'd passed up at home
# Well she quietly dumped pistol in a ditch
# And she headed home alone

# Released as a UK B-side in May, 1974
# Ooh she said the croud just loved you
# My name's Angel and I'm sixteen
# I really love your band and your funny accent
# Sure would like a cruise in your limousine
# Then she said how about a rubdown
# You're so cute, I'm so mean
# The way you hold your guitar really gets me
# I can show you tricks that you ain't never seen
# Sick City, nobody to love you
# Oh but sometimes I can taste you when I'm feeling weak
# Sick City, isn't it a pity
# That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
# Oh, Sick City
# Hey man how's about a handout
# All you dudes just loaded down
# Just a little sugar man makes me sweeter
# I like to sit at home and watch the world go round
# Stage-door monkey's on my back
# Begging me to save his life
# Can't he understand we're not a healing show
# We're just here to play some music for the kids tonight

# There's a breakdown on the runway
# And the timeless flights are gone
# I'm a year ahead of myself these days
# And I'm locomotive strong
# My city spread like cannon fire
# In a yellow nervous state
# I can't cut the ties that bind me
# To horoscopes and fate
# And I won't break and I won't bend
# But someday soon we'll sail away
# To innocence and the bitter end
# And I won't break and I won't bend
# And with the last breath we ever take
# We're gonna get back to the simple life again
# When we break out of this blindfold
# I'm gonna take you from this place
# Until we're free from this ball and chain
# I'm still hard behind the eight
# My city beats like hammered steel
# On a shallow cruel rock
# If we could walk proud after midnight
# We'd never have to stop
> Elton John
# The mother of invention made it good for me
# Tighter in the rear
# Longer in the seam
# Kicked out yards of leather
# Wrapped around her waist
# Trimmed it to perfection
# And left a little space
# Yeah they got competition now
# All across the world
# But there ain't been no looking back
# Since God invented girls
# Now I know what Brian Wilson meant
# Every time I step outside
# I see what Heaven sent
# There may be seven wonders
# Created for this world
# But one is all we need
# Since God invented girls
# Higher on the heel, paler than pure cream
# Leaner on the sidewalk
# Cutting through the steam
# After claws and feathers
# He took skin and bone
# Shaped it like an hourglass
# And made the angels moan
# Oh here's a little heat boys
# To straighten out them curls
# Now there ain't been no angels round
# Since God invented girls

# Who'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age
# When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave
# And se&ntildeorita play guitar, play it just for you
# My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through
# You've hung up your great coat and you've laid down your gun
# You know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun
# And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
# I've no wish to be living sixty years on
# Yes I'll sit with you and talk let your eyes relive again
# I know my vintage prayers would be very much the same
# And Magdelena plays the organ, plays it just for you
# Your choral lamp that burns so low when you are passing through
# And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
# I've no wish to be living sixty years on
> Elton John
# Turn me loose from your hands
# Let me fly to distant lands
# Over green fields, trees and mountains
# Flowers and forest fountains
# Home along the lanes of the skyway
# For this dark and lonely room
# Projects a shadow cast in gloom
# And my eyes are mirrors
# Of the world outside
# Thinking of the way
# That the wind can turn the tide
# And these shadows turn
# From purple into grey
# For just a Skyline Pigeon
# Dreaming of the open
# Waiting for the day
# He can spread his wings
# And fly away again
# Fly away skyline pigeon fly
# Towards the dreams
# You've left so very far behind
# Just let me wake up in the morning
# To the smell of new mown hay
# To laugh and cry, to live and die
# In the brightness of my day
# I want to hear the pealing bells
# Of distant churches sing
# But most of all please free me
# From this aching metal ring
# And open out this cage towards the sun
> Elton John
# There's a river running sweat right through our land
# Driven by a man with a bullwhip in his hand
# And I've taken just as much as I can stand
# Oh we've got to free our brothers from their shackles if we can
# Most nights I have to watch my woman cry
# Every day I watch the colonel smile
# His painted ladies riding in from town
# I swear one day I'm gonna burn that whore house to the ground
# Slave, slave
# To fight the violence we must be brave
# Hold on strong to the love God gave
# Slave
# There's a rumor of a war that's yet to come
# That may free our families and our sons
# It may lay green lands to barren wastes
# The price of release is a bitter blow to face
> Elton John
# Like a thief he's come, like a thief he's gone
# He's stolen your tears one by one
# You're proud to love him, it's a foolish sign
# You're a broken heart at the scene of the crime
# And the night drags on, and the fever burns
# Come to your senses, everybody learns
# You sleep in sweet fire lost and blue
# You're an empty doll in the power of a fool
# Don't go sleeping with the past
# Don't go praying he'll come back
# Take a deep breath and deny
# You could love a man like that
# Don't go sleeping with the past
# Don't go waking with a dream
# There's no tenderness that's left
# In the cracks you step between
# If it looks like rain, if it makes no sound
# It's an echo of pain on common ground
# Love's like a junkie, addiction's a fact
# Passion's a monkey you can't keep off your back
# But he takes love and he turns it cold
# He's just an iceman honey, ain't got no heart of gold
# But he sees you and he runs from you
# Come on and shake this shadow that you're clinging to
# And he'll hurt you
# And he'll run from you
# Come on and shake this shadow that you're clinging to
> Elton John
# Hey there Georgie got a couple of things to say
# One you're my friend, and two it's hurting me
# Seeing you act this way
# But my hands are tied and I can only try to talk you out of a fall
# `Cause the reputation of the woman you're dating's
# About as nasty as the Berlin wall
# Slow down Georgie she's poison
# Man you've got to watch yourself
# She's gonna get in your head, she's gonna crawl in your bed
# You're just a stepping stone for someone else
# Slow down Georgie she's poison
# She's just another divorcee
# An undercover lover of a hundred
# Other little fish in the sea
# You better cut her loose before she gets her hooks in you
# If you give her the world, and it was covered in pearls
# She'd only ask for the moon
# She's got you hypnotised, with her big brown eyes
# And a body that could stop a clock
# But if you think your face ain't gonna be replaced
# Georgie boy you're in for a shock
# Well it ain't my job to rain on your parade
# But if the chips were down, you'd do the same for me
# It's always been that way
# She's got you paralysed with a pack of lies
# About honour and the single girl
# And if you buy that line you must be out of your mind
# You must be living in another world
> Elton John
# My bulldog is barking in the backyard
# Enough to raise a dead man from his grave
# And I can't concentrate on what I'm doing
# Disturbance going to crucify my days
# And the days they get longer and longer
# And the nighttime is a time of little use
# For I just get ugly and older
# I get juiced on Mateus and just hang loose
# And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
# I get bombed for dinner time and tea
# I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
# I'm a genuine example of a social disease
# My landlady lives in a caravan
# Well that is when she isn't in my arms
# And it seems I pay the rent in human kindness
# But my liquor also helps to grease her palms
# And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
# And they're falling apart at the seams
# Well I just get high on tequila
# And see visions of vineyards in my dreams
> Elton John
# Oh ma cameo molesting
# Kee pa a poorer for tea

# (From the "El Dorado" Soundrack)
# Some day out of the blue
# In a crowded street or a deserted square
# I'll turn and I'll see you
# As if our love were new
# Some day we can start again, some day soon
# Here comes the night
# Here come the memories
# Lost in your arms
# Down in the foreign fields
# Not so long ago
# Seems like eternity
# Those sweet afternoons
# Still capture me
# I still believe
# I still put faith in us
# We had it all and watched it slip away
# Where are we now
# Not where we want to be
# Those hot afternoons
# Still follow me
# Some day out of the blue
# Maybe years from now
# Or tomorrow night
# I'll turn and I'll see you
# As if we always knew
# Some day we would live again, some day soon
# I still believe
# I still put faith in us

# When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
# The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
# Prima Donna lord you really should have been there
# Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair
# And it's one more beer and I don't hear you anymore
# We've all gone crazy lately
# My friends out there rolling round the basement floor
# And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear
# You almost had your hooks in me didn't you dear
# You nearly had me roped and tied
# Altar-bound, hypnotized
# Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
# You're a butterfly
# And butterflies are free to fly
# Fly away, high away, bye bye
# I never realized the passing hours of evening showers
# A slip noose hanging in my darkest dreams
# I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
# Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
# It's four o'clock in the morning
# Damn it listen to me good
# I'm sleeping with myself tonight
# Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive
# And I would have walked head on into the deep end of the river
# Clinging to your stocks and bonds
# Paying your H.P. demands forever
# They're coming in the morning with a truck to take me home
# Someone saved my life tonight, someone saved my life tonight
# Someone saved my life tonight, someone saved my life tonight
# Someone saved my life tonight
# So save your strength and run the field you play alone
> Elton John
# I'll catch the tramline in the morning
# With your leave Van Bushell said
# He had further heard the cock crow
# As he stumbled out the shed
# Then blind Joseph came towards him
# With a shotgun in his arms
# He said you'll pay me twenty dollars
# Before you leave my farm
# Van Bushell saw the hook
# Which replaced Joseph's hand
# He said now calm you down my brother
# Let's discuss this man to man
# It's no good you getting angry
# We must try to act our age
# You're pursuing your convictions
# Like some hermit in a cage
# You're the son of your father
# Try a little bit harder
# Do for me as he would do for you
# With blood and water bricks and mortar
# He built for you a home
# You're the son of your father
# So treat me as your own
# Well slowly Joseph well he lowered the rifle
# And he emptied out the shells
# Van Bushell he came towards him
# He shook his arm and wished him well
# He said now hey blind man that is fine
# But I sure can't waste my time
# So move aside and let me go my way
# I've got a train to ride
# Well Joseph turned around
# His grin was now a frown
# He said let me just refresh your mind
# Your manners boy seem hard to find
# Well there's two men lying dead as nails
# On an East Virginia farm
# For charity's an argument
# That only leads to harm
# So be careful when they're kind to you
# Don't you end up in the dirt
# Just remember what I'm saying to you
# And you likely won't get hurt
> Elton John
# What have I got to do to make you love me
# What have I got to do to make you care
# What do I do when lightning strikes me
# And I wake to find that you're not there
# What do I do to make you want me
# What have I got to do to be heard
# What do I say when it's all over
# And sorry seems to be the hardest word
# It's sad, so sad
# It's a sad, sad situation
# And it's getting more and more absurd
# It's sad, so sad
# Why can't we talk it over
# Oh it seems to me
# That sorry seems to be the hardest word
# What do I do to make you love me
# What have I got to do to be heard
# What do I do when lightning strikes me
# What have I got to do
# What have I got to do
# When sorry seems to be the hardest word
> Elton John
# You say today was not so easy
# Pressure tends to get the best of you
# Well don't let them break your spirit
# Keep the faith and you will come on through
# And I'll head home for the weekend
# You're tired and you know I'll understand
# Just be waiting on the front steps baby when I get there
# And take a giant step into my hands
# And slip into my soul glove
# Pull it on we got a tight fit
# Never take it off
# And baby if the seam's rough
# And honey if the skin's soft
# You and me we go together
# Oh like a soul glove
# Look at me don't you believe me
# Cheating hangs a noose around your neck
# To shave in someone else's mirror
# Is one desire I haven't dreamed of yet
# But I'll head home for the weekend
# You're tired and you know I'll understand
# Just be waiting on the front steps baby when I get there
# And take a giant step into my hands
> Elton John
# I don't want to worry you none but I got the hurt on the run
# I just cut out the poison that was in me so long
# Watching you tear out my heart only gave me the last laugh
# Watching you tear out your hair is gonna be the best part
# Oh I've been shaken down by a spiteful child
# I've slapped a worried frown on that evil smile
# I've been taken down by a spiteful child
# I've turned the tables round and it drives you wild
# Oh you spiteful child
# You'd better be ready to run, now I've got you under the gun
# I put my money on vengeance before this race had begun
# Breaking the spirit in me only added to your conceit
# Playing you at your own game is going to make it complete
# Oh I've been shaken down by a spiteful child
# Turn the tables round and it drives you wild
# Oh you spiteful child

# Night life, hot spot light
# I've gotta make them dance tonight
# Night life, hot spot light
# I really want to shine tonight
# Night life, hot spot light
# I gotta steal a heart tonight
# Night life, hot spot light
# I'll show them how to dance tonight
# I know that the competition's heavy
# I know that these guys are cool
# But I'll show this kid is more than ready
# I sure got something to prove
# Right now I'm just another guy
# I don't mean nothing to them
# but when they see me dance
# When they see me dance
# Right now the music's moving higher
# I feel them stepping up the beat
# These shoes will set the floor on fire
# Everybody on your feet
# You thought that you'd seen the best
# Well I can tell you, forget the rest
# When you see me dance
# When you see me dance
> Elton John
# Music by Elton John
# Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
# Released as a UK single in November, 1973
# Welcome to my Christmas song
# I'd like to thank you for the year
# So I'm sending you this Christmas card
# To say it's nice to have you here
# I'd like to sing about all the things
# Your eyes and mind can see
# So hop aboard the turntable
# Oh step into Christmas with me
# Step into Christmas
# Let's join together
# We can watch the snow fall forever and ever
# Eat, drink and be merry
# Come along with me
# Step into Christmas
# The admission's free
# Take care in all you do next year
# And keep smiling through the days
# If we can help to entertain you
# Oh we will find the ways
# So merry Christmas one and all
# There's no place I'd rather be
# Than asking you if you'd oblige
# Stepping into Christmas with me
> Elton John
# Say what you will but I'm a stinker
# I come crawling up out of my hole
# Dirt in my toes, dirt up my nose
# I'm a perfect curse to pest control
# Seeds and weeds and muddy meals
# Crawling around the earth
# Down in the ground where the sun don't pound
# I hibernate in English turf
# Better believe it, I'm a stinker
# Burning vermin stink
# Watch me get as high as a heat wave honey
# Tell me what you hound dogs think
# Set in my styles with a beady eye
# I got connections with the underground
# Call me a common rodent boy
# Sitting here safe and sound
# Some mole hill mother sauntered by
# Acting like the ace of spades
# Don't give that cutey no reason to shoot me
# When I'm living on the eggs she laid
> Elton John
# Help me information
# Get emotion on the line
# This war that's raging in my heart's
# Getting harder all the time
# Our painted smiles are cracking
# Our worried friends just frown
# We got a runaway train on an empty track
# That's trying to run us down
# And I'm a stone's throw from hurtin'
# Everything we put together
# Knee deep in learning about burning this bridge forever
# I'm a stone's throw, a stone's throw
# A stone's throw from hurtin'
# And I know it's never gonna get no better
# Crippled conversation hangs inside this house
# Our voices just get ugly
# When our love gets all talked out
# Your goodnight kiss ain't hungry
# Our touches don't connect
# We're just a couple of kids with a broken toy
# That our idle fingers wrecked
# Some things get broken
# When stones get thrown
# Some things get better
# When you leave what you love
# And you let what you love alone
# Some things get broken
# When stones get thrown
# Some things get better when you leave what you love
# And let what you love alone
> Elton John
# They must have had the whole thing planned
# There must have been a hundred
# If we make a stand
# I think we'll be outnumbered
# If I'd had the chance
# Then I could understand
# Why I'm a juvenile delinquent
# In an East End gang
# And if you think you've seen gasoline burning in my eyes
# Don't be alarmed, tell yourself it's good to be, it's good to be alive
# It's just another street kid on your tail
# Running on the wrong side of the rails
# With my boot lace tie and my hand-me-downs
# You know I run the toughest bunch this side of town
# Those street kids making news just being around
# I've been bottled and been brained
# Squealers can't be trusted
# If we fight tonight
# You can bet we'll all be busted
# I'd like to break away
# From the rut I'm in
# But beggars can't be choosers
# And I was born to sin
# Let's hear it for the street kids
# Making news just being around
> Elton John
# Sugar On The Floor
# Written by Kiki Dee
# Released as a UK B-side in September, 1975
# You're a stranger to me
# Then you give me your life
# I toss it to one side
# Still you're sweeter to me
# When will I be sure?
# It's warm where you are
# But my lips just don't burn
# I feel so insecure
# When you try to be kind
# Could I ask for more
# Looking at you now I know you only want to find me
# Still I need a reason to leave the past behind me
# Behind me
# There ain't no easy way
# To learn how to fly
# I hope that I can care
# When I turn around you're there
# Should I ask for more
# I feel like sugar on the floor
# I feel like sugar on the floor
> Elton John
# Looking back in anger
# On this dirty little town
# It stained your dress carved up my face
# Put a wedge between our state of grace
# Somethings so young and pretty
# Should never be released
# We place our bets we take our pick
# They wind up in the belly of the beast
# And when you can't get what you want
# You take anything you can
# So I wear this suit of wolves at night
# I slip it on how come it feels so right
# I get a hungry man
# When I can't get what I want
# I take anything I can
# I wear a suit of wolves
# Just across from Friday
# The weekend circus rolls
# I cross my heart turn on the charm
# I say my prayers between two hungry arms
# There's a string of dangerous flowers
# All around my bed
# There's some want rings and some just want
# And those who'd like to see me dead
> Elton John
# I got frostbitten in the winter
# Ice skating on the river
# With my pretty little black-eyed girl
# She'd make your darn toes curl just to see her
# I got a fringe front on my buggy
# I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
# And a pretty little black-eyed Suzie by my side
# Well she sure knows how to use me
# Pretty little black-eyed Suzie
# Playing hooky with my heart all the time
# Living with her funky family
# In a derelict old alley
# Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine
# I'm an old hayseed harp player
# I'm the hit of the county fair
# With my pretty little black-eyed girl
# Living proof as she swirls
# She's a dancer
> Elton John
# I'm back on dry land once again
# Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain
# We're all hunting honey with money to burn
# Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned
# If the boys all behave themselves here
# Well there's pretty young ladies and beer in the rear
# You won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight
# Oh the prices I charge here will see you alright
# So she lays down beside me again
# My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
# Many have used her and many still do
# There's a place in the world for a woman like you
# Oh sweet painted lady
# Seems it's always been the same
# Getting paid for being laid
# Guess that's the name of the game
# Forget us we'll have gone very soon
# Just forget we ever slept in your rooms
# And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds
# Where love's just a job and nothing is said
> Elton John
# If you feel that it's real I'm on trial
# And I'm here in your prison
# Like a coin in your mint
# I am dented and I'm spent with high treason
# Through a glass eye your throne
# Is the one danger zone
# Take me to the pilot for control
# Take me to the pilot of your soul
# Take me to the pilot
# Lead me through the chamber
# Take me to the pilot
# I am but a stranger
# Take me to the pilot
# Lead me through the chamber
# Take me to the pilot
# I am but a stranger
# Well I know he's not old
# And I'm told he's a virgin
# For he may be she
# But what I'm told is never for certain
> Elton John
# Why hello, say can I buy you another glass of beer
# Well thanks a lot that's kind of you, it's nice to know you care
# These days there's so much going on
# No one seems to want to know
# I may be just an old soldier to some
# But I know how it feels to grow old
# Yeah that's right, you can see me here most every night
# You'll always see me staring at the walls and at the lights
# Funny I remember oh it's years ago I'd say
# I'd stand at that bar with my friends who've passed away
# And drink three times the beer that I can drink today
# Yes I know how it feels to grow old
# I know what they're saying son
# There goes old man Joe again
# Well I may be mad at that I've seen enough
# To make a man go out his brains
# Well do they know what it's like
# To have a graveyard as a friend
# `Cause that's where they are boy, all of them
# Don't seem likely I'll get friends like that again
# Well it's time I moved off
# But it's been great just listening to you
# And I might even see you next time I'm passing through
# You're right there's so much going on
# No one seems to want to know
# So keep well, keep well old friend
# And have another drink on me
# Just ignore all the others you got your memories
# You got your memories
> Elton John
# I was sitting in the classroom
# Trying to look intelligent
# In case the teacher looked at me
# She was long and she was lean
# She's a middle-aged dream
# And that lady means the whole world to me
# It's a natural achievement
# Conquering my homework
# With her image pounding in my brain
# She's an inspiration
# For my graduation
# And she helps to keep the classroom sane
# Oh teacher I need you like a little child
# You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
# You give me education in the lovesick blues
# Help me get straight come out and say
# Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, Teacher I need you
# I have to write a letter
# Tell about my feelings
# Just to let her know the scene
# Focus my attention
# On some further education
# In connection with the birdies and the bees
# So I'm sitting in the classroom
# I'm looking like a zombie
# I'm waiting for the bell to ring
# I've got John Wayne stances
# I've got Erroll Flynn advances
# And it doesn't mean a doggoned thing
> Elton John
# There's a dusty old gutter he's lying in now
# He's blind and he's old
# And there's a bottle that rolls down the road
# Me I'm young and I'm so wild
# And I still feel the need
# Of your apron strings once in a while
# For there's taxi cabs hooting
# But I can't be foot-loose forever
# My suitcase it's a cheap one
# My darling she's a dear one
# My head's feeling light as a feather
# Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows
# Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows
# Long lost and lonely boy
# you're just a black sheep going home
# I want to feel your wheels of steel
# Underneath my itching heels
# Take my money
# Tell me when the whistle blows
# Part of me asked the young man for the time
# With a cool vacant stare of undue concern
# He said nine
# It's not so bad but I really do love the land
# And rather all this than those diamante lovers
# In Hyde Park holding hands
# Blowing heat through my fingers
# Trying to kill off this cold
# Will the street kids remember
# Can I still shoot a fast cue
# Has this country kid still got his soul
> Elton John
# I heard from a friend you'd been messing around
# With a cute little thing I'd been dating uptown
# Well I don't know if I like that idea much
# Well you'd better stay clear I might start acting rough
# You out of town guys sure think you're real keen
# Think all of us boys are homespun and green
# But that's wrong my friend so get this through your head
# We're tough and we're Texan with necks good and red
# So it's Ki yi yippie yi yi
# You long hairs are sure gonna die
# Our American home was clean till you came
# And kids still respected the president's name
# And the eagle still flew in the sky
# Hearts filled with national pride
# Then you came along with your drug-crazy songs
# Goddamit you're all gonna die
# How dare you sit there and drink all our beer
# Oh it's made for us workers who sweat spit and swear
# The minds of our daughters are poisoned by you
# With your communistic politics and them negro blues
# Well I'm gonna quit talking and take action now
# Run all of you fairies clean out of this town
# Oh I'm dog tired of watching you mess up our lives
# Spending the summertime naturally high
> Elton John
# And I never thought I'd feel this way
# And as far as I'm concerned
# I'm glad I got the chance to say
# That I do believe I love you
# And if I should ever go away
# Well then close your eyes and try
# To feel the way we do today
# And then if you can remember
# Keep smiling, keep shining
# Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
# That's what friends are for
# For good times and bad times
# I'll be on your side forever more
# That's what friends are for
# Well you came in loving me
# And now there's so much more I see
# And so by the way I thank you
# Oh and then for the times when we're apart
# Well then close your eyes and know
# The words are coming from my heart
# And then if you can remember
> Elton John
# Empty spaces, what are we living for
# Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
# On and on
# Does anybody know what we are looking for
# Another hero, another mindless crime
# Behind the curtain in the pantomime
# Hold the line
# Does anybody want to take it anymore
# The show must go on
# The show must go on
# Inside my heart is breaking
# My makeup may be flaking
# But my smile still stays on
# Whatever happens I'll leave it all to chance
# Another heartache another failed romance
# On and on
# Does anybody know what we are living for
# I guess I'm learning
# I must be warmer now
# I'll soon be turning
# Round the corner now
# Outside the dawn is breaking
# But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
# The show must go on
# The show must go on, yeah
# Ooh inside my heart is breaking
# My makeup may be flaking
# But my smile still stays on
# My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
# Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die
# I can fly, my friends
# The show must go on, yeah
# The show must go on
# I'll face it with a grin
# I'm never giving in
# On with the show
# I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
# I have to find the will to carry on
# On with the
# On with the show
# The show must go on
> Elton John
# I'm weary and I'm staying up late
# And the rain hits my roof so hard
# You know I'm no longer thirty
# These days I'm happy to play
# One or two hands of cards
# I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
# Disturbing the peace I've found
# Fortune and fame is so fleeting
# These days I'm happy to say
# I'm amazed that I'm still around
# And the weight of the world is off my back
# When we fell, we got up
# And crawled out the cracks
# Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
# Happy today, happy to play
# With the weight of the world off of my back
# Humidity hangs like a curtain
# Oh, it fogs up my glasses sometimes
# You know I've still got my eyesight
# These days I'm happy to see
# A sunset instead of a line
# And the weight of the world is off my back
# When we fell, we got up
# And crawled out the cracks
# Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
# Happy today, happy to play
# With the weight of the world off of my back
# There's a long list of names
# That I don't recall
# Even though my memory's good
# The rain washed away
# The lemons and weeds
# When the weight of the world weighed more than it should
# I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
# Disturbing the peace I've found
# Fortune and fame is so fleeting
# These days I'm happy to say
# I'm amazed that I'm still around
# And the weight of the world is off my back
# When we fell, we got up
# And crawled out the cracks
# Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
# Happy today, happy to play
# With the weight of the world off of my back
# Happy today, happy to play
# With the weight of the world off of my back

# She threw back that shiny hair
# Like the mane on a Delta queen
# Gonna spend my last dime on a telephone call
# 'Cause she's the wildest thing I've ever seen
# She was just plain mister once
# Got herself fixed up real good
# Just a little boy lost in the land of the free
# A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood
# Now they call her the cat
# And that's a stone fact
# They took a little of this
# She got a little of that
# Now Billy got a kitty
# He got something to scratch
# So they call her, yeah they call her the cat
# She just does that double act
# She got Babs and Joan down pat
# She got hips like Mick, she's a Rolling Stone
# Never seen a woman shake like that
# She was just plain mister once
# Got herself fixed up real good
# Just a little boy lost in the land of the free
# A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood
# Now they call her the cat
# And that's a stone fact
# They took a little of this
# She got a little of that
# Now Billy got a kitty
# He got something to scratch
# So they call her, yeah they call her the cat
# She's so fine that the water line
# Don't separate hot and cold
# She got stitched up bi***y by an old M.D.
# Now she's headed out to Hollywood or so I'm told
# Now they call her the cat
# And that's a stone fact
# They took a little of this
# She got a little of that
# Now Billy got a kitty
# He got something to scratch
# So they call her, yeah they call her the cat
# And that's a stone fact

# Tune me into the wild side of life,
# I'm an innocent young child sharp as a knife,
# Take me to the garretts where the artists have died,
# Show me the court rooms where the judges have lied.
# Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine,
# Light coloured candles in dark dreary mines,
# Look in the mirror and stare at myself,
# And wonder if that's really me on the shelf.
# And each day I learn just a little bit more,
# I don't know why but I do know what for,
# If we're all going somewhere let's get there soon,
# The song's got no title just words and a tune.
# Take me down alleys where the murders are done,
# In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun,
# Want to read books in the studys of men,
# Born on the breeze and die on the wind.
# If I was an artist who paints with his eyes,
# I'd study my subject and silently cry.
# Cry for the darkenss to come down on me,
# For confusion to carry on turning the wheel.

# Loving you was easy
# Your love captured my heart
# You were always pleasing
# Till you tore us apart
# Said you needed both of us
# How could you be so unkind
# Then you traded love for lust
# But sooner or later I'm gonna get you
# Look out girl `cause I'm gonna fix you
# I'm gonna shake it up
# This time I'm gonna break it up
# There won't be any making up
# I'm shaking this three-way love affair
# I'm gonna shake it up
# This time I'm gonna break it up
# There won't be any making up
# I'm shaking this three-way love affair
# Sneaking out on Sunday
# You thought I didn't know
# Well early morning Monday
# Once more you didn't show
# Alibis and selfish lies
# Oh I've had my fill of them all
# You can dry your crying eyes
# I know you're faking, there's no mistaking
# Look out girl your heart might be breaking
> Elton John
# Ain't no loving tonight
# My woman says she ain't my woman
# I sure put up a fight
# To keep it right
# I used a whole lot of pride to get her
# I used a whole pack of lies and begged her
# She just threw me the key
# and said she's free
# Thunder in the night
# Thunder in the night again
# Thunder in the night again
# Thunder in the night
# Thunder in the night again
# Thunder in the night again
# Frightening lightning hit me again
# It's burning much deeper this time
# I got them storm clouds hanging right over my head
# And it's gonna rain harder this time
# Thunder, thunder
# Thunder, thunder
# Out here searching the streets
# I gotta find my woman and tell her
# I never wanted to cheat
# But she cheated me
# I never knew just how much I loved her
# I never knew till I went and lost her
# Now it's all too late
# She's gone away

# "An extremely quiet child" they called you in your school reports
# "He's always taken interest in the subjects that he's taught"
# So what was it that brought the squad car screaming up your drive
# To notify your parents of the manner in which you died
# At St. Patricks every Sunday, Father Fletcher heard your sins
# "Oh, he's unconcerned with competition he never cares to win"
# But blood stained a young hand that never held a gun
# And his parents never thought of him as their troubled son
# "Now you'll never get to Heaven" Mama said
# Remember Mama said
# Ticking, ticking
# "Grow up straight and true blue
# Run along to bed"
# Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking
# They had you holed up in a downtown bar screaming for a priest
# Some gook said "His brain's just snapped" then someone called the police
# You'd knifed a Negro waiter who had tried to calm you down
# Oh you'd pulled a gun and told them all to lay still on the ground
# Promising to hurt no one, providing they were still
# A young man tried to make a break, with tear-filled eyes you killed
# That gun butt felt so smooth and warm cradled in your palm
# Oh your childhood cried out in your head "they mean to do you harm"
# "Don't ever ride on the devil's knee" Mama said
# Remember mama said
# Ticking, ticking
# "Pay your penance well, my child
# Fear where angels tread"
# Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking
# Within an hour the news had reached the media machine
# A male caucasian with a gun had gone berserk in Queens
# The area had been sealed off, the kids sent home from school
# Fourteen people lying dead in a bar they called the Kicking Mule
# Oh they pleaded to your sanity for the sake of those inside
# "Throw out your gun, walk out slow just keep your hands held high"
# But they pumped you full of rifle shells as you stepped out the door
# Oh you danced in death like a marionette on the vengeance of the law
# "You've slept too long in silence" Mama said
# Remember Mama said
# Ticking, ticking
# "Crazy boy, you'll only wind up with strange notions in your head"
# Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

# Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
# Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
# Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
# And now she's in mine, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand
# Jesus freaks out in the street
# Handing tickets out for God
# Turning back she just laughs
# The boulevard is not that bad
# Piano man he makes his stand
# In the auditorium
# Looking on she sings the songs
# The words she knows the tune she hums
# But oh how it feels so real
# Lying here with no one near
# Only you and you can hear me
# When I say softly slowly
# Hold me closer tiny dancer
# Count the headlights on the highway
# Lay me down in sheets of linen
# you had a busy day today
# Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
# Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man

# Tonight
# Do we have to fight again
# Tonight
# I just want to go to sleep
# Turn out the light
# But you want to carry grudges
# Nine times out of ten
# I see the storm approaching
# Long before the rain starts falling
# Tonight
# Does it have to be the old thing
# Tonight
# It's late, too late
# To chase the rainbow that you're after
# I'd like to find a compromise
# And place it in your hands
# My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear
# And I cannot find the time
# Tonight
# Just let the curtains close in silence
# Tonight
# Why not approach with less defiance
# The man who'd love to see you smile
# Who'd love to see you smile

# Six o'clock alarm
# I get the wake up call
# Let that sucker jingle-jangle
# Ring right off the wall
# I'm too low for zero
# I'm too tired to work
# Tied one on with a friend last night
# And wound up losing my shirt
# I'm too low for zero
# I'm on a losing streak
# I got myself in a bad patch lately
# I can't seem to get much sleep
# I'm too low for zero
# I wind up counting sheep
# Nothing seems to make much sense
# It's all just Greek to me
# You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
# You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
# Cutting out cups of coffee
# Switching off the late night news
# Putting the cat out two hours early
# It isn't any use
# I'm too low for zero

# Did you see the first man on the moon?
# Have you seen the first light of day?
# When there wasn't someone stuck inside
# Something like the moon
# Something like a star that's lost its way
# Did you go to Dallas on that day?
# Have you been to where they broke a dream?
# Where there really isn't room for doubt
# Somehow we got lost
# And the truth is buried somewhere inbetween
# And everyone, everywhere
# Take time and dry your eyes
# 'Cause too many tears, too many tears
# Have been cried
# Just look into that beautiful blue
# That beautiful blue, blue sky
# And know too many tears, too many tears
# Have been cried
# The mystery of why they had to leave
# I'm only one of thousands saying why
# Why a balcony in Memphis Tennessee
# Seems trapped in time
# Just an angry finger pointing at the sky
# Would you wait to stand inside his shoes?
# And is the best all you have to give
# The barefoot man lived a simple life
# I guess he knew
# Something's die so other things might live
# So everyone, everywhere
# Take time and dry your eyes
# 'Cause too many tears, too many tears
# Have been cried
# Just look into that beautiful blue
# That beautiful blue, blue sky
# And know too many tears, too many tears
# Have been cried
# Oh come on everyone, everywhere
# Take time and dry your eyes
# 'Cause too many tears, too many tears
# Have been cried
# Just look into that beautiful blue
# That beautiful blue, blue sky
# And know too many tears, too many tears

# Snow, cement and ivory young towers
# Someone called us Babylon
# Those hungry hunters
# Tracking down the hours
# But where were all your shoulders when we cried
# Were the darlings on the sideline
# Dreaming up such cherished lies
# To whisper in your ear before you die
# It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
# Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
# Have a ball y'all
# See the letches crawl
# With the call girls under the table
# Watch them dig their graves
# `Cause Jesus don't save the guys
# In the tower of Babel
# Watch them dig their graves
# `Cause Jesus don't save the guys
# In the tower of Babel, no no no
# Junk, angel, this closet's always stacked
# The dealers in the basement
# Filling your prescription
# For a brand new heart attack
# But where were all your shoulders when we cried
# Were the doctors in attendance
# Saying how they felt so sick inside
# Or was it just the scalpel blade that lied

# Through a mutual agreement, we got that aching feeling
# To look up one another one more time
# Tracking down the zip codes
# Sealing down those envelopes
# Lack of communication on the telephone line
# But don't judge us by distance
# Or the difference between us
# Try to look at it with an open mind
# For where there is one room, you'll always find another
# Two rooms at the end of the world
# Well we've both ridden the wagon bit the tail off the dragon
# Borne our swords like steel knights on the highway
# Washing down the dirt roads
# Hosing off our dirty clothes
# Coming to terms with the times that we couldn't but we tried
# Where there is one room, you'll always find another
# Two rooms at the end of the world
# Door to door they would whisper, will they ever get together
# Their rooms are different temperatures I'm told
# There's a change in their thinking
# And their habits seem uneven
# But together the two of them were mining gold

# Rolling over trying to sleep
# And understanding women
# Thinking of you out there somewhere
# Looking for a new beginning
# Just let me be the final word
# In the book we haven't written
# I won't be another page
# In understanding women
# I could drive to Mexico
# On understanding women
# Throw myself against the waves
# And answer up to heaven
# How come her heart's so stubborn
# And what's so wrong with giving
# Ask the big sky talking
# About understanding women
# And I'm not just anyone who ever stood outside your door
# And I'm not any man you've ever known before
# Don't judge this picture by the frame
# Every man is not the same
# Some men reach beyond the pain
# Of understanding women

# There's nowhere in the world that I would rather be

# We'll be together, together, you and I
# For united we stand
# Divided we fall
# And if our backs should ever be against the wall
# We'll be together, together, you and I
# And if the world about you falls apart my love
# Then I'll still be here
# And if the going gets too hard along the way
# Just you call, I'll hear

# There's a place up ahead and I'm going
# Just as fast as my feet can fly
# Come away, come away if you're going
# Leave the sinking ships behind
# Come on __
# We're going up around the bend
# Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
# Better get while the getting's good
# Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
# Where the neon __ wood
# You can ponder perpetual motion
# __ your mind on a crystal day
# Always time for a good conversation
# There's an ear for what you say
# Catch a ride to the end of the highway
# And we'll meet by the big red tree
# There's a place up ahead and I'm going
# Come along, come along with me

# The seadogs have all sailed their ships
# Into the docks of dawn

# To bring their galleons
# Seek you find your place with me
# Men of iron, men of steel
# Only the brave hear the hammers ring
# In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings
# You can come to Val-hala in your own time
# Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
# Come to Val-hala in your own time
# Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
# There's long boats in the harbor
# Which arrive there every hour
# With the souls of the heroes
# Whose blood lies on the flowers
# And this heaven is the home
# Of every man who loves his sword
# And he uses it for freedom

# Is this a game are you just playing
# Will I be losing you
# Oh am I a victim of love, victim of love

# Wise men say
# It looks like rain today
# It crackled on the speakers
# And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
# For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
# Aching legs that often told us
# It's all worth it
# We all fall in love sometimes
# The full moon's bright
# And starlight filled the evening
# We wrote it and I played it
# Something happened it's so strange this feeling
# Naive notions that were childish
# Simple tunes that tried to hide it
# But when it comes
# We all fall in love sometimes
# Did we, didn't we, should we couldn't we
# I'm not sure `cause sometimes we're so blind
# Struggling through the day
# When even your best friend says
# Don't you find
# We all fall in love sometimes
# And only passing time
# Could kill the boredom we acquired
# Running with the losers for a while
# But our Empty Sky was filled with laughter
# Just before the flood
# Painting worried faces with a smile

# I'm weary and I'm staying up late
# And the rain hits my roof so hard

# I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
# Disturbing the peace I've found
# Fortune and fame is so fleeting
# These days I'm happy to say
# I'm amazed that I'm still around
# And the weight of the world is off my back
# When we fell, we got up
# And crawled out the cracks
# Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
# Happy today, happy to play
# With the weight of the world off of my back
# Humidity hangs like a curtain
# Oh, it fogs up my glasses sometimes
# You know I've still got my eyesight
# These days I'm happy to see
# A sunset instead of a line
# And the weight of the world is off my back
# When we fell, we got up
# And crawled out the cracks
# Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
# Happy today, happy to play
# With the weight of the world off of my back
# There's a long list of names
# That I don't recall

# It's hard to feel what's in your head
# Where the gas lamps grow

# Around the paper stands
# And a baby cried
# And I saw a light
# And I wondered where
# And I wondered why
# There'd be a loss of life
# Down here tonight
# Down on Western Ford Gateway
# That's a place where the dead say
# That a man lives no more
# That his fair share of days

# I took myself a blue canoe
# And I floated like a leaf
# Dazzling, dancing
# Half enchanted
# In my Merlin sleep
# Crazy was the feeling
# Restless were my eyes
# Insane they took the paddles
# My arms they paralyzed
# So where to now St. Peter
# If it's true I'm in your hands
# I may not be a Christian
# But I've done all one man can
# I understand I'm on the road
# Where all that was is gone
# So where to now St. Peter
# Show me which road I'm on
# Which road I'm on
# It took a sweet young foreign gun
# This lazy life is short
# Something for nothing always ending
# With a bad report
# Dirty was the daybreak
# Sudden was the change
# In such a silent place as this
# Beyond the rifle range
# I took myself a blue canoe

# Dust settles on a thin cloud
# Sends a fog drifting to a worn out crowd
# I've had my face in a mirror for twenty four hours
# Staring at a line of white powder
# High-priced madness pays the tab
# I've scraped too much of nothing from your plastic bag
# I'm a catatonic son of a bitch who's had
# A touch too much of white powder
# And she's a habit I can't handle
# For a reason I can't say
# I'm in love with a wild white lady
# She's as sweet as the stories say
# White powder white lady
# You're one and the same
# Come on down to my house won't you
# And hit this boy again
# Shock waves to a tired brain
# Sends that hungry lady to my door again
# She's my shelter from the storm when I feel the rain
# Entertaining white powder
# I feel I'm dry-docked and tongue-tied
# Heaven sends a stretcher for the kids to ride
# I might just escape while the others might die
# Riding on a high of white powder

# There's a light on in your window
# There's a shadow on the street
# Two silhouettes tell me it's over
# The shadow knows the shadow's me
# I won't crawl or cause you trouble
# Well that's the last thing I'll ever do
# But before I leave your life completely
# Tell me who wears these shoes, darling
# Lord knows the days just get longer
# The nights grow cold with you on my mind
# And I feel like an old jukebox
# Playing the same song all the time
# If these crazy dreams don't kill me
# It's more than I can take from you
# Not knowing where or when I'll see you
# Not knowing darling who wears these shoes
# My friends all say don't got to pieces
# I say that's fine but if I lose
# I want to know who's in my foot steps
# I want to know who wears these shoes
# My friends all think I must be crazy
# I see the facts but if it's true
# I want to know who's in my footsteps
# I want to know who wears these shoes, darling
# Oh and it's a chilling feeling
# When I can't see him
# What do I do
# When I face the two of you
> Elton John
# It's written clear across the room
# In silent words the blind could understand
# I came here to relax and find
# A sleep that soaks me up like surf and sand
# And you appear as I descend
# A soft outline all poised and feather light
# I come into the darkness now
# To conjure up a dream and close my eyes
# Don't disturb me if you dare
# Join me if you have the nerve
# I'll show you where the best of me has been
# Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
# Imagine just what we could do
# Come join me in my wicked dream
# Don't send me back to real life
# The daily grind just leaves me feeling numb
# Leave me in my wicked dream
# Where pressure cracks and beauty comes undone
> Elton John
# Music by Elton John
# Lyrics by Tim Rice
# From the soundtrack "The Road To El Dorado"
# The more I learn, the more I see
# The less the world impassions me
# The hungry heart, the roving eye
# Have come to rest, do not apply
# The frantic chase, the crazy ride
# The thrill has gone, I step aside
# I'd believe in anything were it not for you
# Showing me by just existing only this is true
# I love you, I love you without question, I love you
# The more I want the more I steal
# The more I hold the less is real
# All worldly things I follow blind
# In hope not faith was paid in kind
# The line is drawn, the change is made
# I come to you, I'm not afraid

# Wrap Her Up
# Elton John
# (Elton Jonn/Bernie Taupin)
# There are ladies, illegal X's
# Mona Lisa's, well connected
# They may be shady, English roses
# Blue blooded, turn up noses
# Money talks, see what it catches
# Postage paid, no strings attached
# She's a honey, she's a tramp
# Roaring twenties, molls and vamps
# chorus
# Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
# Wrap her up, she is all I need
# Wrap her up, I only got one chance
# Beast and beauties, but they all can dance
# Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
# Wrap her up, she is all I need
# Wrap her up, give her to me
# Wrap her up
# Is she foreign, legs eleven
# Italian girls, take me to heaven
# You pretty babies, from Paris France
# Crazy horses, love to dance
# chorus
# Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
# Wrap her up, she is all I need
# Wrap her up, I only got one chance
# Beast and beauties, but they all can dance

# I'll take her home with me, wrap her up
# She is all I need, wrap her up

# Wrap her up, give her to me
> Elton John
# (Music by Elton John, lyrics by Bernie Taupin)
# I remember it like it was yesterday
# Snow in the park and skaters on the ice
# Long black cars standing side-by-side
# Loading up the boys at night
# Turned up our collars to the chill of the wind
# Caught an innocent smile from a taxi at the lights
# Not something you'd see on a New York street
# It's such an uncommon sight
# [Chorus:]
# But I wouldn't have it any other way
# This city's got a thing about it, don't try to understand it
# New York City I'd really like to stay
# New York City I wouldn't have you
# I wouldn't have you any other way
# Oh the subway rumbled underneath
# Italian lights where Joey Gallo died
# And the man on the door down at 54's
# Letting only the pretty inside
# I'd wake with a stranger under the covers
# Late in the day and longing for the night
# Just like the snowfall there's so many bodies
# But somehow it feels so right
# [Chorus]
# And I can feel the magic
# And read a million lips
# No matter what might happen
# They'll never sink this ship

# Is there anything left
# Maybe steak and eggs
# Waking up to washing up
# Making up your bed
# Lazy days my razor blade
# Could use a better edge
# It's enough to make you laugh
# Relax in a nice cool bath
# Inspiration for navigation
# Of our new found craft
# I know you and you know me
# It's always half and half
# And we were oh oh, so you know
# Not the kind to dawdle
# Will the things we wrote today
# Sound as good tomorrow
# We will still be writing
# In approaching years
# Stifling yawns on Sundays
# As the weekends disappear
# We could stretch our legs if we'd half a mind
# But don't disturb us if you hear us trying
# To instigate the structure of another line or two
# Cause writing's lighting up
# And I like life enough to see it through

# So long, boy you can take my place
# I've got my papers, I've got my pay
# So pack my bags and I'll be on my way
# To Yellow River
# Put my gun down, the war is won
# Fill my glass high, the time has come
# I'm going back to the place that I love
# Yellow River
# Yellow River
# Yellow River is in my mind and in my eyes
# Yellow River
# Yellow River is in my blood, it's the place I love
# Got no time for explanations
# Got no time to lose
# Tomorrow night you'll find me sleeping underneath the moon
# At Yellow River
# Cannon fire lingers in my mind
# I'm so glad that I'm still alive
# And I've been gone for such a long time
# From Yellow River
# I remember the nights were cool
# I can still see the water pool
# And I remember the girl that I knew
# From Yellow River

# It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
# I'm not one of those who can easily hide
# I don't have much money but boy if I did
# I'd buy a big house where we both could live
# If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
# Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
# I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
# My gift is my song and this one's for you
# And you can tell everybody this is your song
# It may be quite simple but now that it's done
# I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
# How wonderful life is while you're in the world
# I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
# Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
# But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
# It's for people like you that keep it turned on
# So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
# You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
# Anyway the thing is what I really mean
# Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

# I am here to tell you we can never meet again
# Simple, really, isn’t it a word or two and then
# A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when
# You think of me, or speak of me, or wonder what befell
# The someone you once loved so long ago, so well
# Never want to feel as living shuffles by
# You don’t have to ask me and I did not reply
# Every moment of my life from now until I die
# I will think or dream of you or fail to understand
# How a perfect love can be confined and out of hand
# Is it written in the stars
# Are we paying for some crime
# Is that all that we are good for
# Just a stretch of mortal time
# Is this God’s experiment
# In which we have no say
# In which we’re given paradise
# But only for a day
# Nothing can be altered, oh, there is nothing to decide
# No escape, no change of heart, no any place to hide
# You are all I’ll ever want with me side and tonight
# Sometimes in my darkest thoughts I wished I never learned
# What it is to be in love and have that love returned
# Is it written in the stars
# Are we paying for some crime
# Is that all that we are good for
# Just a stretch of mortal time
# Is this God’s experiment
# In which we have no say (In which we have no say)
# In which we’re given paradise (Given paradise)
# But only for a day

# Yeah, I'm your puppet
# Walking, talking, living, loving puppet
# I'm hanging on a string girl, I'll do anything now

# What did I close in here?
# I can't remember ever shedding tears o'spite
# On this ground, cropping up the fatal frontline
# Like a soot-blackened palisade yet
# Impelled, void and abulic
# Legions delineate an omnious skyline
# As lifeless demons without soul
# These insentient hosts abide
# Engulfing war monger get away from here!
# Trod ye the path of vast deceit?
# Every piece of evidence was a lie
# The war, the threat's a hyping fake
# To move figures on the board!
# Stain bibractes ground!
# What do you see in me?
# Do you breathe-in dreams?
# What spurred you to come here?
# An oneiric picture of beeing...
# Like disaffected legions taken, lure
# I wonder what lies, what threat or promise
# Persuaded them to leave their home so far away
# ...did they really know?
# As the carnyx roared aloud
# I quaked not, yet just asked myself
# How their hearts took the bait,
# These sweetened words of bitter essence
# Face to face with nameless foes
# Scorching words, unspoken lorn
# Unheard quests remain the ashes of the dead
# Forsooth we'll bear the brunt
# Upright in life or in death
# Yet still the countless cries echo
# In silenced caves of nothing

# Nor to bow, to the laurel wreath!

# spurring the horse towards the devastating aint.
# It's the pauper that accrouches - bared indigence
# Your need should cost unnumbered lives!
# might and riches you have sought,

# False and fallacious, killing and omnivorous
# depleting the value of human life!

# We did not accept to bear the half-moon on our feet!

# Well, how does it feel, the blood on your hands?
# I hope you had a ball in effacing lives!

# Whose eyes can be so private and so proud

# May come to me from shadows of the past
# That I'll remember till the day I die

# May be the reason I survive
# The why and wherefore I'm alive
# The one I'll care for through the rough and ready years

# Lord Almighty,
# I feel my temperature rising
# Higher higher
# It's burning through to my soul
# Girl, girl, girl
# You gonna set me on fire
# My brain is flaming
# I don't know which way to go
# Your kisses lift me higher
# Like the sweet song of a choir
# You light my morning sky
# With burning love
# Ooh, ooh, ooh,
# I feel my temperature rising
# Help me, I'm flaming
# I must be a hundred and nine
# Burning, burning, burning
# And nothing can cool me
# I just might turn into smoke
# But I feel fine
# Cause your kisses lift me higher
# Like a sweet song of a choir
# And you light my morning sky
# With burning love
# It's coming closer
# The flames are reaching my body
# Please won't you help me
# I feel like I'm slipping away
# It's hard to breath
# And my chest is a-heaving
# Lord Almighty,
# I'm burning a hole where I lay
# Cause your kisses lift me higher
# Like the sweet song of a choir
# You light my morning sky
# With burning love
# With burning love
# Ah, ah, burning love
# I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
# Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
# Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
# Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love

# Cattle Call
# (sung by Elvis in concerts of the 1950s)
# [In der mir vorliegenden Version summt er nur die Melodie.]
# (Tex Owens)
# The cattle are prowlin' and the coyotes are howlin'
# Way out where the dogies bawl
# Where spurs are a-jinglin' a cowboy is singin'
# This lonesome cattle call
# Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
# Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
# Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo hoo
# Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo
# He rides in the sun, till his days work is done
# And he rounds up the cattle each fall
# Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
# Singin' his cattle call.
# For hours he will ride on the range far and wide
# When the night wind blows up a squall
# His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather
# He sings his cattle call
# Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
# Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
# Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo hoo
# Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo
# He's brown as a berry from ridin' the prairie
# And sings with an ol' western drawl
# Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
# Singin' his cattle call

# If you're in old habits
# Set in your old ways
# Changes are a-comin'
# For these are changing days
# And if your head is in the sand
# While things are goin' on
# What you need, what you need,
# What you need is a change of habit
# Now if you're in the habit
# To let your temper fly
# When you talk with people
# Who don't see eye to eye
# And if you don't believe it
# There's a newer world ahead
# What you need, what you need,
# What you need is a change of habit
# A change of habit, a change of outlook
# A change of heart, you'll be all right
# The halls of darkness
# Have doors that open
# It's never too late
# To see the light
# So if you're in the habit
# Of putting people down
# Just because they're different
# From the wrong side of town
# Well, don't count on any medals son
# They're pinning none on you
# What you need, what you need,
# What you need is a change of habit

# When shadows beckon on dim-lit avenues
# Night people hear the call
# From hidden alleys, secret rendezvous
# They come out one and all
# The city by night I'm wide awake
# It never sleeps make no mistake
# Whatever sets off the spark
# A magic glow lights the dark
# Then I'm intrigued by the sight
# Of the city by night
# Those crowded nightclubs
# Those picturesque cafes
# Are scenes no-one forgets
# And I'm enchanted, music softly plays
# By dancing silhouettes
# The city by night I'm wide awake
# It never sleeps make no mistake
# The evening's full of surprise
# It's magic opens my eyes
# And I'm intrigued by the sight
# Of the city by night
# Yeah!

# Wishing he was dead when he oughta be
# Heading for Sunday school

# Clean up your own backyard

# Acting like he's better than you and me
# Standing on the sidewalk supervising

# There was no moon but the stars were bright
# Put a big long hook on a big long pole

# You saw me crying in the chapel.
# The tears I shed were tears of joy
# I know the meaning of contentment
# Now I am happy with the Lord
# Just a plain and simple chapel
# Where humble people go to pray
# I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
# As I live from day to day
# I've searched and I've searched
# But I couldn't find
# No way on earth
# To gain peace of mind
# Now I'm happy in the chapel
# Where people are of one accord
# We gather in the chapel
# Just to sing and praise the Lord
# Ev'ry sinner looks for something
# That will put his heart at ease
# There is only one true answer
# He must get down on his knees
# Meet your neighbor in the chapel
# Join with him in tears of joy
# You'll know the meaning of contentment
# Then you'll be happy with the Lord
# You'll search and you'll search
# But you'll never find
# No way on earth
# To gain peace of mind
# Take your troubles to the chapel
# Get down on your knees and pray
# Your burdens will be lighter
# And you'll surely find the way

# Datin' is a game that grown-ups play
# Datin' means acting in a silly way
# Datin' makes girls start wiggle walking
# Datin' makes a guy start baby talking
# Dizzy like children on a merry-go-round
# Grown-ups are the biggest kids I've found
# You'd think they belong in a baby carriage
# They're doing things that lead to marriage
# But don't you laugh at what they do, oh no
# 'Cause some day you'll be datin' too
# Datin' makes a guy comb his hair just right
# His girl can mess it up when they kiss good-night
# Datin' makes you quarrel and say you'll break up
# And just because it's so much fun to make up
# Children can't wait to grow up but then
# They're datin and they're acting like kids again
# You'd think they belong in a baby carriage
# They're doing things that lead to marriage
# But don't you laugh at what they do, oh no

# And I missed my loved one so
# In the early mornin' rain

# Well I'm out here on the grass
# Where the pavement never grows
# Where the liquor tasted good

# Hear the mighty engines roar
# See the silver wing on high
# She's away and westward bound
# For above the clouds she flies
# Where the mornin' rain don't fall
# And the sun always shines
# She'll be flying over my home
# In about three hours time
# This ol' airport's got me down
# It's no earthly good to me
# 'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground
# Cold and drunk as I might be
# Can't jump a jet plane
# Like you can a freight train

# The edge of reality
# Oh I can hear strange voices echo
# Laughing with mockery
# The border line of doom I'm facing
# The edge of reality
# On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me
# The girl with the nameless face
# On the edge of reality where she overpowers me
# With fears that I can't explain
# She drove me to the point of madness
# The brink of misery
# If she's not real then I'm condemned to

# For boys and girls again.
# Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle,
# What a beautiful sight.
# Jump in bed and cover up your head,
# Because Santa Claus comes tonight.

# As I read the letters that you wrote to me
# Well it's you, it's you that I'm thinking of
# As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
# I remember our faded love
# I miss you darlin' more and more everyday
# As heaven would miss the stars above
# With every heartbeat, I still think of you
# And remember our faded love
# As I think of the past, all the pleasures that we had
# As I watch the mating of the doves
# It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
# I remember our faded love
# I miss you darlin' more and more everyday
# As heaven would miss the stars above
# With every heartbeat, I still think of you
# And remember our faded love

# I've been waiting for so long
# I just found out there's something wrong
# And there's nothing what get better if I stay
# There's no need to explain anymore
# I tried my best to love you, now I'm walking out the door
# You used me, you deceived me,
# And you never seemed to need me
# But I'll bet you won't forget me when I go
# Seems I've been lost in a dream
# Pretending that you care
# But now I've opened up my eyes
# And found it's all been just a great big fairytale
# I've been lovin' you so long
# Don't think I'd even know how to forget you
# But now the way that things have been
# I think I'm better off alone
# Than to be with you

# Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
# That you're moving on the back roads
# By the rivers of my memory and for hours
# You're just gentle on my mind
# Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
# And the junk yards and the highways come between us
# And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
# 'Cause she turned and I was gone
# I still might run in silence
# Till' the join might stain my face
# And the summer sun might burn me 'till I'm blind
# But not to where I cannot see you
# Walking in the back roads
# By the rivers flowing gently on my mind
# I dip my cup of soup from a gurgling,
# cracking cauldron in some train yard
# I'm barely runnin' cold how
# Have a dirty hat pulled low across my face
# Who cupped hands around the tin cans
# I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
# That you're wavin' from the back roads

# The old home town looks the same,
# As I step down from the train,
# And there to meet me is my mama and papa
# Down the road I look and there runs Mary
# Hair of gold and lips like cherries
# It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
# Yes, they'll all be there to meet me,
# All creatures smiling sweetly
# It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
# The old house is still standing,
# Though the paint is cracked and dry
# And there's an old oak tree that I used to play on
# Down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary
# Hair of gold and lips like cherries
# It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
# Then I awake and look around me
# Cold gray walls surround me
# And I realize that I was only dreamin'
# There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
# Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak
# Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home
# Yes, they'll all be there to meet me
# In the shadow of that old oak tree
# As they lay me beneath the green, green grass of home

# Well, I quit my job down at the car wash,
# Left my mama a goodbye note,
# By sundown I'd left Kingston,
# With my guitar under my coat,
# I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis,
# Got a room at the YMCA,
# For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights,
# Just lookin' for a place to play,
# Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire,
# But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man.
# Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis,
# I run outta money and luck,
# So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia,
# On a overloaded poultry truck,
# I thumbed on down to Panama City,
# Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars,
# Hopin' I could make myself a dollar,
# Makin' music on my guitar,
# I got the same old story at them all night piers,
# There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
# We don't need a guitar man, son
# So I slept in the hobo jungles,
# Roamed a thousand miles of track,
# Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama,
# At a club they call Big Jack's,
# A little four-piece band was jammin',
# So I took my guitar and I sat in,
# I showed 'em what a band would sound like,
# With a swingin' little guitar man.
# Show 'em, son
# If you ever take a trip down to the ocean,
# Find yourself down around Mobile,
# Make it on out to a club called Jack's,
# If you got a little time to kill,
# Just follow that crowd of people,
# You'll wind up out on his dance floor,
# Diggin' the finest little five-piece group,
# Up and down the Gulf of Mexico,
# Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band,
# Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man.
# The TV-special verse:
# Well, I came a long way from the carwash,
# Got to where I said I'd get
# Now that I'm here I know for sure
# I really ain't  got there yet
# Think I'll start all over
# Swing my guitar over my back
# I'm gonna get myself back on the track
# I'll never, never ever look back
# I'll never be more than what I am
# Wouldn't you know
# I' m a swinging little Guitar man

# Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
# Stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
# Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Good
# Who never learned to read or write at all
# But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell
# Go, go, go Johnny go, go, go Johnny, go go

# (Foley - Westpar)
# When I was a lad
# And old Shep was a pup
# Over hills and meadows we'd stray
# Just a boy and his dog
# We were both full of fun
# We grew up together that way
# I remember the time at the old swimmin' hold
# When I would have drowned beyond doubt
# But old Shep was right there
# To the rescue he came
# He jumped in and then pulled me out
# As the years fast did roll
# Old Shep he grew old
# His eyes were fast growing dim
# And one day the doctor looked at me and said
# I can do no more for him Jim
# With hands that were trembling
# I picked up my gun
# And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
# I just couldn't do it
# I wanted to run
# I wish they would shoot me instead
# He came to my side
# And looked up at me
# And laid his old head on my knee
# I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
# I cried so I scarcely could see
# Old Shep he has gone
# Where the good doggies go
# And no more with old Shep will I roam
# But if dogs have a heaven
# There's one thing I know
# Old Shep has a wonderful home

# I was down to my last cigarette
# And the clock in the window
# At a quarter to eleven
# I was watching all the people
# Passing by me going places
# Just the loneliest guy in the town
# Looking for a friendly smile
# But all I see were faces
# And then, just like the taste of milk and honey
# I found the stranger I've been looking for
# Like a wave, my cup of love was overflowing
# I knew the stranger in the crowd
# And I would be stranger no more
# The love that comes on the corner
# At a quarter to eleven
# I thought you were to good to be true
# All my life I had believed
# That angels only live in heaven
# But now, we share the taste of milk and honey
# Each day is sweeter than the day before
# My cup runned overflowing
# because the stranger in the crowd
# And I would be stranger no more
# Deep inside, my cup of love was overflowing
# I found the stranger I've been looking for

# And you can't get out the way
# Well it's you wonder will save
# You were mine and now you're mine to want
# And I knew if you'd cut the cord
# And rushed like balloons I'd fall
# It's criminal to pause
# As you basked in the season of I had it all
# And I forgot what I had sometimes
# But if everyone has their shot and moves on
# And you can't get out the way

# You can ask us
# Pushing down the relative
# Bringing out your higher self
# Think of the fine times
# Pushing down the better few

# To what the world and everything anger to
# Brace yourself with the grace of ease
# I know this world ain't what it seems.

# It's a hospital patient
# Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
# Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
# To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
# Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
# And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth
# Better call the fire department
# I've hired a arson
# To set fire to carpet
# And burn up your entire apartment
# I'm a liar to start shit (?)
# Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
# So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit
# Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
# Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg

# Eminem: Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
# None of these skills you bout to see come free
# So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
# If you ever wanna be one see
# Verse 1: Eye-Kyu
# Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right
# I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
# My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
# Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
# Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
# With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
# I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
# On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
# We elevated to new heights premeditated
# Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
# The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
# Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
# So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
# To represent my temperment
# If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
# But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
# Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now)
# Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
# My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
# At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
# I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
# And as for face clutching and touching the flows
# I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
# Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
# Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
# Defiance, no we won't have that
# You want your shit to blow up?
# Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
# And blast that shit to kingdom come
# Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
# I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
# And you all knew from Meeko
# That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
# So stop that bullshit and flow
# Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know
# Chorus: Eminem
# So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
# None of these skills you bout to see come free
# So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
# If you ever wanna be one see

# None of these skills you bout to see come free
# So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
# If you ever wanna be one see
# Verse 2: Eminem
# So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
# You don't know shit so when you see one flee
# You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
# I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
# I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
# I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
# Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
# I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
# It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
# You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
# My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
# I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
# If he's acting soft and he cowers
# He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
# You flowers got no clout with a thing
# You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
# I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
# Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
# Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
# Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
# So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
# I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
# I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
# You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their
# fingers
# But you can bring yours let's see what you got
# But don't front and never try to be what you're not
# Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
# And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack
# Chorus: Eye-Kyu
# So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
# None of these skills you just seen come free
# So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become me
# So you ain't ever gonna be one see
# Eminem: So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
# None of these skills that you just seen come free
# So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become me
# So you ain't ever gonna be one see

# Sometimes I just feel like
# Quitting I still might
# Why do I put up this fight?
# Why do I still write?
# Sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life
# Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
# And show these people what my level of skill's like
# But I'm still white
# Sometimes I just hate life
# Something ain't right
# Hit the brake lights
# Case of the stage fright
# Drawing a blank like
# (blabbering)
# It ain't my fault
# Great big eye balls
# My insides crawl
# And I clam up
# I just slam shut
# I just can't do it
# My whole manhood's just been stripped
# I have just been ripped
# So I must then get
# Off the bus then split
# Man fuck this shit
# Yo, I'm going the fuck home
# Rolling my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road
# I'm a man
# I'ma make a new plan
# Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
# Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
# Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
# And I'm gone
# I know right where I'm going
# Sorry, momma, I'm grown
# I must travel alone
# Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
# Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
# Walking these train tracks
# Tryin to regain back
# The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
# To the same plant
# And the same pants
# Tryin to chase rap
# Gotta move ASAP
# Get a new plan
# Momma's got a new man
# Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
# Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in her pad
# And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
# While she colors a big brother, a mother and dad
# Ain't no telling what really goes on in her little head
# Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
# But I keep running from something I never wanted so bad
# Sometimes I get upset cuz I ain't blew up yet
# It's like a grew up but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
# Don't got a rep, my step
# Don't got enough pep
# The pressure's too much, man I'm just tryin to do what's best
# And I try
# Sit alone and I cry
# Yo I won't tell no lie
# Not a moment goes by
# That I don't pray to the sky
# Please, I'm beggin you God
# Please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job
# Yo I hope you can hear me homie wherever you are
# Yo, I'm telling you dog I'm bailing this trailer tomorrow
# Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
# Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
# But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know
# And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
# On everything I own
# I'll make it on my own
# Off to work I go
# Back to this 8 Mile Road
# I'm a man
# Gotta make a new plan
# Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
# Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
# Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
# And I'm gone
# I know right where I'm going
# Sorry, momma, I'm grown
# I must travel alone
# Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
# Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
# You gotta live it to feel it
# You didn't, you wouldn't get it
# Or see what the big deal is
# Why it was and it still is
# To be walking this borderline of Detroit's city limits
# It's different and it's a certain significance
# A certificate of authenticity
# You'd never even see
# But it's everything to me
# It's my credibiiity
# You'd never seen, heard, smelled or met a real mc
# Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me
# But yet still unsigned
# Having a rough time
# Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
# Go to work and serve mc's in the lunch line
# When it comes crunch time
# Where did my punch lines go?
# Who must I show?
# To bust my flow
# Where must I go?
# Who must I know?
# Or am I just another crab in the bucket
# Cuz I ain't having to run with this little rabbits but fuck it
# Maybe I need a new outlet
# I'm starting to doubt shit
# I'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with
# I live like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
# At the Salvation Army trying to salvage an outfit
# And it's cold
# Trying to travel this road
# Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battling mode
# My defenses are so up
# The one thing I don't want
# Is pity from no one
# This city is no fun
# There is no sun
# And it's so dark
# Sometimes I just feel like I'm being pulled apart
# From each one of my limbs
# By each one of my friends
# It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
# Sometimes I feel like a robot
# Sometimes I just know not
# What I'm doing, I just blow, my head is a stove top
# I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
# Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
# But I've learned
# It's time for me to u-turn
# Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
# Ain't no fallin' on next time I'll meet a new girl
# I can not only play stupid or be immature
# I got every ingredient all I need is the courage
# Like I already got the beat all I need is the words
# Got the urge
# Suddenly it's a surge
# Suddenly a new burst of energy has occured
# Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
# I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
# Then I turn and cross over the median curb
# Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur
# I'm 8 Mile Road
# I'm a man
# Gotta make a new plan
# Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
# Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
# Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
# And I'm gone
# I know right where I'm going
# Sorry, momma, I'm grown

# Yeah, Renegades is back
# Em the B the sick
# It's Young, Freeway, 8 Miles, let's go
# 8 miles and running, got my 7th album droppin'
# And my 8th album comin', feedin' a thousand growlin' stomachs
# But I can rewind the calendar back, back when it was now or nothin'
# People said I would amount to nothin', that I had talent for nothin'
# Said I would succumb to violence or be silenced by your gunmen
# I could just hear the folks now, "He got what he had coming"
# Now that my eighth album's comin' everybody's smilin'
# Wantin' something, claimin' that they done something for him
# Got their Jay-Z pom poms and their whole uniform
# Claimin' they been runnin' and tellin' everybody like Martin Lawerence
# 'Bout how hot my rap performance was before I was who I was
# Claimin' that they threw it up before I threw it up
# You what? Where was you before I blew this up?
# I didn't see you in the courtroom when everybody was suin' us
# I didn't see you in all black when everybody was suitin' up
# Back on the block, gettin' it in, there wasn't no you with us
# [Chorus: Jay-Z]
# 8 miles and running, got my 7th album droppin'
# And my 8th album comin', feedin' a thousand growlin' stomachs, Free
# [Freeway]
# 6 miles and running, got my fist strip poppin'
# And my first album comin', feedin' twenty growlin' stomachs
# [Jay-Z]
# 8 miles and running, got my 7th album droppin'
# And my 8th album comin', feedin' a thousand growlin' stomachs, Free

# 6 miles and running, got my fist strip poppin'
# And my first album comin', feedin' twenty growlin' stomachs
# [Freeway]
# 6 miles and running in the Pontiac
# Six thousand eighty six, trans might shift while the engine run
# Anyone tell ya rider give me one more chance
# Hear them smokers screamin' "One more gram"
# So I'ma bring 'em one
# Homie, son, and my pop, stick close to my MOMMA
# Keep toasters for DRAMA, mix a lot with my son
# My son growin' and he learnin' a lot
# That's when them toasters will the burners will pop, brain on ya own
# Well a nigga, tell 'em niggas
# That's like the biblical scripture
# Look back, turn assault like the sin is in
# Most of ya heartless and self-centered like "Me Shaq and me Shaq"
# Set up ya brother cuz you jealous nigga
# The heat back, like you never left
# I ever rep, cops watch every step
# Six miles and running dodgin' every trap
# The rap gingerbread man, cheer us up
# You precious breath, State P the second attack
# [Chorus]
# [Jay-Z]
# Back when nobody would found he had talent, nobody would sign me
# Nobody believed in me, nobody but mommy blindly
# But how can she deny me? Me being the youngest runt
# To come up outta her tummy, she got nothin' but love for me
# When niggas would want me, the industry shunned me
# That's why I'm takin' all the industry's money
# Revenge is sweet honey, we run this
# Young is the illsest, Free is the future
# Bean's and Bleek is right now, we can see our 8 miles nigga

# [Intro - Eminem]
# WAAAAHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOO!!! {*laughs*}
# Guess who's back?!?!
# Mommy! We're home!!
# Say hello to my little friends
# DJ Muggs, Soul Assassins, Cypress Hill
# Everybody! Put your hands where my eyes can see!!!
# [Verse - Eminem]
# Everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
# Fourty fifty Samoans, they knowing when D-Bo was
# 50, Tweezy, Obie there won't be no hoe in us
# They pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
# From New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles
# We've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
# You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
# It's funny, I guess money does have its advantages
# And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
# It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
# It's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
# We just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it
# Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
# You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
# That you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it
# No one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit
# And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it
# The noise from (?) be drowned out by the crowd
# And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
# Till the club closes, and clears out
# And that's when they see you flatened
# Nobody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping
# And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
# It ain't about the music no more, it's bout trying to show off
# And it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off
# [Chorus - Eminem]
# Shit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
# We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
# Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin sprayed cause
# Hip-hop is in a state of 911
# It ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
# It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
# It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
# Cause hip-hop is in a state of 911
# [Verse - B-Real]
# Step off my holster cause shit it's getting serious
# All theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
# Thinking you coming with heat, yo son, I'm curious
# How long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us?
# Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
# Mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
# We living for real and others just making the stories up
# Allusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
# If you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
# When you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
# Got a hot one, spraying you bitches til there is none
# I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb
# Silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
# We cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches
# Your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit
# Dealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon
# [Chorus]
# about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
# We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
# Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin sprayed cause
# Hip-hop is in a state of 911
# It ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
# It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
# It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
# Cause hip-hop is in a state of 911
# [Verse - Ganxsta Ridd]
# Uh, gangsta Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
# On this shit you call hip-hop, this function is where did it
# When I - put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
# My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
# Got you - stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
# But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour
# When you - enter the business you thinking you running shit
# You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit!
# We gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
# All these - imitators parading like they some playas
# Trying to - save hip-hop the task is something greater
# Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
# Get caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
# I'm riding a - gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
# I'm in a - full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
# On an 8 Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s
# [Chorus]
# about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
# We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
# Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin sprayed cause
# Hip-hop is in a state of 911
# It ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
# It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
# It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor

# I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
# and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
# (Yuck!) Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet

# Who swallow lit roaches

# Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts
# Cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
# They never should've booted me out of reform school
# Deformed fool,takin a shit in a warm pool
# They threw me out the Ramada Inn
# I said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my god its you! Not again!)
# It all started when my mother took my bike away
# Cuz I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
# After that, It was straight to the 40 ouncers
# Slappin teachers, and jackin off in front of my counselors
# Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
# Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin
# And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead,
# He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed
# May be true, till I told this bitch in gym class
# That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast (Who Me?)
# Yeah bitch you so big you walked into big Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
# She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
# Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
# I felt the evilness and started transformin (RARRRR!)
# It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
# Grabbed that bitch by her hair
# Drug her across the ground
# And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
# Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop
# While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop
# [Chorus]
# As the World Turns
# These are the days of our lives
# These are the things that we must go through
# Day by day
# [Eminem]
# We drive around in million dollar sports cars
# While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
# Outsiders, and we suing the courts
# Cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
# Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
# Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
# Dressed like a sailor, standin by a pale of garbage
# Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch
# I met a slut and said "What up, its nice to meet ya"
# I'd like to treat ya to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
# But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month
# But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt
# But I aint got no weed, no phillies, or no papers
# Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
# So gimme all your money
# And don't try nothin funny
# Cuz you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to outrun me
# I went to grab my gun
# Thats when her ass put it on me
# Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
# I fell through the glass doors
# Started causin a scene
# Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine
# Jumped up with a broken back
# Thank god I was smokin crack all day
# And doped up off coke and smack
# All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
# Now I wanna kill her
# But so I gotta catch her first
# Ran through Rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut
# Saw the house she ran up in
# And shot her fuckin porch up
# Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
# Looked around the room
# Thats when I seen the bedroom door shut
# I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!
# You might as well come out now
# She said "Come in, its unlocked!"
# I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
# And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay porn
# She said "Come her big boy, lets get acquainted"
# I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
# She came at me at full speed, nothin could stop her
# I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
# I started to beg "No, please let go"
# But she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg roll
# With one leg left, now I'm hoppin around crippled
# I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
# Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
# Den Den Den Den Den Den, Go go gadget dick!
# Whipped that shit out, and aint no doubt about it
# It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
# I shouted "Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!"
# Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death (Ahh!! Ahhh!)
# Come here bitch!
# Come here!
# Take this motherfuckin dick!
# Bitch, come here!
# [Chorus to fade]
# And as we go along
# Throughout the days of our lives
# We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
# That we must go through
# These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere
# Every day
# Every single day the world keeps turning

# Nick I ain't never seen an ass like that
# Everytime I see that show on MTV my pee pee goes
# Doing, doing, doing
# Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
# Now they're getting older, they're starting to grow bum bums
# I go to the movies and sit down with my pop corn
# Police saying "freeze"
# Doing doing doing
# What do you mean freeze?
# Geez, I just got my seat
# I have ticket, look, I put away my zipper zipped
# Please do not remove me from this movie theater please
# I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
# I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
# And don't treat me like I'm pee wee herman, this movies PG
# Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
# I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea and be free
# Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
# What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
# I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
# And I can say that and you'll laugh cuz that is a puppet on my hand
# [Chorus]
# Hilary Duff is not quite old enough so
# I ain't never seen a butt like that
# Maybe next year I'll say ass and she'll make my pee pee go
# Doing, doing, doing
# The way she moves she dances like a go-go
# In that video she sings get out your bozo
# I need a new boyfriend, hi my name is JoJo
# Police saying "freeze"
# Doing, doing, doing
# What do you mean freeze?
# My computers would be seized and my keys to my ranch
# I just baked cookies Mr. Officer, looky, take a whiff of these
# Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
# Nobody is safe from me, no not even me
# I don't even know if I can say the word pee pee, pee
# On the radio, but I think I did
# Janet, is that a breast, I think I just saw a tit
# Psych, I joke, I joke, I kidd, I kidd
# I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
# Get to the chopper, everybody get out
# I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down
# [Chorus]
# So Gwen Stefani, will you pee pee on me please?
# I ain't never seen an ass like that
# Cuz the way you move it, you make my pee pee go
# Doing, doing, doing
# What the fuck is wrong with you? (ha!)

# My love, You were the one thing in my life
# That I treated bad
# Sometimes enough I made you cry
# And I know the way I made you feel was wrong
# (I left you sad and lonely)
# The things I did, the words I said were much too strong
# And I swear if you come back to me
# I'll do things much differently
# If you were here with me today
# This is what you'd hear me say
# Chorus:
# We could've been so good together
# Couldn't we give it just one more try?
# I thought that we would last forever
# But now you're gone and I think I know why
# I guess I should have said I am sorry
# Maybe things wouldn't be this way heaven knows I love you baby
# If you love me, baby come back to me
# All the times that I made you cry
# I'm sorry, don't you say goodbye
# I wish I had this chance to love you more
# (I love you, I love you)
# But now you're gone I can't go on
# I'm all alone
# And I swear if you come back to me
# I'll do things much differently
# If you were here with me today
# This is what you'd here me say

# Tonight I'm only thinking of you
# Feeling sorry for myself that's all I can do
# Without you here I know I'd fall apart

# (feat. Dr. Dre)
# The Wild.. Gotham
# The Wild.. West
# [*BANG BANG, BANG*]
# Ha ha, riiiiide..
# [Dr. Dre]
# All you see is the sun, reflectin off of the gun
# I'm ready for the showdown, that go down at one
# Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
# I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
# I'm polishin gold, waitin for this drama to unfold
# I got a {blunt} rolled
# Feelin bold, gangsters blood runs cold
# It's time to reload this old .45 colt
# The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
# Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
# It's passed noon, he should be here soon
# Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
# All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
# Sounds like a thousand wolves
# I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
# I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
# I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
# but I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
# And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
# I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
# [Eminem]
# You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
# but I know you - the name's Slim - you want revenge?
# Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
# I'm tellin the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you..
# [Chorus:]
# You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
# And life ain't fun, when you're on the run
# Got your gold and you got your gun
# But life as an outlaw just begun
# Got your shotgun by your side
# Got your horse and you got your pride
# You ride til there ain't no place to hide
# It's sad cause the bad guys always die
# [Dr. Dre + Eminem]
# He was "Shady," I seen by the look on his face
# He said take ten paces {shit} I took eight
# Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
# My {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
# (You need bullets, hurry up run!)
# [*imitating Slick Rick*]
# I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
# We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
# (Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want)
# I figured he was tellin the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
# So what we gon' do, it's on you
# (Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?)
# The Chronic!
# (Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two)
# (And plus I know who's got it)
# Who?
# (Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two)
# Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
# Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle
# We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
# An old ghost town that everybody forgot
# A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
# Slim grabbed the shotgun (Dre here's the plot)
# [Eminem]
# This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
# He's goin around sayin he took the game from us
# (Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin)
# But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
# He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
# Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
# Our mission - is to get him to stop layin eggs
# And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
# [Dr. Dre]
# I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
# Kicked the swingin doors in, started gun slinging
# I could hear somebody singin - it sounded like a "G Thang,"
# and a verse from "Keep Their Heads Ringin"
# I said "It's Dre's Day," and started to spray
# Against 1800, he pulls a AK
# Hollow tips started flyin every which way
# [Eminem]
# That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
# I fired the first shot, spun his body around
# He hit the ground and landed upside down
# Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
# I grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled
# [Chorus 2X]
# Always die..
# The Wild.. Gotham
# The Wild.. West

# I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
# with a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
# And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
# since the third time that I failed 9th grade
# You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
# I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon}
# I laugh at the sight of death
# as I fall down a cement flight of steps {ahhhhhhhh!}
# and land inside a bed of spider webs
# So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
# can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
# Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin mine out
# Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now!

# I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
# You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
# Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
# Sheriffs couldn't stop em
# Quickest damn gun slingers I've ever seen
# Got murdered in cold blood
# That ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from home
# They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
# And on a quiet night
# You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da Five-Nine
# [Eminem]
# I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
# I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
# I translate when my voice is read through a sismograph
# And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head (AAHHH)
# Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his bed
# Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
# Told him each one of his boys is dead
# I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said
# [Royce]
# Who hard? yo I done heard worse
# We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
# To see which one'll swerve first
# Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds
# That of a globe on top of nine other planets
# Kissed the cheek of the devil
# Intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
# Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist
# Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot
# One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
# In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse
# And stay over-worked, its like the Nazis in the nations
# Collaborating, attemptin to take over the earth
# [Eminem]
# Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
# We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
# He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal
# Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either (shit, me neither)
# We ain't eager to be legal
# So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle
# I breathe ether in three amounts
# When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
# Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
# Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
# (He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
# Cuz I can't find a decent vain
# [Royce]
# The disaster wit dreds
# I'm Bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
# To kill my soul after I'm dead
# When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
# Cuz I serve any stranger wit money
# I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
# While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
# Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
# Serve this lobbyist, strangle your body then confirm you
# Whippin human ass, throwin blows crackin jaws
# Wit my fists wrapped in gause, dipped in glue and glass
# I'm blazin MC's, at the same time amazin MC's
# Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me
# >From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche
# And bust till volcanoes errupt

# And so that's the story when Bad Meets Evil
# Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
# Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
# It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
# Got shot in the back comin out of that ol' saloon
# But their spirits still live on till this day
# Shhh...[spits] wait, did y'all hear that?
# [Footsteps and windblowing]

# (Girl) Yeah Hahahaha........whooooo,shit
# (Eminem) (aight)
# (Em) guess what? i ain't coming in yet....
# i'll come in a minute
# (Em) ayo...this is my love song...it goes like this
# Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark
# This is how we used to get the party start
# We used to mix hen' with bacardi dark
# and when it kicks in, you can hardly talk
# and by the sixth gin you're probably crawl
# and you'll be sick then and probably barf
# and my prediction is you're probably fall
# either in the lobby or the hallway wall
# and everything spinning
# you're beginnin' to think like a woman
# are swimming in pink linen
# again in the sink
# then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
# you are now allowed to officially slap bitches
# you have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
# start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
# get in your car, start it,and start drivin'
# over the island and cause a  forty-two-car pileup
# earth calling pilot to copilot
# looking for life on this planet,sir, no sigh of it
# all i can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
# and i'm so high that i might dieif go by it
# let me out of this place i'm outta place
# i'm in outer spacei've just vanished without a trace
# i'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
# i'll be back in an hour or so
# Chorus:
# 'cause every time i go to try to leave
# some geek keeps pullin' on my sleeve
# i don't wanna, but i gotta stay
# these drugs really got  a hold of me
# 'cause every time i try to tell them "no"
# they won't let me ever let them go
# i'm a sucka, all i gotta say
# these drugs really
# got a hold of me
# in third grade, all i used to do
# was sniff glue through a tube and play rubik's cube
# seventeen years later i'm still as rude as jude
# scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs
# i've got no game
# and every face looks the same
# they've got no name
# so i don't need game to play
# i just say whatever i want to whoever i want
# whenever i want, wherever i want, however i want
# however, do show some respect to few
# this ecstasy's got me standing next to you
# getting sentimental as fuck spillin'guts to you
# we just met
# but i think i'm in love with you
# but you're on it too
# so you tell me you love me too
# wkae up in the morninglike"yo, what the fuck we do?"
# i gotta go,bitch
# you know i've got stuff to do
# 'cause if i get caught cheatin',then i'm stuck with you
# but in the long run
# these drugsare probablygoing to catch upsooner or later
# but fuck it, i'm on one
# so let's enjoy
# let the X destroy your spinal cord
# so it's not a straight line no more
# till we walk around looking like some windup dolls
# shit sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
# shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
# so bye for now, i'm going to try to find some more
# Chorus
# that's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
# when you swallow it all,wallow and drown in your sorrow
# and tomorrow you're probably going to want to do it again
# what's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
# screw it
# and what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
# and what's a little fight?
# tomorrow you'll be boys again
# it's your life live it however you wanna
# marijuana is everywhere
# where was you brought up?
# it don't matter as long as you get where you're going
# 'cause none of the shit is going to mean shit where we're going
# they tell yu to stop, but you just sit there ignoring
# even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning
# but you're young
# you've got a lot of drugs to do
# girls to screw
# parties to crash
# sucks to be you
# if i could take it all back now, i wouldn't
# i would have did more shit that people said that i shouldn't
# but i'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
# to better drugs and updated
# but i've still got a lot of growing u to do
# i've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew
# but when it's all said and done i'll be forty
# before i know it with a fortyon the porch telling stories
# with a bottle of  jack
# two grandkids on my lap
# baby-sitting for hailie while hailie is out smashed

# But then again you finaly get your wish

# Fucking punk, pussy, fuck you chump
# Give me a one-on-one see if I don't fuck you up
# Try to chump the ruff ryders and they cut you up
# And you put Jada on a track,
# That's how much you suck dick in the industry

# Now he's a busta? What the fuck's with that
# Get on a track dissing us, kissing 50's ass
# And askin' me what I know about indictments, bite me!
# Bitch I got 2 cases and probation, Fight me!
# What do I know about standing in front of a judge, like a man
# Ready to take whatever sentence hands
# What you know about your wife slicing her wrists
# Right in front of the only thing you have in this world
# a little girl
# And i'll put that on her
# When this is all over
# I would never try to make her a star, and eat off her
# I dunno shit about no shopping rocks
# But what you know about hip-hop, shops, rocking spots
# When your the only white boy up in that bitch just ripping
# Pressing up your own flyers, and your stickers
# Just sticking them bitches up after spending 6 hours at kinkos
# Making copies of your covers to cassette singles
# To sell 'em out of the trunk of your Tracer
# Spending your whole pay check at discmakers
# What you know about being bullied over half your life
# Oh thats right, you should know what thats like, your half-white
# Vanilla ice, spill the beans and rice, I'm eating you alive inside, Jesus Christ!
# If it's that much of a gangsta put the mic down
# You should be out killing muthafuckas right now
# Kill a muthafucka dead, kill him dead bitch
# Shoot him in the fucking head, go ahead bitch
# Slap my mom, slap the fuck out of her
# She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of you
# Cause your broke as fuck, you suck
# Your a fucking joke , if u was really selling coke
# Well then what the fuck you stop for dummy!
# If u sleugh some crack
# You'd make alot more money than you do from rap
# You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
# You'll never know what is like to be rich, life's a bitch ain't it
# Raymond, here let me me break this shit down in laymans terms
# Terms for you just to make sure
# That you can understand it cause cannabis ain't using too many
# Complicated fucking words for ya
# Here, let me slow it down for you so that you can understand it if I say it slower
# Let it go dog its over

# Haha, talkin' about, I have muthafuckas calling your crib
# Bitch, you aint even got a fucking crib
# You don't even got a fucking phone, you fucking punk

# If I come back at you or attack you
# Bitch, you attacked me first, take it like a man and shut the fuck up
# Fuck your little magazine too, I don't need your little fucking magazine
# I got double XL's number anyways,

# I don't understand
# Why are you being so mean?
# You're mean mean man
# [Chorus]
# You are just jealous of me
# Cuz you, you just can't do what I do
# So instead of just admitting it
# You walk around and say
# All kinds of really mean things
# About me cuz you're a meanie, a meanie
# But it's only cuz you're
# Just really jealous of me
# Cuz I'm what you want to be
# So you just look like an idiot
# When you say these mean things
# Cuz it's too easy to see
# You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
# [Verse 1]
# Alright listen, I need you to focus
# I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
# We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
# I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
# Now I need you to open your mind-your eyes close them
# You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
# For the next four and a half minutes
# We are going to explore into your mind
# To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
# Now why did they make Yoo-Hoo?
# Hippity ga-ga boo-boo
# Psych, I'm kidding
# I just wanted to see if you're still listenin'
# Ok, now I need your undivided attention
# Sir I have a question
# Why do I always sense this undeniable tension
# From the moment that I enter into the room
# It gets all quiet and whispers
# Whenever theres conversation, why am I always mentioned?
# I've been dying to ask, it's been itchin' at me
# Is it just because
# [Chorus]
# [Verse 2]
# Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
# I was going to say something extremely important
# But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
# Psych, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
# That's just what you wanted to hear from me
# Is that I fucked up ain't it?
# But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper
# It doesn't take a bunch of takes
# Or me to stand here in this booth all day
# For me to say the truth, ok?
# You're droolin, you have tooth decay
# Your mouth is open, you're disgusting
# What the fuck you eat for lunch
# A bunch of sweets or something, what?
# You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch?
# Your tooth is rotten to the gum
# Your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
# Yes I do sir, what am I on?
# You sir are on truth syrum
# Marshall I'm so jealous of you
# Please say you won't tell nobody
# I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
# That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying
# All these terrible, evil and awful mean things
# It's my own insecurity!
# [Chorus]
# [Verse 3]
# Alright now we, we're going to conduct
# That experiment that we were talking about earlier
# Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
# Cuz that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?
# Here's a mirror, notice the resemblence here?
# Wait, let me put these sun glasses on
# Now look in this mirror, how about now?
# What do you have in common?
# You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
# You look like I sound like singing about weenies
# Now take my weenie out of your mouth
# This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
# I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
# Curled up in a ball tweeked out of my mind dying
# There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
# Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
# Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless
# Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is tortuous
# My point is this
# That if you say mean things, weenie will shrink
# Now I fogot what the chorus is, your just is...
# [Chorus]

# Dreamin at night and screamin' at moms schemin' to leave
# Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
# I just want you all to notice me and people to see
# That somewhere deep down is a decent human being in me
# It just can't be found so the reason you've been seeing this me
# Is cause this is me now, the recent dude is being this mean
# So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
# Or heard tha CD using tha fag word so freely
# It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down
# Suck my fuckin' dick ya faggot!
# You happy now? Look here!
# I start some trouble everywhere that I go
# Ask tha bouncers in the club cause they know
# I start some shit they throw me out the back do'
# Come back and shoot the club up wit a fo-four

# VERSE 1
# Slippin in through the back door
# Booty MC's get ambushed
# Rammed and squooshed
# Slammed and pushed
# Crammed and mushed
# Then I'm movin on down from the right to left
# So wipe the meth and prepare to fight to death
# You get jacked and tackled and cracked in two
# Smack them through 'till ya black and blue
# Or actin true
# I'm dreaded like a man who's hair is all strands
# Who's badder when sniffin on aerosol cans
# I'm stompin 'em, kickin 'em, chokin 'em, stampin 'em,
# clockin 'em, stickin 'em, pokin 'em, clampin 'em
# Who'd elect ya kids, indict their votes
# Hit 'em with vicoden doses of lighting bolts
# I'm zappin, ???
# Faster than you can snap your fingers for answers
# Cancer is in the flesh
# Alight a breather
# Survived it by the knife and the thievin
# VERSE 2
# I had a dream I was gettin jacked by biters
# It felt like I was being attacked by spiders
# Developin' a fear from biterphobia
# I'm holdin the gas can and lighter over ya
# If I detect ya
# I'ma pulverise disect ya brain
# Diggin in ya skull for lies that I'm a torture
# With material iller than a stark raid or mass serial killer

# So beware of the aura
# A terror, the horror
# Will scare ya tomorrow
# Ze-ero?? assault for rappers

# A head full of Porter
# We run or gallop on hills???
# The choice is yours
# Decipher these noisy force minutes
# Scream til my voice is hoarse
# Cuz Im sick of these debators
# That grab like repertoires and saboteurs
# And bite like Labradors
# Hear the range of my double barrel
# And your life is in danger troubled and perilled
# VERSE 3
# I can't understand flyers
# Second?? with camp fires
# Cuz vampires bite on my balls and clamp pliers
# It's swinging my big thing-a-ma-jig
# So I'm ringing my neck
# Proof will backup

# Cuz biters are fallin head over heels
# in love
# With every rhyme that I set over ears
# That's how I became paranoid
# Chewing my fingernails
# Pulling my hair annoyed

# [Doctor] Wait.. he's convulsing, he's convulsing!
# [Nurse] Ah!
# [Doctor] We're gonna have to shock him!
# [Nurse] Oh my! Oh my God!
# [Doctor] We're gonna have to shock him!
# [Nurse] Oh my God!
# [Eminem]
# These are the results of a thousand electric volts
# A neck with bolts, "Nurse we're losin him, check the pulse!"
# A kid who refused to respect adults
# Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
# A corny lookin white boy, scrawny and always ornery
# Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on me
# And I might snap, one day just like that
# I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
# (Whosssssh) My first day in junior high, this kid said,
# "It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die"
# I looked at my watch it was one twenty
# "I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?!?"
# He said, "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse..."
# My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
# Something told me, "Try to fake a stomach ache it works"
# I screamed, "Owww! My appendix feels like they could burst!
# Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!"
# [teacher] "What's the matter?"
# [Eminem] "I don't know, my leg, it hurts!"
# [teacher] "Leg?! I thought you said it was your tummy?"
# [Eminem] "Oh! I mean it is , but i also got a bum knee."
# [Teacher] "Mr.mathers the fun n games are over.
# And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework."
# [Eminem] "But don't you wanna give me after school detention?"
# [teacher] "Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and ima let him."
# Chorus: repeat 2X
# Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
# Drugs is what they used to say I was on
# They say I never knew which way I was goin
# But everywhere I go they keep playin my song
# [Eminem]
# Brain damage..
# Way before my baby daughter Hailie
# I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
# An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes
# so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
# One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin
# And had me in the position to beat me into submission
# He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose,
# Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
# I tried to plead and tell him, "We shouldn't beef"
# But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin me and I couldn't breathe
# He looked at me and said, "You gonna die honkey!"
# The principal walked in (What's going on in here?)
# and started helpin him stomp me
# I made them think they beat me to death
# Holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
# Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
# Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
# Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools
# "This is for every time you took my orange juice,
# or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk.
# Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt.
# I'm gettin you back bully! Now once and for good."
# I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
# and beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood
# Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot..
# .. Made it home, later that same day
# Started reading a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
# I couldn't even see what I was tryin to read
# I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed
# My mother started screamin, "What are you on, drugs?!?
# Look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug!" (Sorry!)
# She beat me over the head with the remote control
# opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull
# I picked it up and screamed, "Look bitch, what have you done?!?"
# [Mother] "Oh my God, I'm sorry son"
# [Eminem] "Shut up you cunt!" I said, "Fuck it!"
# Took it and stuck it back up in my head
# then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck
# Chorus
# [Eminem]
# Brain damage..
# It's brain damage..
# I got brain damage..
# It's brain damage..
# It's probably brain damage..
# It's brain damage..
# Brain damage..
# I got brain damage..

# I'm decimating the competition
# With my fucked up rendition
# Of this muthafucking song
# It's my tradition

# I ain't have to diss people

# You muthafucking assholes
# Fuck everything and pass it
# Knew I was special from

# My first hit moved straight on
# To my first hate
# And my first date
# Was as fucked up as it gets
# Passed the test
# But the bitch didn't want to get wet
# So I killed my guinea pig
# Just to up and spite her
# My fucking bitch of a mom
# Screamed and said I didn't like her
# I'm decimating the competion

# [Intro]
# Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging
# [Verse]
# I'm withholding my anger
# Though I'd like to be the strangler
# Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
# It's my right to insist
# That he acknowledge my existence
# But he just displays complete lack of respect
# That's what he says to himself
# As he uses magazines to trash me
# As he sits with both feet up at his desk
# Smokes a bag of his weed
# And starts imagining things
# And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
# And in his jealousy and envy
# It just whirls him in a frenzy
# As he turns on MTV and sees my face
# He don't exist in this world
# So he just twists and he twirls
# Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage
# And it's destroying him slowly
# Cuz he does not even know me
# Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
# So he just tortures himself
# He has no fortune and wealth
# So he extorts someone else to get his dough
# And now he's acting like a bully
# So he tries to push and pull me
# But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
# He has no choice but to scream
# And raise his voice up at me
# Cuz it annoys him to see that I ain't scared
# [Chorus]
# You aint no motherfucking (bully)
# And I aint bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
# I won't allow it, aint gon coward to no (bully)
# I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully)
# Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)
# And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...)
# [Verse]
# Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies
# No more unfortunately
# There's so many motherfuckers that just are
# They just keep pounding at me
# Now that I'm down with 50
# Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja'
# [laughter]
# But his ass is such a puppet
# Irv could shove his whole hand up it
# And just make him say what he wants him to say
# But Suge has Irv's on a string
# And Irv's so nervous that he
# Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
# So now Ja thinks that he's so tough
# And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
# And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
# But our building's made out of bricks
# So you ain't taking out shit
# I dawg you just did a song with Bobby Brown
# So now you try to pull a race card
# And it backfires in your face hard
# Cuz you know we don't play that black and white shit
# Plus this stylist that you fucked
# When you was ecstasied up
# Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch
# [Chorus]
# You must be taking to much (E...)
# [Verse]
# Now what bothers me the most
# About hip-hop is we so close
# To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
# We just lost Jam Master J
# Big L got blasted away
# Plus we lost Bugs, Slang Toungue, and Freaky Ta
# It's like a never-ending cycle
# That just seems to come full circle
# Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
# I'm not excluding myself
# Cuz I been stupid as well
# I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
# But as we grow as men
# We learn to let shit go, but then again
# There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
# We all got reps to uphold
# When someone steps on our toes
# It's no exception, it goes for every man
# But if Irv really gave a fuck
# About Ja like he claims he does
# He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
# But he just keeps feeding him pills
# So if that E doesn't kill him
# Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
# Dawg, I'm talking to you straight
# If the situation escalates
# Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
# And if I get killed for this rap
# I got a million in cash
# That says I will get you back in Halie's name
# [Chorus]
# Irvine, get your boy off that (E...)
# [Spoken]
# Get at me, dawg

# Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
# You can't understand how I get my dough
# 50 Cent I'm on fire cause Shady said so
# I'm on fire
# Everybody's in a rush try to get the throne
# I just get on the track and try to set the tone
# I ain't tryna use nobody as a steppin stone
# But don't compare me
# I'm better off jus' left alone
# And I ain't even tryna go there wit record sales
# I'm just tryna keep it humble and respect myself
# Say what up, keep steppin, and just rep D-12
# Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
# And livin wreckless
# But if you go check my belt
# You may see something else I used to protect myself
# A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
# And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
# And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
# Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
# And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
# But this motherfucker Ja musta lost his mind
# That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX
# Then he switched to 'Pac now he's tryna be him next
# So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael
# Juss keep singin' the same song, recycled
# We'd all much rather get along and fight you
# Me and Hailie danced to your songs we liked you
# And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
# C'mon now, you know the white boy'll bite you
# I hurt your pride dawg and you know I don't like to

# Well I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
# Pop the same shit that got Tupac killed
# Spit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode
# and punch a bitch in the nose, til her whole face explodes
# There's three things I hate: girls, women and bitches
# Smack bitches that walk up, and drop-kick midgets
# Call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward
# Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
# Comin through the airport, sluggish, walkin on crutches
# Hit a fuckin [*pregnant chick*] in her [*stomach*] with luggage
# It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, and back out
# Lookin for some other thug, to beat the crap out
# I'm bringin you rap singers two middle fingers
# I flip you off in French, then translate in English

# [in a high falsetto voice]
# Uncle Marshall!
# Will you tell us a bedtime story?
# [regular voice]
# Here we go...
# Now once upon a time not long ago
# There was a little rapper about to blow
# But his album came and it was not good
# I think it went lead or double copper wood
# So the silly little fans they were mislead
# By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
# "Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
# Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
# Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
# The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
# To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
# Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
# And in this corner, we have the mister
# Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
# Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
# this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
# Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
# I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
# You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
# Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!
# [Chorus]
# Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
# Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
# Please tell me what happened with
# That style that you were rappin' with
# Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
# Are you from Los Angeles
# New York or just a janitor
# From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch
# Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
# Picture me for a second and imagine it
# Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
# When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
# It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
# It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
# For me, being just a sick, this conflict
# Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
# And I know how you jealous ones envy
# I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
# The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
# Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
# The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
# None of the messages at Shady Records you left me
# The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!"
# The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
# The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building
# This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me!
# So I went back and read the first few letters that said
# Some shit about a message you left
# Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A"
# This dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!!
# Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre
# We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way)
# [Chorus]
# Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
# Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
# Please tell me what happened with
# That style that you were rappin' with
# Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
# Are you from Los Angeles
# New York or just a janitor
# From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch
# So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib
# The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives
# And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
# Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it
# All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost
# We can fly over the border "Let's go"
# [WOOSH!]
# So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed
# [BOOSH!]
# (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri
# Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste
# Wait, backup hit him one more time in case
# Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car
# Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles
# Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate
# Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate
# And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine'
# "He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way
# "What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous
# That Canibus turned into a television evangelist"
# Plus he raps with his regular voice
# [BOOSH! BOOSH!]
# [BOOSH! BOOSH!]
# (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys
# So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
# His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted
# He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
# I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done
# So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ
# He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife
# He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more
# But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw
# Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up!
# Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch!
# Do somethin'! At least one punchline
# C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
# ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde
# 'Bis c'mon answer me man respond!
# Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars
# Intergalatical metaphors from Mars!
# Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs
# Bite another line from Redman's song!
# Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm
# From a midget reaches out from under the car
# It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither
# Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether
# We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again
# (Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again!
# Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!)
# Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him!
# I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)
# He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again
# [Chorus]
# Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
# Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
# Please tell me what happened with
# That style that you were rappin' with
# Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
# Are you from Los Angeles
# New York or just a janitor
# From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

# (Stanley!) Ok ma'. Santa I'll explain this real simple.
# I'm going to see the rabbi, hes waitin' down at the temple.

# That's gay talk right there, that's H-O-M-O.
# You sendin' this here letter from San Francisco?
# (That's good. San Fran-sisco. That could keep me going right there.)
# But anyways, oh what the hell, ohh yeah.
# Don't be so gay, and about turnin' Jewish,
# Call my lawyer say "Orvet".
# Hang on in one more year, you got a gift comin'.
# Santa Claus gonna' bring you a nice, blonde white woman.
# And if Stan ain't to good, she'll look like Kate Hudson.
# And that Kate Hudson, put her right up on lap,
# And make all kind' sex, on his trouser shorts.(Mmm,Hmm)
# Alright then I gotta go whippin' back on elf.
# Marry Christmas Stan,
# And dont play with yourself. Ho ho ho.

# You can have corn rows inside your hair
# I give a fuck if I don't like your stair
# This bottle of wine goes upside your head
# A little bit psycho, but I know that
# Think we just don't say it, then I won't say it
# See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
# I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
# I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
# You can just keep makin' them tired old threads
# A little bit like the boy you cried wolf, yeah
# See me, but don't dare to try no shit
# Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
# A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
# And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
# Like lightning bolts right out the sky go bad
# From outta nowhere, you might find your career
# Come to it,... and I was like (Oh Yeah)

# They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, cause they talk shit
# Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squase it
# Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit
# And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
# But the pride won't let 'em, inside's a 'Go get 'em'
# And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum?'

# And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
# But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her
# Right in the ass with KY, Yes sir!

# (feat. D12)
# Good mornin
# Haha, wake your mother fuckin asses up
# Yo what is the what?
# Well come on then, you know what time it is
# Stop sleepin on my roof bitch
# For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my arse whipped
# Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets arse squished
# I just can't get past these little pissants
# That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
# And they so mad they can't stand it
# Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk)
# And they can't handle it like a man
# And that's when it just happens
# And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't rap is it?
# Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
# Maybe I'm old fashioned but my pashion
# Is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin
# Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol when I'm pissed now
# But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
# Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it
# Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me
# You poke a stick at a pitbull you get bit B
# These words stick to you like crazy glue
# When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!
# I'm the beatiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
# Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci-dently (argghhh!!)
# I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?
# [Chorus: Eminem]
# Come on an everybody come on an
# Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
# Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an
# Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin
# Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin
# So up an sing along with the words to the song an
# If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
# Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in

# ?? the media pitted me of a beef starter
# In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
# Fuck slugs I'm walkin gloves with a shotgun
# Constantly popin slugs they hot son, better not run
# The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't concious
# In a house full of dog shit,
# I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathin
# You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
# It ain't about what you readin
# When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
# Either that or we'll be beefin free when
# You ******* need a 'E' just to speak shit!
# Your leader is a botique bitch
# Keep the heater where you can reach quick

# In front of every reporter that I don't like
# No need for metaphores I get yours across when I write
# So emotions enough to say "fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!"
# I might as well give this up like heavy sales
# And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt
# We can't self destruct
# I've never felt it this much
# Come on fellas, get up
# We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life

# I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip
# I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith
# Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick
# We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
# You probaly wish that you could be out shootin them G's
# But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
# I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
# But every time we hear you kick it
# The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
# I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
# So when they bust you better bust back
# And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
# And when they want it (yeah)
# I bring a hundred niggas from runave
# So get your gun and if you comin

# I Tell myself that I'm doing alright
# Nothing else to do tonight but
# To go Crazy, Crazy On You
# Lemme go Crazy, Crazy on you
# youuuuuuuuu
# [Verse 1]
# Can't you see what you do to me baby?
# You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac.
# I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
# You truly are the only one who can do this to me
# You just make me get so crazy.
# I go skitzo, I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic
# One minute I want to slit your throat
# The next I want to sex.
# You make me crazy,
# the way we act like 2 maniacs in the sac
# We fuck like 2 jackrabbits
# And maybe that's a bad habit.
# Cuz the next day we're right back at it
# In the same exact pattern
# What the fuck is the matter with us
# We can't figure out if it's
# Lust or it's love
# What's sad is what's attracting us to each other
# They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother.
# Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch
# But I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today
# But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
# Just cuz I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you.
# But if there's one thing about you I admire its, baby,
# Because you stay with me, maybe, because you're as crazy as I am
# Cuz when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
# But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side.
# Like a devil in disguise,
# You're always full of surprises
# Always pullin' devises
# Out your purse, little vibrators and dildos
# You fucked yourself so much
# You barely feel those anymore
# You're only 24 but you're plenty more mature
# Than those other little hoes
# Who just act like little girls
# Like they're in middle school still
# You're crazy sexy cool, chillin
# You play your position
# You never step out of line
# Even though I stay in your business
# You've always kept out of mine.
# I wonder whats on your mind
# Sometimes they say love is blind
# Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
# You ain't see a sign.
# [with Chorus]
# Or maybe you did Maybe you like being shoved
# Maybe cuz we're crazy in loooove
# [Chorus]
# Crazy on you
# Crazy on you
# Let me go crazy crazy on youuuuuuuuu
# [Verse 2]
# You're the ink to my paper
# Where my pen is to my pad
# The moral, the very fiber
# The whole substance to my rap.
# You are my reason for being
# The meaning of my existence
# If it wasn't for you
# I would never be able to spit this
# As intense I do and the irony
# Is you rely on me as much
# as I rely on you to inspire me like you do.
# You provide me the lighter fluid to fuel my fire
# You're my entire supply
# Gas, the match, the igniter.
# The only way that I am able to stay so stable
# Is you're the legs to my table
# If you were to break I'd fall on my face.
# But I'm always going to make you feel
# I don't need you as much as I really need you
# So you don't use it to your advantage.
# But you're essential to me
# You're the air I breathe
# I believe if you ever leave me
# I'd probably have no reason to be.
# You are the Kim to my Marshall
# You're the Slim to my Shady
# The Dre to my Eminem
# The Elaina to my Hailey.
# You are the word I am looking for when
# I'm trying to describe how I feel inside
# And the right one just won't come to my mind.
# You're like the pillar that props me up
# The beam that supports me
# The bitch who never took half,
# The wife who never divorced me.
# You're like the root to my evil
# You let my devil come out me
# You let me beat the shit out you
# Before you beat the shit out me.
# [with Chorus]
# And no matter how much
# Too much is never enough
# Maybe cuz we're crazy in loooove
# [Chorus]
# I'm crazy on you
# Crazy on you
# Let me go crazy crazy on youuuuuuuuu

# I'm leaving today
# Living it, leaving it to change

# Tongue tied and twisted are all my memories
# Celebrating a fantasy come true
# Packing all my bags, finally on the move
# Chorus
# I'm leaving today
# Living it,  oh i'm leaving it to change
# As I'm driving i'm captured by the view
# So much beauty the road becomes my muse
# The heat is rising and my hand surfs through the wind
# Cool calm collected is the child that lies within, see
# Chorus x 2
# But somehow I miss it, I think I'll really miss it
# One day
# I turn up the radio and I'm feeling like I've never felt before
# Turn down the memories of yesteryears and broken dreams I bring
# Finally free
# Slowly drifting
# Into a peaceful breeze
# Chorus x 3
# Living it, leaving it
# Said I'm living it
# I'm leaving it
# Living it, leaving it
# To change
# But somehow I miss it, I think I'll really miss it

# and have pussy lips glued to my face with a clit ring
# in my nose than quit bringin my flows
# Quit givin me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?
# If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
# I wouldn't have to go eenee-meene-mini-moe
# Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more
# Am I the only fuckin one who's normal any more? {Dad!}
# [Chorus]
# [Eminem]
# My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
# at the same time, can make you dry your eyes
# with the same rhyme; see what you're seein is a genius at work
# Which to me isn't work
# So it's easy to misinterpret it at first
# cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek
# I'd yank my fuckin teeth
# Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
# Get struck by fuckin lightnin twice at once
# and die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
# And walk around the rest of my life spit on
# and kicked and hit with shit everytime I sung
# like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump and Grind" comes on
# More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl
# inside of a plane, aimed at the World Trade
# Standin on Ronnie's grave, screamin at the sky
# 'til clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
# And that's pretty much the gist of it
# The parents are pissed but the kids love it
# 9 millimeter heater stashed in 2 seaters with meat cleavers
# I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither
# [Chorus]
# [Hailie]
# Ha ha ha ha!!
# You're funny daddy!

# No bullet, you're so full of shit
# this clip is so full it'll spit if I don't pull it
# And don't give me no bullshit I'm not in the mood

# and one in the chamber, gun in the waist
# and one in the ankle, waitin for someone to come to my place
# tryin to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not

# And it's a disgrace Hailey can't play with her toys
# in the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn
# screamin some shit, leanin out your windows, beepin n shit
# Or pullin up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip
# And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
# so my address ends up on the internet again
# So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin them
# that if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs
# And reporters, blow it out of proportion
# "Oh, now he's pullin guns on his fans
# just for tryin to stand on his porch"
# And I'm the bad guy, cause I don't answer my door like "Hey hi!
# You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!"
# Sometimes I feel like loadin this rifle
# and climbin the roof at night and hidin outside to snipe you
# It's not that I don't like you..
# .. it's just that I'm not behind the mic
# I'm a person who's just like you

# From these bitches on our dicks
# Fucking chickens with no ribs
# That's why I aint got no time
# [Obie Trice]
# Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk
# I hadda bag of tha skunk, one and last night's tunk
# Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise, from the Cleaners
# Fucked me good, you should've seen us
# Big booty bitch, switch unbearable, french role styling,
# body like a stallion
# Sizing up the figure, while my shit getting bigger
# Debating on to fuck her, do I wanna be a nigga?
# Caressing this bitch, plus I'm checking out them tits
# Sipping on that fine shit, I ain't use to buying
# I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
# Like taking ho's money, but that's another story
# For surely your pussy on toast, after we toast
# Her clothes fell like Bishop and Juice
# The womb beater, clean pussy eater, inserting my john
# In that spot hotter than the hottest block, don't stop!
# Response I got when I was knocking it
# Clocks steading ticking, kinky finger licking
# The cannon, semen's at my tip when she moans
# I gotta slow down before I cum soon
# And work that nigga, like a slave owner
# When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
# She foaming at the lips, the ones between her hips
# Pubic hair's looking like some sour cream dip
# Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
# Pussy tighter than conditions of his black folks
# Me in the final stretch, the last part of sex
# I bust a fat ass nut - then I woke up next
# Like, what the fuck is going on here?
# This bitch evapourated, pussy and all just picked up and vaccated
# And now I'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected
# And doctor Wesley telling me I ain't really got that shit

# And she's pregnant, but she's egging me on, begging me to throw her
# Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force
# And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
# What's she shoving me for? Doesn't she love me no more?
# Wasn't she hugging me four minutes ago at the door?
# Man I'm this close to going toe to toe with this whore
# What would you do if she was telling you she wants a divorce
# She's having another baby in a month and it's yours
# And you found it isn't cause this bitch has been visiting
# Someone else and sucking his dick and kissing you on the lips
# When you get back to Michigan, Now the plot has thickend 'n worse
# Cause you feel like you've been sticking your fucking dick in a hurse
# So your paranoid at every little cold that you get
# Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holding your dick
# So you goto the clinic, sweating every minute your in it
# Then the doctor comes out looking like Dennis the Menace *hahahaha*
# And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's aids
# He ain't even gotta to call in you the office to say it
# So you jet back home, cause you gon' get that ho
# And when you see her, you're gon' bend her fucking neck back yo
# Cause you love her, you never would've expect that blow
# Obie told you to scoop, how could she stoop that low?

# Prelude:
# Obie...Yo...I'm sick...
# Damn...you straight dog?
# Chorus:
# That's why I ain't got no time
# For these games and stupid tricks
# Or these bitches on my dick
# That's how dudes be getting sick
# That's how dicks' be getting drips
# Falling victims to this shit
# From these bitches on our dicks
# Fucking chickens with no ribs
# That's why I aint got no time...
# Obie Trice:
# Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk
# I had a bag of the skunk won in last nights Tunk
# Pussy residue was on my penis,
# Denise from the cleaners
# Fucked me good,
# you should've seen this big booty bitch,
# switch unbearable, french role styling,
# body like a stallion
# Sizing up the figure, while my shit getting bigger
# Debating on a fuck or do I wanna be a nigga
# Caressing this bitch, plus I'm checking out them tits
# Sippin' on that fine shit, I ain't use to buying
# I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
# Like taking ho's money, but that's another story
# For surely the pussy on toast, after we toast
# Our clothes fell like Bishop in Juice
# The womb beater, clean pussy eater, inserting my jock
# In that spot hotter than the hottest block, don't stop!
# The response I got when I was knocking it
# Clock steading ticking, kinky finger lickin'
# The can on, semen's at my tip when she moans
# I gotta slow down before I cum soon
# And work that nigga, like a slave owner
# When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
# She foaming at the lips, the ones between them hips
# Pubic hair's looking like some sour cream dip
# Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
# Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
# We in the final stretch, the last part of sex
# I bust a fat ass nut - then I woke up next
# Like, what the fuck is going on here?
# This bitch evaporated, pussy and all,
# just picked up and vacated
# Now I'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected
# And doctor Wesley telling me I really got that shit
# Fuck
# Chorus:
# Eminem:
# Now I don't wanna hit no woman but this chicks got it coming
# Someone better get this bitch before she gets kicked in the stomach
# And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw her
# Off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force
# And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
# But what's she shoving me for? Doesn't she love me no more?
# Wasn't she hugging me four minutes ago at the door?
# Man I'm this close to going toe to toe with this whore
# What would you do if she was telling you she wants a divorce
# She's having another baby in a month and it's yours
# And you found it isn't cause this bitch has been visiting
# Someone else and sucking his dick and kissing you on the lips
# When you get back to Michigan, Now the plot has thickenin' worse
# Cause you feel like you've been sticking your fucking dick in a hearse
# So you paranoid at every little cold that you get
# Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holding your dick
# So you goto the clinic, sweating every minute your in it
# Then the doctor comes out looking like Dennis the Menace
# And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's AIDS
# He ain't even gotta to call in you his office to say it
# So you jet back home, cause you gone get that ho
# And when you see her, you're gonna bend her fucking neck back yo
# Cause you love her, you never would expect that blow
# Obie told you to scoop, how could she stoop that low?
# Jesus, I don't believe this, bitch works at the Cleaner's
# Bringin' me home diseases swingin' from Obie's penis
# She's so deceivin', shit this ho's a genius
# She g'd us

# girl:  yeah... whoooo...shit
# hmmm, whoaaa, hmm ...
# Guess what?
# I ain't coming in yet, i'll come in in a minute
# Aiyo, this is my love song. It goes like this....
# Back when Mark Wallburg was marky mark
# This is how we used to make the party start
# We used to...mix hen with bacardi dark
# and when it... kicks in you can hardly talk
# and by the... sixth gin you gon probly crawl
# and you'll be... sick then and you'll probly barf
# and my pre-...diction is that you gon probably fall
# either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
# and every-... things spinnin your beginning to
# think women are swimmin in
# pink linen again in the sink
# then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
# you are now allowed to officially slap bitches
# you have the right to remain violent and start wildin
# start a fight with the same guy that was smart eye'n ya
# get in the car and start it and start drivin
# over the island and cause a 42 car pile up
# Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot, looking for life on this
# planet sir, no sign of it
# All i could see is a bunch of smoke flyin and
# I'm so high that I might die if i go by it.
# Let me out of this place I'm outta place,
# I'm in in outter space, I've just
# vanished without a trace.
# I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow,
# I'll be back in an hour or so.
# Cuz every time I go to try to leave (whoa-o-o)
# someone keeps pullin on my sleeve (whoa-o-o)
# I dont wanna but I gotta stay (whoa-o-o)
# these drugs really gotta hold on me (whoa-o-o)
# Cuz everytime I try ta tell 'em no (no-o-o)
# they won't let me ever let 'em go (go-o-o)
# I'm a sucker all I gotta say (whoa-o-o)
# these drug's really gotta hold on me (whoa-o-o)
# In third grade all I used to do, was sniff glue through a
# tube and play rubixcube
# Seventeen years later I'm as rude as jude
# Schemein on the first chick with the hugest boobs
# I got no game, and every face looks the same
# they got no name, so i don't need game to play
# I just say whatever I want, to whoever I want,
# whenever i want, wherever I want, however I want
# However I do show some respect to few
# This ecstacy has got me standin next to you
# Gettin sentimental as fuck, spillin guts to you
# We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
# But your on it too, so you tell me you love me too,
# Wake up in the morning like "What the fuck we do?"
# I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do, Cuz if
# I get caught cheatin then I'm stuck with you
# But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna
# catch up sooner or later
# But fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy,
# let the ex destroy your spinal chord,
# so it's not a straight line no more
# So we walk around lookin like some wind-up dolls,
# Shit stickin out of ourbacks like a dinosaur,
# Shit, six hit's won't even get me high no more,
# so bye for now, I'm gonna try
# to find some more
# Chorus
# That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
# when you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
# And tomorrow your probably gonna wanna do it again
# What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it
# and whats a little bit of alcohol poisoning? and whats a little fight,
# tomorrow you'll be boys again
# It's your life, live it however you wanna
# Marajuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
# It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin
# Cuz none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin
# They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin,
# even though you wake upfeelin like shit every mornin.
# But you're young, you got a lot of drugs to do,
# girls to screw, parties tocrash, sucks to be you
# If I could take it all back now I wouldn't,
# I woulda did more shit thatpeople said that I shouldnt
# But I'm all grown up now,
# and upgraded and graduated to better drugs and
# updated
# But I still gotta a lot of growin up to do,
# I still gotta whole lot ofthrowin up to spew
# But when it's all said and done
# i'll be forty before i know it wit a 40 on
# the porch tellin stories
# with a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap,
# babysitting for Hailie, while
# Hailie's out gettin smashed.
# Chorus x 2

# ("It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway.)
# Sometimes I just feel like
# Quittin I still might
# Why do I put up this fight?
# Why do I still write?
# Sometimes it's hard enough steal from the real life
# Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
# And show these people what my level of skill's like
# But I'm still white
# Sometimes I just hate life
# Somethin ain't right
# Hit the breaklights
# In case of the stage fright
# Draw on the blank light
# (Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
# And I clam up (SMASH!)
# I just slam shut
# I just can't do it
# My whole manhood's just been stripped
# I've just been ripped
# So I must been dipped
# Or the bustin split
# Man fuck this shit yo
# I'm goin the fuck home
# Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.
# (Chorus)
# I'm a man
# I'm a make a new plan
# Time for me to stand up and travel new land
# Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
# Once I'm over these tracks man
# I'm a never look back
# (8 Mile Rd.)
# And I'm gone
# I don't like where I'm goin
# Sorry mama I've grown
# I must travel alone
# Ain't no followin no footsteps
# I'm makin my own
# Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.
# Walkin these traintracks
# Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
# 'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
# To the same plant
# And the same pants
# Tryin to chase rap
# Gotta move A.S.A.P.
# Get a new plan
# Mama's got a new man
# Poor little baby sister
# She don't understand
# Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
# And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
# While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
# Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
# Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
# But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
# Sometimes I get upset
# Cuz I ain't blew up yet
# It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
# Don't gotta rap my step
# Don't got enough pep
# The pressure's too much man
# I'm just tryin to do what's best
# And I try
# Sit alone and I cry
# Yo I won't tell a lie
# Not a moment goes by
# That I don't pray to the sky
# Please I'm beggin you God
# Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
# Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
# Wherever you are
# Yo I'm tellin you dog
# I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
# Tell my mother I love her
# Kiss baby sister goodbye
# Say whenever you need me baby
# I'm never too far
# But yo, I gotta get out there
# The only way I know
# And I'm going to be back for you
# On the second that I blow
# On everything I own
# I'll make it on my own
# Off to work I go
# Back to this 8 Mile Rd.
# (Chorus)
# Ya gotta live it to feel it
# If you didn't you wouldn't get it
# We'll see what the big deal is
# Why it wasn't, it still is
# To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
# It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
# You'd never even see
# But it's everything to me
# It's my credibility
# You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
# Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
# But check
# Still unsigned
# Havin a rough time
# Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
# Go to work
# And servin MC's in the lunch line
# But when it come's crunch time
# Where do my punch lines go?
# Who must I show?
# To bust my flow?
# Where must I go?
# Who must I know?
# Or am I just another crab in the bucket
# Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
# Maybe I need a new outlit
# I'm startin to doubt shit
# I'm feelin a little scepticle
# Of who I hang out with
# I look like a bum
# Yo my clothes ain't about shit
# At the Salvation Army
# Tryin to salvage and outfit
# And it's cold
# Tryin to travel this road
# Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
# My defenses are so up
# And one thing I don't want
# Is pity from no one
# The city is no fun
# There is no sun
# And it's so dark
# Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
# Being torn in my limbs
# By each one of my friends
# Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
# Sometimes I feel like a robot
# Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
# I just blow
# My head is a stove top
# I just explode
# The kettle gets so hot
# Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
# But I've learned
# It's time for me to U-Turn
# Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
# Ain't no fallin
# No next time
# I meet a new girl
# I can no longer play stupid
# Or be immature
# I've got every ingredient
# All I need is the courage
# Like I already got to beat
# All I need is the words
# Got the urge
# Suddenly its a search
# Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
# Time to show these free world leaders
# Three in the third
# I am no longer scared now
# I'm free as a bird
# And I turn and cross over
# The median curb
# Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.

# Paul, 'the way you make me feel' with these calls
# You should really take a look at the 'man in the mirror'

# Do you 'remember the time' we were watching the 'Billy Jean' video?
# Well he'll always be that Michael to me

# Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap

# Who may have never got to see our faces
# Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
# Broke down barriers of language and races
# Just call on the cape crusaders
# And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
# And we can play the back and forth all day
# Like the hot potato game, thats why we came to
# [Chorus]

# 50 cent, come on!

# Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
# We make the club jump everywhere we go

# And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
# Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
# All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
# [Eminem]
# Hands up for the grand finale
# Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
# Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
# [Dr. Dre]
# You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
# Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
# [Eminem]
# So nervous, ain't never cuz Shady Aftermath together

# No one could do it better
# We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh

# And don't worry about that Detox album
# It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, haha

# Lord please forgive me for what I do
# For I know not what I've done
# [Chorus]
# Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
# I just never had the chance to ever meet you
# Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
# My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
# Momma had a baby and it's head popped off
# (head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)
# My momma don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
# (gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)
# Ring ring ring, on the door bell of the next door neighbors on their front porch
# (their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
# But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone elses lawn
# (elses lawn, elses lawn, elses lawn)
# Till somebody finally took me in, my great aunt, uncle Edna 'n Charles
# (Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)
# They were the ones who were left in charge
# My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song
# (sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)
# It went a little something like mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
# Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
# Momma why do they keep saying this I just dont understand, understand
# And by the way, where's my dad?
# [Chorus]
# Predominantly, predominantly, everythings always predominantly
# Predominantly white, predominantly black
# Well, what about me, where does that leave me
# Well I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em
# I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
# While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
# Do you think that I'm kidding?
# What do I look like some kind of idi-wait a minute, shit, don't answer that
# Why am I so misunderstood?
# Why do I go through so much bullshit, it sucks bullshit, it's tush mull bish
# Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again
# Whining about his millions and his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
# And the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
# And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
# Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
# I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
# Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
# Man if I only had half of it.
# If you only knew the half of it
# [Chorus]
# Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
# Please release me from these deamons
# I never had any of this shit planned ma, please believe
# I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
# Now look at all the pain I caused
# Dear Santa Clause, why you not comin' this year again
# What did I do that was so bad to deserve this
# Everything could have been so perfect
# But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air
# Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
# I don't even know what it feel like, they know me cuz I'm in this ferris wheel
# And all i wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel
# Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
# Here we go now, doe see doe now, curtains up, the show must go now
# Ring around the rosie, the shows over, you can all go home now
# But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
# Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
# So please god, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
# Till I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone
# [Chorus x2]

# Look, if you had, one shot; one opportunity
# To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
# Would you capture it, or just let it slip, yo;
# His palms are sweaty, knees weak arms are heavy
# There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
# He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
# To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down
# The whole crowd grows so loud he opens his mouth
# But the words won't come out
# He's chokin' how, everybody's chokin' now
# The clocks run out, times up, over, bloah!
# Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh,
# There goes rabbit he choked, he's so mad but he won't,
# Give up that easy, no, he won't have it he knows,
# His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope,
# He knows that but he's broke, he so stacked that he knows,
# When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
# Back to the lab again, yo
# This whole rap city better go capture this moment
# And hope it don't pass him
# You better lose yourself in the music,
# The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
# You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo
# You better lose yourself in the music,
# The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
# You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo
# His souls escaping, through this hole that is gaping
# This world is mine for the taking, make me king
# As we move toward'a, new world ord'a, a normal life is boring
# But superstardoms, close to post mortum
# It only grows harder, only grows hotter
# He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
# Coast to coast shows he's known as the globetrotter
# Lonely roads god only knows, he's grown farther from home
# He's no father, he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
# But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
# These hoes don't want him no mo' he's cold product
# They moved on to the next shmo' who flows he nose dove, and sold nada
# So the soap opera's told it unfolds I suppose it's old partner
# But the beat goes on da da dum da da dum datta
# You better lose yourself in the music,
# The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
# You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo
# You better lose yourself in the music,
# The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
# You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo
# No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
# Tear this mother fuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged
# I was playin in the beginning, the mood all changed
# I been chewed up, and spit out and booed off stage
# But I kept rhymin' and step writin' the next cypher
# You best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
# All the pain inside amplified by the, fact that
# I can't get by with my nine to five
# And I can't provide the right type'a
# Life for my family 'cause man,
# These goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
# And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer,
# This is my life and these times are so hard
# And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
# Teetertotter caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
# Baby mama drama's screamin' on and
# Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot, another jam or not
# Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
# To formulate a plot 'fore I end up in jail or shot
# Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
# Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
# I cannot grow old in Salem's lot,
# So here I go it's my shot, feet fail me not
# This maybe the only opportunity that I got
# You better lose yourself in the music,
# The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
# You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo
# You better lose yourself in the music,
# The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
# You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo
# You can do anything you set your mind to man.

# [Chorus: Eminem]
# This kinda music
# Use it and you get in to do shit
# Whenever you hear some shit
# And you can't refuse this
# Just some shit
# For these kids to trash their rooms with
# Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
# The type of shit
# That you don't have to ask who produced it
# You just know
# That's the new shit
# The type of shit that causes mass confusion
# And drastic movement of people acting stupid
# [Kon Artis]
# I come to every club with intention to do harm
# With a prosthetic arm
# And smelling like ?? farm (?)
# Hiding under tables as soon as I hear alarms
# Paranoia ?? to steal from his own mom
# Kuniving Kon
# Artis with a bomb
# Strapped to my stomach screaming
# "Let's get it on"
# A lust that love the drank
# Drunk driving a tank
# Rolling over a bank
# Cops see my and faint
# It's drastic
# And I'm passed my limit of coke
# I think I'll up my high by slitting your throat
# Push a baby carriage into the street
# Till it's minced meat
# Your mens been beat
# The minute I step foot on your street
# This is fight music!
# You know why my hands are so numb? (No)
# Cuz my grandmother sucked my dick
# And I didn't cum (Oh)
# Smacked this whore for talking crap (Bitch)
# So what if she's handicapped (What?)
# The bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap

# Fucking Crazy
# Hi!
# Oringinal bad boy on the case cover your face
# Came in the place blowed and sprayed Puffy with mace
# I laced your weed with insect repellent better check the smellin'
# Eminem starts with an E, better check the spellin' with a capital
# Sombody grab me a snapple
# I got an asthma capsule trapped in my adam's apple
# Sombody dropped me on my head and I'm sure that my mother did it
# But the bitch won't admit it was her
# I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
# And said I'm ready now bitch, ain't you feelin' these kicks cunt?
# The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
# I'll probably have to settle next to the furnace in hell
# I'm sick of the sperm cells with syphalis germs
# And I'm hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns
# I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
# And vomit so much blod that your clothes stick to you from it
# Hit you in the head with a brick till you plummet
# If ya'll don't like me you can suck my dick till you numb it
# And all that gibberish that you were spittin' you need to kill it
# And your style is like dying in my sleep, I don't feel it
# (Chorus)
# Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
# For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
# Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
# Is fuckin' crazy (Hello? Hi)
# Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
# For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
# Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
# Is fuckin' crazy (Hello? Hi)
# My mic's grillin' you, staring you down with a grin to grin
# I'm Eminem, you're a fag at a women's gym
# I'm Slim, so Shady is really you're fake alias
# To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
# A braniac with a cranium packed full of more uranium than a maniac Saudi Arabian
# A highly cumbustible head, spasmatic strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
# Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
# I flat lined, jumped up and ran for the mortician
# High speed, IV full of Thai weed, lookin' Chinese
# With my knees stuck together like siamese
# Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
# Pins and needles hyperdermic needles and pins
# I hope God forgives me for my sins
# It probably all depends on if I keep on killin' my girlfriends
# (Chorus)
# Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
# For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
# Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
# Is fuckin' crazy (Hello? Hi)
# Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
# For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
# Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
# Is fuckin' crazy (Hello? Hi)
# Last night I OD'd on rush, mushrooms and dust
# And got rushed to the hospoital to get my system flushed (shucks)
# I'm an alcoholic, and that's all I can say
# I call in to work cause all I do is frolick and play
# I swallow grenades, take a bottle of water a day
# A Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be
# Gimme eleven Excedrin and my head'll spin
# Medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine
# Scratch my balls till I shred the skin
# Doctor check this rash, look how red it's been
# It's probably Aids, forget it then
# I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
# That don't even make sense, like dikes using dildos
# So reach in your billfold for ten duckets
# And pick up your Slim Shady shit is on rucus
# Somethin' somethin' somethin', I get weeded
# My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
# (Chorus)
# Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
# For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
# Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
# Is fuckin' crazy (Hello? Hi)
# Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
# For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
# Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
# Is fuckin' crazy (Hello? Hi)
# Hi! Something's not right, I'm sorry, I'm mentally retarded
# Slim shady, I think that's my name
# Rucus Records, fuckin' crazy
# You hear us?  We're fuckin' crazy!
# All of us

# "Hey let me get your number; I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!"
# Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed?

# Hey yo dawg... I got some shit on my motha fuckin' chest... that
# I need  to get I need to get off cause, if I don't...
# I'm gonna fuckin explode, or somethin'
# Now look - this is a story about...
# some little fuckin' girls that I know
# It goes like this...
# It's so easy for me to make enemies any more it's sickening
# People are lookin' for an excuse to jump on my shitlist
# Stickin their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
# I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
# Now I'm in the position that, I don't wanna be in shit
# I never had no beef with your corny son of a bitches
# But now the shit is broke and you can't do nothin to fix it
# So I'm tellin you right now - motherFUCK a Limp Bizkit
# Now I'm gonna be real, B-Real was real
# He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin';
# see he chilled
# He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
# I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils
# Peoples, whatever your backpackin cypherin name is
# Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you sayin and
# I'da never involved you, but you had to add your two pennies
# Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies
# Hit the studio and I'll admit, I had a few in me
# Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
# But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked
# I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
# Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentionin me
# That little fuckin weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV
# After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV
# Talkin bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?
# Come on dawg, you was supposed to be on that song
# Talkin bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong?
# What's wrong? You scared, and Fred, you said you was dissin him too
# I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
# You fuckin sissy, up on stage, screamin how people hate you
# They don't hate you
# They just think you're corny since Christina played you
# And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
# That's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin my ass
# Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song I'm tryin to pre-warn you
# Lethal when I fuckin see you dawg I'm swingin on you!
# Motherfuckers must think cause I'm in trouble with the law
# that I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow
# [Chorus]
# Y'all some - girrrrls - y'all are some god damn girls
# Why do you act this way? - Why do you act this way huh?
# Why do y'all act like fuckin sissies you pussies
# keep talkin shit behind my back you just some bitches for that
# And we all knowwww - we all know, hah
# How fuckin cowards rollll - "keep rollin rollin rollin"
# In fuckin Bentley's and pretend to be down
# But as soon as someone calls you out
# You put your tail between your legs and bow dowwwn
# [Eminem]
# Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs
# I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
# So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
# is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
# and I won't put you in 'em
# Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs
# I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
# So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
# is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
# and I won't put you in 'em
# Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on
# But if I help you sell one record
# and I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked
# See I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends
# Now I got five dawgs that'll die for me like I'll die for them
# I'll fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim
# All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
# That goes for all of my dogs, from Royce to Dre
# From Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away
# in my coffin I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested
# I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested
# Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated
# I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
# This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil
# But I will never be this gullible ever again though (nope)
# Next time I'll know when someone's copyin off me
# I'm not bein cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin me
# I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger (hey!)
# I say "Fuck Christina" he says "Fuck Christina" but meaner
# So from doin a song with Method to beggin to get accepted
# I'm peggin Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
# And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said
# I'm fuckin you up punk, you're dead! Don't think that I'm playin
# And fuck BIZKIT! Cause I know you're sayin fuck D-12
# Only not to our face, under your breath, to yourselves
# [Chorus]
# You little - girrrrls - motherfuckin females
# Why do you act this way? - Why do y'all act this way huh?
# Why do y'all act like fuckin sissies you pussies
# keep talkin shit behind my back you just some bitches for that
# And we all knowwww - now we all know the truth
# How fuckin cowards rollll - "keep rollin rollin rollin"
# In-fuckin-dent me's and pretend to be down
# But as soon as someone calls you out
# You put your tail between your legs and bow dowwwn

# And that's it, that's all there is to it dawg
# If you didn't wanna do the fuckin song
# don't say you're down with doin the fuckin song
# and then back out at the last minute
# And then go on motherfuckin MTV talkin about
# Everlast can whip my motherfuckin ass
# If you're scared of Whitey Ford dog
# just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it
# That's all you had to fuckin say, I wouldn'ta said shit
# I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin song myself
# and not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all
# Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more
# I'm on some fuckin-you-up shit when I see you

# Actin' like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy
# Sweat drip get me off this trip, someone stop this train
# Some say my brain is all corrupted fuckin' with this shit
# I'm suck, I'm addicted to these drugs, I'ma quit
# sayin' motherfuckas names before somebody fucks me up
# Ain't no pussies over here partner, see you in hell, fucka
# [Chorus: Eminem]
# Come get me
# Motherfucka, if you want Shady
# If Pac was still here now
# He would never ride with Ja
# Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
# Get off that E
# 'Fore you try to come and fuck with me
# It's Aftermath here down, Shady Records got it locked
# La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la locked
# [Verse 2: 50 Cent]
# Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
# Never realize the precious time that bitch niggaz is wastin'
# Institutionalize my bitchez bring me product by the bundle
# Hustle hard for da cell, G-Unit motherfucka, we ballin'
# Catch me countin' cheese and when I'm callin', do you accept my calls?
# Still let me sip on Hennessy, can I sip some more?
# Hell, I done been to jail, I ain't scared
# Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
# I got a head with no screws in it
# Motherfuckas thinkin' they can stop 50, they losin' it
# Lil' nigga named Ja think he live like me
# Talkin' about he left the hospital took nine like me
# You livin' fantasies nigga, I been checkin' deposit
# When your lil' sweet ass gon' come out of the closet?
# Now he wonderin' why DMX blowed him out
# Next time grown folks talkin', bitch, close yo mouth
# Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
# Done seen too many real niggaz ball to let these bitch niggaz beat me
# Black , you's a motherfuckin' punk and you'll see me with gloves
# Quit scarin' them fuckin' kids with yo ugly ass mom
# And you can tell them niggaz you roll with whatever you want
# But you and I know what's goin' on
# Nigga payback, Tah, I know yo bitch ass from way back
# Witness me strap the mac, knew I don't play that
# All these old rappers tryina advance
# It's all over now, take it like a man [haha!]
# Irv lookin' like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
# Tryina playa hate on my shit
# Man, eat a fat dick!
# Lovin' this shit, that's how you made me
# Feelin' like I got you niggaz crazy
# Uh huh, against all odds
# ONly  my thug motherfuckas know
# This be the realest shit I ever wrote
# Against all odds
# Up in the studio gettin' blowed
# To the truest shit I ever spoke
# 21 gun salute, bitch!
# [Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
# Ay yo, I been one of the most humble
# Reppin' streets to the core
# Ay Jeffrey, what the fuck you come and bother me for?
# It's been a long time comin', like a blessing to check you
# See, 106 & Park fans don't even fuckin' respect you
# It's kinda funny, wanna be Pac, wanna fake like he thug
# Runnin' around talkin' shit that he ain't capable of
# Now let me off this cock sucka, watch me handle you nigga
# If I recall, Violator used to manage you nigga
# They took a closer look and realized you wasn't impostured
# There's never been a Violator on the Murder Inc. roster, dumbass
# Now, who shootin'? Awww, made you look!
# You said Bust' singin' the same old hook? You stupid!
# If y'all shootin', I take a look at yo man
# The bitch shot himself in front of Def Jam
# Chedda bob ass niggaz, start adjustin' yo plan
# You let the streets down nigga, apologize to yo fans
# Watched you pull a lil' stunt like we ain't know what it was
# Lil' faggot, desperate tryina reestablish a buzz
# I know the shit is drivin' you crazy, you wonderin' how
# The streets ain't never want you, Beatrice, whachu gonna do now?
# Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefin' with you
# I think about the game and what it's like and
# "What would it be without you?"
# You finished, I ain't tryina repeat this
# Just 'cause I'm cool, you shouldn't take my kindness for weakness
# [Busta Rhymes talking]
# Oh shit... it was fun...
# Next time you got a problem man...
# Address me before you try to make the shit a public issue homey...
# Now I'ma return back to my regular self...
# And have fun again... one!

# [Intro - Spoken]
# Yo, I can't sing it
# I feel like singin
# I wanna fuckin'sing
# Cuz I'm happy
# Yeah, I'm happy
# Ha Ha
# I got my baby back
# Yo, check it out
# [Verse 1 - Sung]
# Some days I sit, starin'out the window
# Watchin'this world pass me by
# Sometimes I think theres nothin'to live for
# I almost break down and cry
# Somtimes I think I'm crazy
# I'm crazy, oh so crazy
# Why am I here, am I just wasting my time?
# But then I see my baby
# Suddenly I'm not crazy
# It all makes sense when I look into her eyes
# [Chorus]
# Somtimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
# Everyone's leanin'on me
# Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
# But then she comes back to me
# [Verse 2 - Sung]
# My baby girl [Hailie laughs] keeps gettin'older
# I watch her grow up with pride
# People make jokes, cuz they don't understand me
# They just dont see my real side
# I act like shit don't phase me,
# Inside it drives me crazy
# My insecurities could eat me alive
# But then I see my baby
# Suddenly I'm not crazy
# It all makes sense when I look into her eyes
# [Chorus]
# [Verse 3 - Rapped]
# Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singing this song to my daughter
# If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
# To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
# God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mum didn't want her
# Now you probly get this picture from my public persona
# That I'm a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his momma,
# But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
# Cuz there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul,
# And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
# This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
# And this load is like the weight of the world
# And I think my neck is breaking should I just give up,
# Or try to live up to these expectations?
# Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself,
# But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin'hell
# But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
# So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
# But the years that I've wasted are nothing to the tears that I've tasted
# So here's what im facin:
# 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
# I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
# I've taken bats to peoples backs, bent over backwards for this woman
# Man, I shoulda seen it comin, why'd I stick my penis up in?
# Woulda ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin
# But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
# I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie
# So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
# My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
# And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
# It's like the greatest gift you can get
# The weight has been lifted
# Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
# Everyone's leanin'on me
# Cuz my baby know's that her daddy's a soldier
# Nothin' can take her from me
# [Outro - Spoken]
# Woo!
# I told you I can't sing.
# Oh well, I tried
# Hailie, 'member when I said
# If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
# Well guess what?
# Daddy's here.
# And I ain't goin'nowhere baby
# I love you! (kiss)

# Verse 1 -[ Obie Trice]
# Baby im feeling the feelings you givin', Im feelin your style
# N' im willing to let my guard down to figure u out
# Im picturin your figure in a swimsuit whilin
# Somewhere in the carribean islands
# Cuz the vibe you giving me now
# Feels like im a innocent child
# A sinner whose never tempted when other womens around
# Hands down this is my vow
# I never heard a moan sound so profound
# wen a niggas diggin u out

# quit calling the house

# im on edge u put the palm of ur hand on my head and squeeze
# please believe i aint scared of commitment
# fuck head from them bitches
# wen u could do the same

# our intimacy is significantly different
# [Chorus - Eminem]
# you gon' ride for me

# Can we re- can we re-enact Biggie's song?
# C-can you shit on me?
# I just want you to shit on me
# [Hook - Eminem (singing)]
# Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
# I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend
# If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
# I'll kill you
# Bitch I'm fuckin'
# For real I'll make you suffer like I suffered
# If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love
# [in the background of the hook]
# Hey lady, hey lady
# I don't think you really wanna be my girl
# (be my girl, be my girl, be my girl)
# Fuckin' with me can be dangerous (dangerous, dangerous)
# You never know what I really (be like, be like)
# (be like, be like, I'm your type)
# (And might even get a little bit crazy)
# [Obie Trice]
# Baby I'm extra large (huge) in magnitude
# And Magnums to lubrication that I use
# To chose which hole on a ho I abuse (yes)
# Have 'em confused, can't tell who is who
# When I fuck the shit out you, then the next date (bitch)
# I rush the shit out you off my two-way (ooh wait)
# You wanna cuddle, emotional hustle up on Pocono's
# Poke ya nose in and outta Obie's own
# No, I'm in and out your home
# And this in and out your tone
# I ain't the nigga that settles 'em down
# Put 'em in nice homes and floss 'em around (nah)
# I bounce 'em around
# Camcord the sex and sell 'em around town
# How that sound?
# If I was in love witcha, now you wanna clown
# Fuck with them clowns until I pound on your crown
# Bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me
# Bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury
# You don't want it with me, you just horny as me
# You want a nut, nuttin' but what is you be
# [Eminem]
# I'm internationally known baby but actually
# There are few people who know how I am naturally
# All you know is that I can act irrationally
# When you shove a puppet up in my face on national TV
# So they label me this crazed loony rap bully
# But truthfully that ain't the truth
# And if you believe in that shit
# Then you'll believe anything's true
# And you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally
# But personally that actually works for me
# Cuz the last thing that I need's a string attached to me
# I'ma bachelor bitch and I ain't in no fast fury
# To run out and find a new Mrs. Mathers
# Cuz see, technically me and Kim ain't back fully
# But we do still make booty calls occasionally
# But be damned if I end up back in that pad
# And we end up back at that god damn tavern
# And havin' another déjŕ vu, we seein' security
# Pass my pussy around like it's Ja Rule's jewelry
# I got news for you bitch, your news curfew's early
# You ain't home by 2:30 [gunshot]

# Despite the fact you think you the feisty type
# O love to fight (uh) I love the drama (yeah)
# Love when my bitch get to cussin' out Yolanda (fuck you bitch)
# Find the Obie condom on the counter
# Swingin' her weave, can't breathe like I can't believe
# Least I ain't deceieve and try to mislead
# And sell a dream just to get you on my team
# I came clean to keep down the beef
# Keep down my reach, you can keep all your teeth
# [Eminem]
# What we do under the covers should stay between the covers
# And the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage
# On the front page cover of "Buzz's New Lovers"
# And this is when the bitch get to showin' the true colors
# Cuz the truth of it, everything that I do's public
# And you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends
# Guess who you just screwed, assume just me and you've done it
# And say that you was rubbered and show 'em the proof of it
# But I guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you
# But you better be careful of who you're doin' it to
# Cuz you never know when the shoe
# Could end up on the other foot and it backfires on you
# Cuz you think you want it then you want me, then you get me
# Then you got me and you're fucked cuz you'll be stuck with me
# For the rest of your life cuz if I get attached to you
# We'll be joined at the hip, I'll be so latched to you
# You'll be walkin' out the house and I'll run up and tackle you
# Chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you
# You don't think you're leavin' this house in that, do you?
# Not till I brand my name in your ass and tattoo you
# And have you walkin' out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters
# Scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather
# Front on me? Never
# Cuz we gonna be together forever
# Right bitch? [gun cock]
# Right bitch? [gun cock, shot]

# [Intro]
# So i chose, huh
# You got a phone,
# Pick it up and call me
# [Chorus:]
# How come, we don't even talk no mo',
# And you don't even call no mo',
# We don't barely keep in touch at all,
# And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo',
# And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,
# After all the years we've been down,
# Ain't no way, no how,
# This bullshit can't be true,
# We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's you
# [Verse One]
# We were so young,
# So full of life and vivrance,
# Side by side wherever you was ridin', I went,
# So close or most us some Bonnie and Clyde shit,
# When Ronnie died you was right by my side,
# With a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes,
# And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it,
# You even had the same type of childhood I did,
# Sometimes I just wanna know why,
# Is it that you sur-came to yours,
# And mine I survived it,
# You ran the streets I nine to fived it,
# We grew up, grew apart this time went by us,
# Then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises,
# Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it,
# Much as your pride tries to hide it,
# You're cold your touch is just like ice,
# And your eyes is the look of resentment,
# I can sense it and I don't like it
# [Chorus:]
# How come, we don't even talk no mo',
# And you don't even call no mo',
# We don't barely keep in touch at all,
# And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo',
# And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,
# After all the years we've been down,
# Ain't no way, no how,
# This bullshit can't be true,
# We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's you
# (Kon Artis)
# [Verse Two]
# It was my dream at first to be all spittin the verse,
# On my own album with a deal but shit got worse,
# So I came out I would'a killed a nigga first,
# 'Fore I let him disrespect me,
# Or check me up with somethin' worse,
# Some bitch that I wasn't with,
# I would'a hit her to would'a quit,
# But you were plain talkin' to her,
# And tell her she was the shit,
# I told you don't get involved with her,
# You were smoking the cron'c with her,
# Coming out'a the bar with her,
# Stumblin' hands drunk,
# Like Devil's husband or wife or somthin',
# But me catchin' he fuckin' other nigga,
# Must've hurt your pride or somthin',
# 'Cause you wolf I fit them after people,
# Like you want it with me,
# When all I tried to do is show you that your bitch was shifty,
# And lyrics is the fans and all the shit that I produce,
# You actin' like I ain't your man,
# And lyin' like she can't be loose,
# But I am really your friend,
# I'm just trying to tell you the truth,
# Don't hate the game or the playa',
# The one that's changin is you
# [Chorus:]
# How come, we don't even talk no mo',
# And you don't even call no mo',
# We don't barely keep in touch at all,

# And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,

# Ain't no way, no how,
# This bullshit can't be true,
# We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's you
# (Proof)
# [Verse Three]
# We gettin lonely at the top
# cuz my homie had to stop
# now we actin like i gotta live only for the block
# and homies in the hood only see me on the tube
# so they gossip on the porch, get ta speakin all rude
# fools i used to rap with, all expect magic
# like my finger get ta snappin and *poof* it just happen
# but Proof its just actin, at the party were stoned
# shady made it so my babys aint starvin at home
# see the devil in your grin, since the ghetto we been friends
# forever, real intelegience, thats forever till the end
# I peep the hatred in your eyes and the Satan in your lie
# aint wastin my time with these snakes in disguise
# (How come) when you talk its with bitter respite
# (And how come) its my fault for what you did with your life
# and every time i go to hear you and play you look away
# we barely embrace, you cant even look me in my face
# [Chorus:]
# How come, we don't even talk no mo',
# And you don't even call no mo',
# We don't barely keep in touch at all,
# And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo',
# And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,

# I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
# Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
# tellin your boys that I'm on crack
# I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
# So put my tape back on the rack
# Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
# I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
# But see me on the street and duck
# Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
# Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
# [Verse Two: Eminem]
# I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone
# I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
# I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
# I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
# Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview
# I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
# I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
# This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
# But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
# Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
# Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion
# Pathological liar, blowin shit out of proportion
# The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
# Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
# Half animal, half man
# Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
# With more holes than an Afghan
# [Chorus]
# [Verse Three: Eminem]
# Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
# I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
# I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin
# Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
# Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
# I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher
# I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
# Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes
# In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush
# Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
# Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
# Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
# Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
# Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
# I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median
# Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in
# [Chorus]

# I love you mamma
# I realy miss you now,

# Its Dallas today
# who knows were tomorrow
# I gotta write

# I want you with me mamma
# mamma you gotta come with me
# gotta see what its like
# you gotta meet the lable
# see what its all about
# I love you mamma
# you gotta come with me
# you gotta see what its like
# this is so gay!
# (this is not by eminem it is by me his twin sister Alema)
> Eminem
# You still love me?
# Take this. [2 guns c***]
# You ready? 1.. 2.. 3! [2 shots]
# The more you, put me through,
# The more it makes me wanna come back to you,
# You say you hate me, I just love you more,
# You don't want me, I just want you more,
# I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,
# I know it's sad but it's makin me happy,
# The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
# Cuz you love me, and I love you more.
# [Verse 1]
# It's sick, but who could ever predict,
# We'd be doin' the same sh**,
# We say we do it for our baby but we don't,
# We do it for us, it's lust,
# Cuz neither one of us trusts each other,
# So we f*** 'til we bust,
# Then we cuss each other, out,
# We know what it's about,
# Shout 'til I throw you out the house,
# You throw me out the house,
# I throw you on the couch,
# Punch you in the mouth,
# Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT,
# And apologize after,
# Laughter, pain, it's insane,
# We're back in the same chapter again,
# And it's sad but it's true,
# When I'm layin' here with you,
# There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.
# [Verse 2]
# Cuz I hate you, do you hate me?
# Good cuz you're so f***in' beautiful when you're angry,
# It makes me wanna just take you,
# And just throw you on the bed,
# And f*** you like I don't even know you,
# You f*** other people, and I f*** other people,
# You a s*** but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,
# We're both evil in our ways,
# But neither one of us would ever admit it,
# Cuz one of us would have one up on the other,
# So forget it,
# We can make accusations, people spread rumors,
# But they ain't got proof,
# 'Til they do it's just the two of us,
# It's you and me, cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me,
# But you gotta believe me to a degree,
# Cuz if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it,
# Yeah I would cuz the sex is too damn good,
# If I ran who would I run to,
# That would be this soft and warm,
# So it's off and on, usually more off than on,
# But at least we know that we share this common bond,
# You're the only one I can f*** without a condom on,
# I hope, the only reason that I cope,
# Is cuz of that fact,
# And plus I can bust in that,
# And that's why...
# [Verse 3]
# I could never understand it,
# That's why I don't try,
# From junior high until we both die,
# It's silly ho why must we try,
# Is it really so rough,
# That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,
# Try to pull each other's legs,
# Until the other begs,
# We're liein' to ourselves,
# That's the beauty of it yeah,
# Cuz we truly love each other,
# That's why we always fight,
# And all we do is shove each other,
# Every other f***in' night,
# And it's clear it ain't gonna change,
# It's pent up rage,
# We both have,
# We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,
# We've both been,
# Someone else's someone else,
# Problem is neither one wants help,
# It's an addiction and it can't be fixed,
# Our family's mixed up,
# There's a baby sister in the mix,
# And it hurts cuz the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,
# And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know sh**,
# And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,
# On every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,
# All the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,
# What you put me through, f***in' whoopdy doo,
# But I won't be made a fool of,
# If this is true love,
# You wouldn't do what,
# You did last time,
# You wouldn't screw up,
# This time,
# Cuz this time girl,
# I'm tellin you what,
# You do it again I'm f***in you up,
# No matter what...
# What you say, what you do,
# I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you,
# No matter where you run, I'll be right there,
# Right behind you, in your nightmares,
# All the flowers, and the candy,
# All the times that you threw it back at me,
# You say you hate me, you gon' hate me more,
# When you find out, can't escape me w****.

# Ya mother...fuckin' faggot.

# Rest in peace.
# We'll never forget about you...fuckin homo.
# We'll still remember.
# There once was a man who liked to jump around. (jump around) (yo)
# But he got too old to jump up and down. (up and down)
# (so then what happened?)
# So he put the mic down and picked a guitar up. (picked a guitar up)
# (and then he what?)
# Started singin the blues like there was no tomorrow. (no tomorrow)
# (come on)
# Left his boys in the house of pain. (in the house of pain) (biach)
# It was the wisest decision he ever made. (ever made)
# But the dumbest thing that he could ever do. (he could ever do) (was what?)
# Was try ta book a 380 on thoes that act shady, tell me now whatchu
# gonna do. (now whatchu gonna do?) (haha)
# Cuz I remember all those years (yeah)
# How it was when you were here (c'mon)
# I remember how it was (what)
# How it was when you were young (yeah)
# Yesterday was so long ago (long ago)
# Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now dont nobody wanna hear your
# old ass sing no more.
# I remember back when you had the knack. (had the knack) (hahahahaha)
# And I remember when you had your first heart attack. (heart attack)
# (*wheezing noise)
# I was right there laughin' when i heard the news. (heard the news)
# I just wish the cardiac would've murdered you. (would've murdered you)

# Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now dont nobody wanna hear your

# Remember back in '94,
# Like right before Miss Everlast was Whitey Ford,
# Before his heart attack had him on life support. (beep beep)
# When house of pain was out of fame,
# Like someone doused the flame,
# And they became destined
# To never jump around again.
# Or even further back,
# When I first had heard the knack,
# When you were down with syndicate.
# I went to get the shit,
# Man I was into it.
# But then you went, and took your style, and switched the shit.
# Now you sound ridiculous.
# You dickless piece of shit.
# How could you diss me bitch? (huh?)
# I liked you.
# Thought you was alright for a white dude.
# Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you,
# Started rhymin' then you left the room and didnt say goodbye or nuthin.
# Like you mad that someone else was white and tryin' ta rhyme
# or somethin'.
# I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin ta steal your light or nuthin.
# But your a homosexual, white rappin' Irish (unknown)
# Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a (unknown) too.
# Then I'd be confused as you,
# And I wouldn't know what to do.
# What's up witchu?
# I never fucked witchu,
# Why would you fuck with me?
# Knowin' I could rap circles around you,
# What? Is you nuts as me?
# Plus I can sing better than you,
# And I don't fuckin' sing.
# And probably play guitar better,
# And I aint never touched a string.
# But I aint mad at you.
# I'd hate me too if I was you.
# I'm what you used to be.
# Shit you was me in '92.
# So every time I write a lyric, I'ma think of you.
# And maybe that'll help me know what it's like to sing the blues.
# (ladi  da)
# Cuz I remember all those years.
# How it was when you were here. (I know)
# I remember how it was. (how it was)
# How it was when you were young. (when you were young)
# Yesterday was so long ago. (long ago)
# Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now dont nobody wanna hear your
# old ass sing no more.
# Cuz I remember all those years. (what)
# How it was when you were here. (come on)

# A lot of people ask me.. am I afraid of death..
# Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
# I don't want to die yet
# A lot of people think.. that I worship the devil..
# that I do all types of.. retarded shit
# Look, I can't change the way I think
# And I can't change the way I am
# But if I offended you? Good
# Cause I still don't give a fuck
# I'm zonin off of one joint, stoppin a limo
# Hopped in the window, shoppin a demo at gunpoint
# A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
# Fuck a needle, here's a sword, bodypierce with this
# Livin amuk, never givin a fuck
# Gimme the keys I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
# But I smoke dope in a cab
# I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
# Come back the next week and re-open your scab (YEAH!)
# A killer instinct runs in the blood
# Emptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud
# I've calmed down now  I was heavy once into drugs
# I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
# My brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn
# The rest of my body's still bein operated on
# I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin this rhyme
# Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time
# For all the weed that I've smoked   yo this blunt's for you
# To all the people I've offended   yeah fuck you too!
# To all the friends I used to have   yo I miss my past
# But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
# For all the drugs that I've done   yo I'm still gon' do
# To all the people I've offended   yeah fuck you too!
# For everytime I reminisce   yo I miss my past
# But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass
# I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
# And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
# I'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles
# And pull you apart from both angles
# I wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins
# And bust open like broken water mains
# So tell Saddam not to bother with makin another bomb
# Cause I'm crushin the whole world in my palm
# Got your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm
# So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
# Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
# And the pants to match ("Here momma try em on")
# I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives,
# a brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
# (Shittin on rappers) Causin hospital accidents
# God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again
# For all the weed that I've smoked   yo this blunt's for you
# To all the people I've offended   yeah fuck you too!
# To all the friends I used to have   yo I miss my past
# But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
# For all the drugs that I've done   yo I'm still gon' do
# To all the people I've offended   yeah fuck you too!
# For everytime I reminisce   yo I miss my past
# But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass
# I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
# Spend a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
# Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
# I can't rap anymore - I just murdered the alphabet
# Drug sickness got me doin some bugged twitches
# I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
# I don't rap to get the women - fuck bitches
# Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
# Never ran with a click   I'm a posse
# Kamikaze, strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me
# From the second I was born, my momma lost me
# I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
# I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
# My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
# Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
# Fuck, I was born during the earthquake
# For all the weed that I've smoked   yo this blunt's for you
# To all the people I've offended   yeah fuck you too!
# To all the friends I used to have   yo I miss my past
# But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
# For all the drugs that I've done   yo I'm still gon' do

# Show these mother fuckers what time it is baby!
# [Eminem]
# I used to be a lonely man, [only mad]
# Until I got a million dollars, shit
# Now if i only had some fucking hair
# I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
# out of Tupac's chest
# Before the ambulance came too late to do it
# I'm trying to grow it back again
# It was an accident
# I had my back against a fan
# Who chopped it off in Amsterdam
# I hate the straight jacket it aint latching
# They can't lock it
# so they stapled my hand
# To my pants pockets
# The cell's padded and battered like
# Someone else had it before me
# And just kept throwing them fucking selfs at it
# My head is aching
# I'm dedicated to medication
# but this med is taking to long to bring me this sedadation? (Come on!)
# Anyway I got down with Dre (What up?)
# The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
# Running up and down the street screaming
# "Fuck the Police!"
# When you still had your mother's fucking Nipple
# Stuck in your teeth(fucking baby)
# Became a role model after Colorado
# Now all they do is follow me around
# And holla "BRAVO!!"
# Hell yea I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
# Suck my dick, bitch
# I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't
# Cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place
# So put a sock in it
# With your fake-ass Tupac image
# You faggots ain't tough
# you just get drunk and become talkative(Wanna Fight?)
# I'm probably the akwardest alcoholic talking
# Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
# So when you see me on your block
# Stumbling, mumbling a bunch of dumb shit
# Like my drunk uncle does

# So why on earth would I need drugs

# The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
# I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron (AHH!)
# Psych I'm just joking, for christ sakes
# Dont get so bent out of shape
# Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
# Some people just don't get it
# But I won't let it upset me
# Cause they don't know better
# They don't know what the fuck its like to be so fed up
# and fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
# My mind's got a mind of it's own
# Sometimes I can't find it at home

# And Dirty Dozen watches over me
# So try some dumb shit

# and shove his head in the fan blade
# Don't ever tell me what
# I can and what I can't say
# Or change cause of the
# Age range in my fan base
# Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit
# Quit fucking buying it
# I'm tired bitch
# I'm dying to quit
# Hip Hop is universal now
# It's all commercial now
# It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
# But now the white kids like it
# So they tell me I can buy it
# But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent
# Either that or booed, thats why I keep an attitude
# And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
# I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge

# You better, get rid of that nine, it aint gonna help
# What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
# I'm waitin for hell like hell shit I'm anxious as hell
# Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
# I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
# At thirteen I was puttin shells in a gauge on a shelf
# I used to, get punched and bullied on my block
# Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mail box
# I used to give a, fuck, now I could give a fuckless
# What do I think of success? It sucks too much press I'm stressed
# Too much cess with agress too upset it's just too much mess
# I guess I must just blew up quick, yes
# Grew up quick, no, was raised right, whatever you say is wrong
# Whatever I say is right
# You think of my name now whenever you say hi
# Became a commodity because I'm W H I
# T E, cuz MTV was so friendly to me, can't wait till Kim sees me
# Now is it worth it? Look at my life how is it perfect?
# Read my lips bitch, what, my mouth isn't workin?

# It's a, sick world we live in these days
# Slim for pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!
# Sheez you guys are so sensitive
# Slim it's touchy subject try and just don't mention it
# Mind with no sense in it, tried to get so frenetic
# Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smokin 'em
# Wit my windows tinted, wit nine limos rented, doin lines of coke in 'em
# Wit a bunch of guys hoppin out all high and indo scented
# And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me
# CHORUS 4X

# I take seven -- from ----- stand 'em all in line
# Add an AK - 47, a revolver, a nine
# A mack 11 and an all assault a problem of mine

# Cuz I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
# As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
# And by the way, *N'SYNC why do they sing
# Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
# Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
# Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
# It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
# Cuz all these fans screamin is makin my ears ring
# So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
# Longer than the rumor that I was stickin it to Christina
# Cuz if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
# It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy you know this!
# I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
# I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her

# Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
# One time for your mother fucking mind, we represent the 313
# You know what I'm saying?, cause they don't know shit about this
# For the 9-6
# Verse 1:
# Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
# To get your brain relaxin, cause they be actin maniac in action
# A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
# You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun
# My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
# I travel through your mind until you spine like siren drills
# I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants
# With some ex rappers till their spinal column disconnects
# We disindex and check the monologue, turn your system up
# Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smoke
# This is the season for noise pollution contamination
# Examination of more cartoons than animation
# My lamination of narration
# Hit's a snare and bass in the track fucked up rapper interrogation
# When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing
# I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...

# Chorus:
# You heard of hell well I was sent from it
# I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments

# I'm Infinite
# Verse 2:
# Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
# I got some meat to mince fruit to stomp in and two feet to rinse
# I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil all your fans
# I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
# My coil hands around this microphone are lethal

# MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
# Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one

# There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
# Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases

# Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
# My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
# So I'm assuming all responsibility

# Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
# Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
# No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical

# A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
# This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam

# [Verse: B.I.G.]
# Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
# And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get
# With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
# Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's
# Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots
# On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
# Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
# Flash the Roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose
# Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
# Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
# Just in case a nigga wanna act out
# I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out
# That's a real nigga for ya
# [Chorus: 50 Cent] (2x)
# We the realest nigga
# 50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
# Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
# Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
# Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!
# [Verse: B.I.G.]
# When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
# Just in case dread wanna riff
# He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
# Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
# That's a real nigga for ya
# Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
# Spit at the D.A. cause fuck what she say
# She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
# Up North found first stop for the town
# of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill
# You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover

# When I was young my M.O. was to go hail the Henny
# And even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man
# I cut ya new case, and tell her ass "catch me if you can"
# Don't let your people feel your awkward
# I tame I'm not lame
# Get gassed up to get blast up
# Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
# Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North Seed Papa
# 50 Cent, I'll break yo ass off propa'
# This new place like home, New York - New York
# I run this city, I don't dance around like Diddy
# Niggas is giddy, till they act smack silly
# Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama really
# Pushy niggas get hard lip syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly
# Even the hood they feel me {*gun cocked*} hah! I'm on fire!
# Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit
# Even bootlegged you know, bump my shit, bitch!
# [Chorus] (2x)
# We the realest nigga

# Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga

# Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
# I'm up all night but everything is alright (It's alright)
# It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
# It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
# It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
# I'm up all night but everything is alright (It's alright)
# It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)

# Verse 1: Eminem
# One day I plan to be a family man happily married
# I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
# Till I'm glad to be buried
# And leave this crazy world
# And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
# It may be early to be planning this stuff
# Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
# Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough
# I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
# My hands have been cuffed
# But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
# Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
# I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough
# And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
# My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased
# With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
# I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
# Way before my baby is able to crawl
# I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
# To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
# I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
# Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q
# Eye-Kyu:
# Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)

# It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

# Verse 2: Eminem
# I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
# Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep
# Praying for sleep
# Dreaming with a watering mouth
# Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
# In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts
# With the root of all evil
# I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
# And make them do shit illegal
# For these Grant's and Jackson's
# These transactions explain a man's actions
# But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity
# Through God and there's a wish he granted me
# He showed me how to cope with the stress
# And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
# Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
# To selling dope with the rest
# I quit smoking cess to open my chest
# Life is stressful inside this cesspool
# Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
# My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
# He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
# Kids attract static, children with automatics
# Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
# I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
# I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
# It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
# But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth
# Eye-Kyu:
# Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)

# [Girls voice: (Talking over the singing)]
# Jealous!?!  What he mean jealous, know what I'm saying?
# He just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what I'm saying?
# Girls don't buy him no clothes, He bought that ho some clothes!!
# He don't buy me no clothes, Nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
# I mean, What do I got to be jealous for?
# He ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time
# He has no career move, I mean...
# [Verse 1:]
# I come home every single day from working double shifts
# And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
# I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
# Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
# Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me
# It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
# Plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues
# To many tissues, for my feelings you misuse
# I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
# I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things
# So what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
# You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
# I used to love your company now you always bugging me
# For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
# So I'ma wait for your evacuation
# Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
# See I've never been so sure, and your just insecure
# So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
# I recommend you take your things and check them in
# Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What?
# [Chorus: Men Singing]
# Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy (8X)
# [Women's Voice: (Talking over singing)]
# Fuck you and what you going through
# Fuck Eminem, he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man
# Me and Eminem don't need nothing but my and his money
# Immature, Me?  Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang
# Know what I'm saying?  He just mad cause I'm getting it all night
# Jealous of me, know what I'm saying?  That's what I'm talking about
# Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy
# [Verse 2:]
# I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
# I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
# Until the day I started following your feetprints
# And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
# It made complete sense, there's someone else you like
# So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?
# And you was like, (sampled) **I need a new nigga**
# Someone rich that I could follow
# And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
# Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted
# I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
# I was an open target, you play comedian
# And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again
# And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife
# All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
# He goes, "You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now"
# Take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down
# You run me down and now your trying to apologize
# For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
# Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
# Jealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it...
# [Chorus: Men Singing]
# Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy (12X)

# if you had one shot one opportunity
# to fight for your country will you fight
# or will you go down with no honor

# Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
# My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
# You can be black, white or a albino yeah
# You can have corn rows inside your hair
# I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
# This bottle of wine goes upside your head
# A little bit psycho, but I know that
# Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it
# See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
# I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
# I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
# You can just keep makin them tired old threats
# A little bit like the boy you cried wolf yeah
# See me, but don't dare to try no shit

# Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
# I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
# If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
# If you keep comin back, that only means you know you lost the fight
# They wanna talk shit, let em talk shit, cause they talk shit
# Knowin deep down, they really just wanna squash it
# Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin in dog shit
# And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
# But the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em'
# And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum'

# My dad chased monsters from the dark
# He checked underneath my bed
# He could lift me with one arm
# Way up over top of his head
# He could loosen rusty bolts
# With a quick turn of his wrench
# He pulled splinters from his hand
# And never even flinched
# In thirteen years I'd never seen him cry
# But the day that grandpa died, I realized
# Unsinkable ships sink
# Unbreakable walls break
# Sometimes the things you think would never happen
# Happen just like that
# Unbendable steel bends
# If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
# I've learned to never underestimate
# The impossible
# Then there was my junior year
# Billy had a brand new car
# It was late, the road was wet
# I guess the curve was just too sharp
# I walked away without a scratch
# They brought the helicopter in
# Billy couldn't feel his legs
# Said he'd never walk again
# But Billy said he would and his mom and daddy prayed
# And the day we graduated, he stood up to say:
# Unsinkable ships sink
# Unbreakable walls break
# Sometimes the things you think would never happen
# Happen just like that
# Unbendable steel bends
# If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
# I've learned to never underestimate
# The impossible
# So don't tell me that it's over
# Don't give up on you and me
# Cuz there's no such thing as hopeless
# If you believe:
# Unsinkable ships sink
# Unbreakable walls break
# Sometimes the things you think would never happen
# Happen just like that
# Unbendable steel bends
# If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
# I've learned to never underestimate
# The impossible

# Whoah!
# A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
# and like, back and forth because ah
# this is... what you thought it wasn't...
# It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
# I be the F-R-O the double G (coughing in background)
# And check out the man he goes by the name of er...
# Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
# I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady.
# I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
# Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer.
# You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
# You ain't go' sell two copies if you press a double album.
# Admit it, fuck it, while we comin out in the open
# I'm doin acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin dope then;
# My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
# I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
# Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash
# Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
# Bitch, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
# You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
# The Proof is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
# I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman
# Chorus:
# So when you see me on your block with two glocks
# Screamin "Fuck the World" like Tupac
# I just don't give a fuck!!
# Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
# tellin your boys that I'm on crack
# I just don't give a fuck!!
# So put my tape back on the rack
# Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
# I just don't give a fuck!!
# But see me on the street and duck
# Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
# Cause I just don't give a fuck!!
# I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Milkbone
# I'm Everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
# I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
# I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
# Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview
# I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
# I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
# This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
# But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
# Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
# Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion
# Pathological liar, blowin shit outta proportion
# The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
# Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
# Half animal, half man
# Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
# With more holes than an Afghan
# (Chorus)
# Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
# I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
# I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin
# Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion.
# Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
# I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher
# I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
# Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes
# In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush
# Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
# Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
# Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
# Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
# Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
# I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median
# Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

# Come on hey hey we goin' to the beach
# grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat.
# Where's Mama?
# She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
# Oh that smell dada must have run over a skunk.
# now I know what you're thinkin':
# it's kind of late to go swimmin'
# but you know your mama she's one of those types of women
# who does crazy things and if she don't get her way she'll throw a
# fit
# don't play with daddy's toy knife, honey, let go of it
# and don't be so upset, why you actin' bashful?
# don't you wanna help dadda build a sand castle?
# and mama said she wants to show how far she can float,
# and don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
# it's just a little scratch it don't hurt,
# her was eatin' dinner while you was sleepin' and spilled ketchup on
# her shirt
# mama's messy, isn't she, we'll let her wash off in the water
# and me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?
# just the two of us (sung) repeat 8-9 times
# there's a place called heaven and a place called hell,
# a place called prison and a place called jail,
# and dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one,
# 'cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
# and you don't want a brother do ya? (Na)
# maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better, I'll
# explain it to ya.
# but for now we'll just say that mama was real, real bad
# she was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad
# but I still feel sad that I put her in time out,
# sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin' to climb out
# I told you it's okay, hey hey, wanna baba?
# take a night-night, nana-boo, goo-goo ga-ga
# humma goo-goo caca, dad'll change your dighty,
# clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty.
# you're dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water,
# '97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter.
# just the two of us (sung)
# wake up sleepy head we're here,
# before we play, we're gonna take mama for a little walk along the
# pier.
# baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea,
# mama's too sleepy to hear you screamin' in her ear,
# that's why you can't get her to wake,
# but don't worry, dada made a nice bed for mama at the bottom of the
# lake,
# here, you wanna help dada tie a rope around this rock?
# we'll tie it to her footsies then will roll her off the dock.
# ready now, here we go, on the count of three,
# one, two, three...weeeeeeeeee
# there goes mama splashin' in the water,
# no more fightin' your dad, no more restrainin' order,
# no more step dada, no more new brother,
# blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her,
# we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk,
# but first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk,
# just the two of us (sung)

# [Mr. Mackey] (Eric Cartman)
# And everyone should get along..
# Okay children quiet down, quiet down
# Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
# His name is Mr. Shady
# Children quiet down please
# Brian don't throw that (SHUT UP!)
# Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
# while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (HE'S GOT AIDS!)
# Good luck Mr. Shady
# [Eminem]
# Hi there little boys and girls (FUCK YOU!)
# Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
# But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
# Say hi Bob! ("Hi Bob") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
# and he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
# but his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
# And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
# and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock
# when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
# Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (AHH!)
# And even if they escaped and they got the cops
# the ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
# 'til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
# when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
# But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off
# But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker
# Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
# You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr."
# He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
# and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
# But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
# they never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
# And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana,
# and what it might do to you
# So see if the squirrels want any - it's bad for you
# [Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]
# See children, drugs are bahhhd (c'mon)
# and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (ask him man)
# and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right)
# She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)
# So kids say no to drugs (that's right)
# So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh)
# Then there's really nothin else to say (sing along)
# Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?
# [Eminem]
# My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
# FUCK NO you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
# Speakin of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
# Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
# If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
# Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
# and spinal fluid is vital, you won't get it back
# So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
# Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
# After hangin out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
# and decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys
# and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
# Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
# and his eyes roll back in his skull {*blblblblblb*}
# His back starts tah - look like the McDonald's Arches
# He's on Donald's carpet, layin horizontal barfin {*BLEH*}
# And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him
# "Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"
# cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
# So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
# Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
# and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga
# And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
# So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you
# [Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]
# See children, drugs are bahhhd (that's right)
# and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (that's right)
# and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can)
# She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)
# So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack)
# So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)
# And there's really nothin else to say (but umm)
# Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?
# [Eminem]
# And last but not least, one of the most humungous
# problems among young people today, is fungus
# It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off,
# bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it
# Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
# And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em..
# And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
# Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair
# (Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire
# Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
# And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
# Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus
# Ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue (How come?)
# cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!!)
# See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
# But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
# But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D.
# They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee
# and get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault
# So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't,
# cause I'm bad for you
# [Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]
# See children, drugs are bahhhd (uh-huh)
# and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (put that down)
# and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can ask)
# She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (and she will)
# So kids say no to drugs (say no)
# So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do)
# And there's really nothin else to say (that's right)
# Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?
# [Mr. Mackey] (Eric Cartman)
# Come on children, clap along (SHUT UP!)
# Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin dick!)
# Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
# So don't do drugs (Kiss my motherfuckin ass!)
# so there'll be more for me (Hippie! God damnit!)
# (Mushrooms killed Kenny! *fart* Ewww, ahhh!)
# (So, fucked up, right now..)

# When I was just a little baby boy,
# my momma used to tell me these crazy things
# She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
# she used to tell me he hated me
# But then I got a little bit older
# and I realized, she was the crazy one
# But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it
# cause that's just the way she was
# They said I can't rap about being broke no more
# They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
# (AHHH!) Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
# 'til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
# (AHHH!) These motherfuckers are thinking I'm playing
# Thinking I'm saying the shit cause I'm thinking it just to be saying it
# (AHHH!) Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
# I'ma pull +YOU+ to this bullet, and put it through you
# (AHHH!) Shut up slut, you're causing too much chaos
# Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?
# "Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore,
# snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
# You god damn right BITCH, and now it's too late
# I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
# I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches

# Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
# Girls neither - you ain't nothing but a slut to me
# Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
# We ain't gon' never stop beefing I don't squash the beef
# You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
# for popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't said
# But when they kill me - I'm bringing the world with me
# Bitches too! You ain't nothing but a girl to me
# .. I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (cause why?)
# Cause Shady, will fucking kill you (ah-haha)
# I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
# Cause Shady, will fucking kill you..

# Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you

# I ain't "acid rap," but I rap on acid
# Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
# WHOOPS! Is that a subliminal hint? NO!
# Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
# Eminem offend? NO! Eminem insult
# And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
# to do it again, THEN, if he does it again
# you'll probably end up jumping out of something up on the 10th
# (Ahhhhhhhh!) Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus

# A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times

# out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in
# [Chorus (first line starts "Or I'ma kill you!")]

# Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
# Cause lady's screams keep creeping in Shady's dreams
# And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
# this eighty G's a week to say the same things TWEECE!
# TWICE? Whatever, I hate these things
# Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
# Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
# just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
# FUCK THAT! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
# from fat bitch to off seventy-thousand pounds of her
# from principal to the student body and counselor

# I'M READY TO MAKE EVERYONE'S THROAT SAG
# You faggots keep egging me on

# Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
# We all fall down...
# [Chorus]
# Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
# We all fall down like toy soldiers
# Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
# But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
# [Verse 1]
# I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
# Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
# I am never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
# Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
# I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
# I'm supposed to set an example
# I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
# If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
# That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
# There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
# I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
# It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
# And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
# I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
# And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
# This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
# That was never my object for someone to get killed
# Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
# It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
# I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' Suge
# And that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
# And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
# Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
# So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
# While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
# Like fuck it i understand this is business
# And this shit just isn't none of my business
# But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cuz
# [Chorus]
# [Verse 2]
# There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
# And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
# But now it's elevated cuz once you put someone's kids in it
# The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
# It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
# We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
# Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
# And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
# Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
# Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
# Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
# Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
# Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his ressurection
# Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
# But now he's fucked the game up cuz one of the ways I came up
# Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
# Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
# Well fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
# But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
# That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
# And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
# We still have soldiers that's on the front line
# That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
# Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
# We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
# To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
# To have Runyan Avenue, soldiers up in our corners
# Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
# But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
# It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
# Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict
# I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
# But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
# I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
# If ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then I can
# Cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'
# I'm not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cuz
# [Chorus]

# Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
# To seize everything you ever wanted one moment
# Would you capture it or just let it slip?
# Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
# There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
# He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
# To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
# What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
# He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
# He's chokin', how everybody's jokin' now
# The clock's run out, time's up, over bl-oww!
# Snap back to reality, Oh! There goes gravity,
# Oh!, there goes rabbit, he choked
# He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy
# No, he won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
# It don't matter, he's dope
# He knows that, but he's broke
# He's so stacked that he knows
# When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
# Back to the lab again, yo
# This whole rhapsody
# Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
# [Chorus:]
# You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
# You own it, you better never let it go
# You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
# You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
# You own it, you better never let it go
# You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better,
# His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
# This world is mine for the taking
# Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
# A normal life is borin', but superstardom's close to post mortem,
# It only grows harder, only grows hotter
# He blows us all over, these ho's is all on him,
# Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
# Lonely roads, God only knows
# He's grown farther from home, he's no father
# He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
# But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
# These ho's don't want him no mo', he's cold product
# They moved on to the next schmo who flows
# He nose dove and sold nada
# So the soap opera is told and unfolds
# I suppose it's old partner, but the beat goes on...
# Da da dum da dum da da
# [Chorus:]
# You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
# You own it, you better never let it go (go)
# You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, you better
# You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
# You own it, you better never let it go
# You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo, you better
# No more games, I'm-a change what you call rage,
# Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like 2 dogs caged
# I was playin, in the beginning, the mood all changed
# I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
# But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cypher
# Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
# All the pain inside amplified by the
# Fact that I can't get by with my 9 to
# 5 and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
# 'Cause man, these godamn food stamps don't buy diapers
# And it's no movie, there's no Mikai Pheiffer, this is my life
# And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
# Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus
# Teeter-totter caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
# Baby mama drama's screamin' on and
# Too much for me to wanna
# Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
# Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail
# I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
# Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
# Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
# I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
# So here I go, it's my shot
# Feet fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
# [Chorus:]
# You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
# You own it, you better never let it go
# You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
# You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
# You own it, you better never let it go

# and its sad but its true, when im layin here wit'chu
# there aint nothin anyone could ever say or ever do cuz
# the more you put me through
# the more it makes me wanna come back to you
# you say you hate me, i just love you more
# you dont want me, i just want you more
# i buy you flowers
# you throw them at me
# i know its sad but its making me happy
# the more that you slap me,
# the more that it turns me on
# cuz you love me
# and i love you more
# cuz i hate you, do you hate me?
# good cuz you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry
# it makes me, wanna just take you
# and just throw you on the bed
# and fuck you like i dont even know you
# you fuck other people and i fuck other people
# you're a slut but im equal, ima mut
# we're both evil in our ways
# but neither one of us would ever admit it
# cuz one of us would have one up on the other, so forget it
# people make, accusations, people spread rumors,
# but they aint got proof
# till they do, its just the two of us, its you and me
# cuz any chick can say that shes screwin me
# but you gotta believe me to a degree cuz you're in deep
# if you didnt i wouldn't be hitting
# yeah i would cuz the sex is just too damn good
# if i ran, who would i run to?
# who would be this soft and warm
# so its off and on, usually more off than on
# but at least we know,
# that we share this common bond
# you're the only one i could fuck without a condom on
# i hope, the only reason that i cope
# is cuz of that fact and plus i can bust in that
# and thats why
# the more you put me through
# the more it makes me wanna come back to you
# you say you hate me, i just love you more
# you dont want me, i just want you more
# i buy you flowers
# you throw them at me
# i know its sad but its making me happy
# the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
# cuz you love me
# and i love you more
# i can never understand it,
# thats why i dont try
# from junior high, until we both die
# its silly oh why, must we try?
# is it really so rough?
# did we must and always call
# each others billy-goat's gruff?
# try to pull each others legs, until the other begs,
# were lying to ourselves
# thats the beauty of it, yeah
# cuz we truely love each other
# thats why we always fight,
# and all we do is shove each other
# every other fuckin night
# and its clear, it aint gonna change
# this pin up rage, we both have,
# and we both feel like we've been upstaged
# by someone else, we've both been someone else
# with someone else
# the problem is, neither one wont tell
# its an addiction, and it cant be fixed
# our familys mixed up
# theres baby sister in the mix
# and it hurts, cuz the pieces to the puzzle dont fit
# and anybody who thinks he knows us doesn't know shit
# and they're probably just tired of hearing it all the time,
# on every song, every lyric and every rhyme,
# all the hoop-lah, all of the whoopty woo,
# what you put me through, fuckin whoopty-doo
# but i wont be made a fool of,
# if this is true love, you wouldnt do what you did last time,
# you wouldnt screw up this time,
# cuz this time, girl im telling you what,
# you do it again im fucking you up,
# no matter what
# what you say, what you do,
# ima hunt you down till i find you
# no matter where you run
# ill be right there, right behind you
# and in your nightmares i surround you.
# i buy you flowers, and candy
# all the times that you threw them back at me
# told me you hate me
# you gonna hate me more
# when you find out,
# you cant escape me whorrrre
# the more you, put me through
# the more it makes me wanna come back to you
# you say you hate me, i just love you more.
# you dont want me, i just want you more.
# i buy you flowers
# you throw them at me
# i know its sad but its making me happy.
# the more that you slap me,
# the more that it turns me on,
# cuz you love me
# and i love you more.

# Warning, this shit's gon be rated R, restricted
# You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted
# Doctor slapped my momma, "Bitch you got a sick kid"
# Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
# Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
# Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
# I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
# Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
# "Murder Murder Redrum"
# Brain size of a bread crumb
# Which drug will I end up dead from
# Inebriated, till my stress is eleviated
# "How in the fuck can Eminem and shady be related?"
# Illiterate, illigitimate shit spitter
# Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
# Jumped out (Ahhhh!) killed the bitch and did her
# Use to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was little'er
# Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fuckin Bette Midler
# Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
# Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler
# Didn't Ya?  Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her
# [Chorus: Eminem + (Redman Sample) - 2X]
# [E]
# I'm low down and I'm shiftee!
# "And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
# and ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from.."
# I lace tunes, I'm out this world like Space Moons
# With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
# Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
# Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippits
# Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
# I'ma let your grandpa hit it
# Mix it up with cocaine so her can't forget it
# Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
# But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
# So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
# Losing all of my leverage
# Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
# Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage
# Smoked out like Eckridge
# Band just making my neck itch
# What the fuck? Gimme the tech bitch
# You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
# Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
# Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
# Slap hips, support domestic violence
# Beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
# I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen's really dust smoking?
# If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in
# [Chorus]
# My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
# Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
# I'm out the game, put the second string in
# This Brandy got my swinging
# Bobbing back and forth like a penguin
# Delinquent, toking microphones with Broken English
# Make your mama be like "Ohh! This is good! Who sing this?"
# "Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it
# It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit."
# It was predicted by a medic
# I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic
# Living off liquid Triametic
# Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
# Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anasin
# Frozen Manaquin, posted stiffer than a statue
# I think I'm dying, God is that you?
# Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
# Take me to ER ASAP for and IV
# Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
# They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon come is Tupac
# It's politics, it's all a fix
# Setup by these white blue collared hicks
# Just to make a dollar off of black music
# With a subliminal ball of tricks
# But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks
# [Chorus]

# Okay folks, enough with the gay jokes,
# Especially from a gay broke bitch yourself, eh loc,
# His styles do do he worked here longer than me,
# And I get paid more than you do,
# Dawg take a seat, what's this guy standing in line for,
# He ain't got money to eat, check this out yo yo,
# This guy cashed his whole check, and bought one hoho,
# Fucking homo, little maggot, you can hack it,
# Paul's gay, you're a faggot,
# At least he admits it, don't even risk it,
# This guy starving to death, someone get him a biscuit,
# I don't know what they told you "Mike"
# You must have them cornrows rolled to tight
# This job, you wanna quit but you can't
# You've worked at this plant so long, you're a plant,
# Look at your god damn boots!
# For Christ sakes they're starting to grow roots!
# In this mic you get faded,
# you look like a pissed off rapper who never made it,
# and why you fucking with the gay guy gee,
# When really your the one who's got the HIV,
# Man I'm done with this clown, hes soft, fuck it,
# I'll let homegirl finish you off,

# Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if
# You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
# If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice

# Verse 2: Denaun Porter
# Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is

# When you got niggas hiding in your closet
# I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely
# Verse 3: 3
# I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
# So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
# And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
# Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
# I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said "Hey Bitch..
# Haven't I seen you before?", looked at my nigga
# Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
# And said "Oh it's like that?"
# She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
# She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit
# She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number
# She asked could I give her mine two
# Got to the crib and called her up
# We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck
# I said "Maxine check this out,
# Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out"
# Got to the crib she let me in
# She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
# I said "Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things"
# What the fuck are you doing?
# So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing
# As she went for my midsection
# I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
# Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work
# Before I hit it she said
# "3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass"
# I said "What is it, another nigga?  It's ok"
# She said "No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS"
# I got up out
# Denaun: Hey, Maxine
# Maxine: What
# Denaun: You thinking about sucking my dick?
# Maxine: Yeah for a small price

# You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
# If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
# But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
# To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
# Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it
# While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it  (Maxine!!)
# Verse 2: Denaun Porter
# Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is
# To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit
# You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night
# You say it's gonna stop but it..  just.. slows.. down
# And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this
# Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
# You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
# When you got niggas hiding in your closet
# I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely
# Verse 3: 3
# I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
# So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
# And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
# Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
# I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said "Hey Bitch..
# Haven't I seen you before?", looked at my nigga
# Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
# And said "Oh it's like that?"
# She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
# She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit
# She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number
# She asked could I give her mine two
# Got to the crib and called her up
# We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck
# I said "Maxine check this out,
# Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out"
# Got to the crib she let me in
# She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
# I said "Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things"
# What the fuck are you doing?
# So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing
# As she went for my midsection
# I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
# Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work
# Before I hit it she said
# "3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass"
# I said "What is it, another nigga?  It's ok"
# She said "No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS"
# I got up out
# Denaun: Hey, Maxine
# Maxine: What
# Denaun: You thinking about sucking my dick?
# Maxine: Yeah for a small price
# Denaun: For a small price? What you mean?
# Maxine: You know, money nigga
# Denaun: You don't need no damn money,
# I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.
# Maxine: (laughing) What you, what you hear I got?
# Denaun: AIDS
# Maxine: (laughing) Who told you that bullshit?
# Denaun: My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
# Maxine: Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then
# Denaun: Oh for real, it's like that?
# Maxine: (laughing) Well I ain't got shit,
# so he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me,
# I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga
# Denaun: Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you
# Maxine: No, see..
# Denaun: You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
# Maxine: Hold on, why it ain't even like that
# Denaun: I want ya'll to get paid, fucking..

# In the pit of my stomach, it feels shallow
# My heart beats faster
# My body becomes weak
# My arms shake
# My fingers feel icy
# My lips are dry
# My eyes are holding back tears
# My head is tingling
# My toes curl
# My knees shake
# My body feels pale
# and I can barely breath
# I'm begining to think its called love
# Its such a wonderful feeling, but its always followed by pain.
# I feel this for you garion, and you'll never feel this for me.
# In fact, you pretty much hate me.
# I don't know how to live with that.
# I don't even know how to talk to you.
# Would you like me to just pretend I don't know you?
# Perhaps it would make you happy
# I shouldn't have to try, if you hate me, you hate me.
# Theres nothing I can do.
# I'm helpless and alone
> Eminem
# Yeah
# I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
# But hey, what daddy always tell you?
# Straighten up little soldier
# Stiffen up that upper lip
# What you crying about?
# You got me
# Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
# Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
# I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
# I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
# Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
# Daddy's with you in your prayers
# No more crying, wipe them tears
# Daddy's here, no more nightmares
# We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
# Laney uncles crazy, ain't he?
# Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
# We're all we got in this world
# When it spins, when it swirls
# When it whirls, when it twirls
# Two little beautiful girls
# Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
# I know it's confusing you
# Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
# I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
# The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
# All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
# Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
# We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
# But things have gotten so bad between us
# I don't see us ever being together ever again
# Like we used to be when we was teenagers
# But then of course everything always happens for a reason
# I guess it was never meant to be
# But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
# But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
# Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
# [Chorus]
# Now hush little baby, don't you cry
# Everything's gonna be alright
# Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
# Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
# I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
# We feel how we feel inside
# It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
# But I promise momma's gon' be alright
# It's funny
# I remember back one year when daddy had no money
# Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
# And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
# Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
# I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
# Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
# But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
# And at the time every house that we lived in
# Either kept getting broken into and robbed
# Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
# Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
# Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
# And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
# And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
# Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
# On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
# And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
# And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
# And flew you and momma out to see me
# But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
# Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
# And you and Laney were to young to understand it
# Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
# And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
# I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
# Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
# Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
# Lookin' at  your baby pictures, it just trips me out
# To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
# Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
# Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
# I like the sound of that, yeah
# It's got a ring to it don't it?
# Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
# [Chorus]
# And if you ask me too
# Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
# I'mma give you the world
# I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
# I'mma sing for you
# I'll do anything for you to see you smile
# And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
# I'mma break that birdies neck
# I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
# And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (haha)

# Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
# I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
# I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer

# My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
# I have a disease and they don't know what to call it

# I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman

# So when you see me on your block with two glocks

# I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
# Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
# tellin your boys that I'm on crack

# Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
# Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion
# Pathological liar, blowin shit out of proportion

# Half animal, half man
# Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
# With more holes than an Afghan

# Verse Three: Eminem
# Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
# I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
# I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin
# Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
# Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
# I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher
# I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
# Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes
# In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush
# Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
# Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
# Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
# Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
# Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
# I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median
# Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

# One nation under God
# Indivisible with liberty and justice for all...
# It feels so good to be back..
# I scrutinize every word, memorize every line
# I spit it once, refuel, re-energize and rewind
# I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
# I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
# It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
# I say to fight, you take it as I'mma whip someone's ass
# If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
# A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
# Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
# Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
# And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
# Slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts
# Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
# Of his career typical manure moving past that
# Mr. kisses ass crack, he's a class act
# Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back

# Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
# As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
# Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
# Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
# Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
# To the light at the end of the tunnel
# We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
# Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
# Take us right through the doors (c'mon)
# All the people up top on the side and the middle
# Come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little
# Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
# All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
# Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together
# To celebrate for the same cause don't matter the weather
# If it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better
# They ain't gonna stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever
# They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go
# Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know
# Stomp, push, shove, mush, Fuck Bush, until they bring our troops home (c'mon)

# Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us
# Mosh pits outside the oval office
# Someone's tryina tell us something,

# For this monster, this coward,
# That we have empowered
# This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
# How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
# Now this is our final hour
# Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice
# Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
# Try to amplify the times it, and multiply by six...
# Teen million people, Are equal at this high pitch
# Maybe we can reach alqueda through my speech
# Let the president answer a higher anarchy
# Strap him with an Ak-47, let him go, fight his own war
# Let him impress daddy that way
# No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
# No more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal
# If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero
# Look in his eyes its all lies
# The stars and stripes, they've been swiped, washed out and wiped
# And replaced with his own face, Mosh now or die
# If I get sniped tonight you know why,
# Cause I told you to fight.
# [Chorus]
# And as we proceed,
# To Mosh through this desert storm,
# In these closing statements, if they should argue
# Let us beg to differ
# As we set aside our differences
# And assemble our own army
# To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction
# That we call our President, for the present
# And Mosh for the future of our next generation
# To speak and be heard

# So much for first single on this one
# [Verse 1]
# Shady's the lable
# Aftermath is the stable
# That the horses come out erra
# Of course we're about to stir up
# Some shit thick as ms. buttersworth's syrup
# It's the mr. picked on Christopher Reeves
# Just for no reason other than the just to tease him
# Cause he was as big as He used to be Superman
# Now we're pourin liquor on the curb in his name for him
# Eminem you wait till' we meet up again
# Fucker I'm kickin your ass for everything you've ever said
# It's one for the money two for the fuckin show
# Ready get set, let's go
# Here comes the buckin broncos stompin and stampedin up the damn street
# Like them buffalo soldiers, I told ya I'm bout' to blow
# So look out below, geronimo, motherfuckers is dominos
# I'm on a roll, around and around I go
# When will I stop I don't know
# Tryna pick up where the Eminem Show left off
# But I know anything's possible
# Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
# I'm at the top of my game
# That shit is not gonna change
# Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team
# I'll get away with murder
# I'm like OJ, he's like my Cochran today
# We keep the Mark Fuhurman tapes
# In a safe, locked them away
# Better watch what you say
# Just when you thought you were safe
# Them fuckers got you on tape
# You swear to God you was playin
# Whether or not you was little Joshua
# Gosh I wish I coulda told you to not do the same
# Cause one day it could cost you your name

# Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
# Do you have a daddy?
# I'll bet you do
# *Door opens*
# who's your daddy?
# Hailie:
# Daddy, what're you doing?
# Beat starts
# Eminem:
# Haha
# Eminem & Hailie:
# Ok then! everybody, listen up!
# Eminem:
# I'm goin to hell, who's comin' with me?
# Hailie:
# Somebody, please help him!
# *giggle*
# i think my dad gone crazy!
# Verse #1:
# There's no mountain i can't climb
# There's no tower too high,
# No plane that i can't learn how to fly
# What do i gotta do to get through to you, show you
# There ain't nothing i can't take this chainsaw to
# *Hailey Makes Chainsaw Sound*
# Fuckin' brains brawn, and brass balls
# I cut 'em off, then got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
# Inside of a hall, with my framed autograph,
# Sunglasses with elton john's name, on my drag wall
# I'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off
# All this time, me and dre been fucking with hats off
# Dr Dre:
# Suck it marshall
# Eminem:
# Tell laura and her husband to back off
# Before i push this motherfucking button and blast off
# And launch one of these russians, and that's all
# *Hailie Makes Explosion Sound*
# Blow every fucking thing, except afghanistan on the map, off
# We wanna stop, we wanna knock the crap off
# *Knocking*
# Haley, tell 'em baby
# Haley:
# My dad's lost it
# Chorus:
# Eminem:
# There's really nothin' else to say ha, i can't explain it
# Hailie:
# I think my dad gone crazy!
# Eminem:
# A little help from hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe
# Hailie:
# I think my dad gone crazy!
# Eminem:
# Theres nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
# Hailie:
# I think my dad gone crazy!
# Eminem:
# There's noone on earth that can save me, not even halie
# Hailie:
# I think my dad gone crazy!
# Verse 2:
# It's like my mother always told me
# *Eminem Impersinates His Mom*
# Rnrnrnrnrnrrrr, n codeine n goddamit, you little motherfucker
# If you aint got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
# Er..
# Fuck that shit, bitch, eat a motherfuckin' dick
# Chew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
# I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
# I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
# And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose
# Then quit bringin my flos, quit giving me my ammo
# Can't you see why i'm so mean? if y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my M.O.
# I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
# Catch a homo by his toe, man i don't know no more
# Am i the only fuckin one who's normal any more?
# Hailey:
# Dad
# Chorus
# Verse #3:
# My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
# And at the same time, make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
# So what you're seeing is a genius at work
# Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first,
# Cuz when i speak, it's tongue in cheek
# I'd yank my fuckin teeth before id ever bite my tongue
# I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
# And die and come back as vanilla ice's son
# And walk around the rest of my life spit on
# And kicked and hit with shit, every time i sung
# Like r kelly as soon as bump n' grind comes on
# More pain inside o' my brain, in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane
# Aimed at the world trade, standin' on ronny's grave,
# Screaming at the sky, the clouds gather its clyde mathers and bonnie jade
# And that's pretty much the gist of it
# Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
# Nine millimeter, heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
# I don't blame you, i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither
# Chorus
# Outro:
# Eminem:

# [Nate Dogg]
# I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name
# Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
# Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
# Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
# Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
# Heard you so long, you be up to get the pain
# I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
# Right before you lay in your coffin, dont say my name

# Hi! My name is (what?)...my name is (who?)...
# my name is... Slim Shady
# Hi! My name is (huh?)...my name is (what?)...
# my name is... Slim Shady
# Ahem...excuse me!
# Can I have the attention of the class for one second...
# Hi kids! Do you like violence? (yeah yeah yeah!)
# Wanna see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (uh huh!)
# Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (yeah yeah!)
# Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (huh?)
# My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
# But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Ummmm..)
# Dr. Dre said: "Slim Shady you a basehead."
# Uh-uhhh! "Then why's ya face red, man you wasted"
# Well since age 12 I've felt like I'm someone else
# Cuz I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
# Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
# And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
# I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
# Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
# C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
# I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off
# Hi! My name is (what?)...my name is (who?)...

# My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high
# Only problem was, my English teacher was a guy
# I smacked him in his face with an eraser
# Chased him with a stapler
# And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Owwwwwwww!)
# Walked in a strip club, had my jacket zipped up
# Flashed the bartender and stuck my dick in the tip cup (Wsssshhhhh...)
# Extraterrestrial, kill'n pedestrians
# Rap'n lesbians while they're screamin' "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!"
# 99% of my life I was lied to
# I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
# I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
# Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
# You know you blew up when the women rush the stands
# To try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Aaahhhhhh!)
# This guy's wife passed so asked for my autograph
# So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE!
# Hi! My name is (what?)...my name is (who?)...

# Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
# Dr. Dre don't just stand there, OPERATE!
# I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
# I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
# Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide,
# I just drank a fifth of vodka...dare me to drive? (Go 'head.)
# All my life I was very deprived
# I ain't had a woman in years, my palms are too hairy to hide
# Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
# I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere.)
# When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
# HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM? YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS!
# I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
# Put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (BANG!)
# I'm steamin' mad (Arrrggghhh!)

# My Natural Habitat;
# Aiyo this is me in my natural habitat
# Am I underground, or am I just a spoiled brat
# I drink a litre of tylenol
# Petrol is what runs my role, no ethanol
# Fuckit
# Giving it a 110% but luckily I ain’t gotta pay the rent
# School goes on
# Switching your mind thoughts on
# English German they’re all the same
# Gotta do homework everyday but hey
# It’s ok cuz in your life it clears a way which you can take
# Without having to fake a diploma
# And end up in a coma
# Cuz you couldn’t pay the dealer…nothing can get realer
# Cheaper, unless you become a keeper for some ice-hockey team in the NHL
# Cuz that will tell you that everything will get well
# That you won’t need to sell your wife to get away from the knife
# I remember when I was younger and funner
# But I was no good runner, I could scream like thunder, my neighbour was a hunter
# Hunting, blunting, that’s a fun thing
# yeh really it is
# Aiyo this is me in my natural habitat
# Shoot your grandma cuz she looks like a cat
# I drink a litre of tylenol
# Petrol is what runs my role, no ethanol
# Fuckit
# Bling bling, I’m tired of everything
# Ding dong I sing a song for this chick wearing a thong
# I wanna stay alive, I wanna survive and I wanna perform live
# I need time
# To heal cuz there’s no chance that I will kneel down like a clown and frown
# It’s time to cheer, not shed a tear but I fear that death is coming near
# I can hear it from the rear, I can see it clear
# I got support from my friends
# But everything tends to send me to court
# I lock myself in my fort it’s the kinda sort that send me a package of Blends
# To my porch lighting a torch to see the world I envy
# Everything can be nothing to see this is me
# Aiyo this is me in my natural habitat
# Shoot your grandma cuz she looks like a cat
# I drink a litre of tylenol
# Petrol is what runs my role, no ethanol
# Fuckit
# I will tell you about what runs my life
# It’s the hate, and the rate of thoughts
# Living on tequila shots and cuttin myself wit knives
# My brain dives into a nothingness
# A bottomless hole
# Filled with pain and sorrow
# No time to borrow a rhyme to make things aight
# Cuz it’s pointless
# Timeless
# I’m tired of this
# I wanna be famous
# And entertainous
# All I see is pain
# And all I feel is rain
# Hitting my overheated brain
# This is insane
# How can one person make you feel like this
# Make you just wanna diss
# And give another one a fake kiss
# I approve with this wrist
# And remove my foolish pulse
# That beats for nothing
# At least now you’ll have something
# To think about
# This will be the last time you hurt me, cuz I hurt myself
# Then I shout
# Fall to the ground
# Now things will turn around
# Will I maybe be happy now
# I bow to thee
# The mistress of depressed horror
# I’m infested, not the least bit interested
# In life
# This is what will happen now
# I will pull out this mag
# And aim it toward my head
# I will say that you’re a fag
# Then I’m dead
# Will anyone miss me
# Or is the world so full with greed
# That people try to keep what I twirled
# Aiyo this is me in my natural habitat
# Am I underground, or am I just a spoiled brat
# I drink a litre of tylenol
# Petrol is what runs my role, no ethanol
# Fuckit
# Natural Habitat continues until music fades

# There's not much you could do or say to phase me,
# People think I'm a little bit crazy I get it from all angles
# Even occasionally Doc Dre-zy
# Will have to step in every once and while to save me
# To make me stop and think about it fore' I just say things
# Sometimes I forgot what other people just may think
# A lota rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
# If they heard some shit I lay to tape before they erase me
# I may be a little too fast paced and racy
# Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me 20 times
# Cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
# Like I'm going too fast cause my mind is racing
# And I could give a fuck what category you place me
# As long as when I'm pushin' up daisie and gone
# As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
# When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
# For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
# I'm thankful for the talent in which god gave me
# And I'm thankful for the enviroment that he placed me
# Believe it or not I thank my mom for how she raised me
# In that neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
# It only made me what I am today see
# Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
# You ain't gonna' make or break me
# Tryin' to strip me of my credibility and make me look fake G
# You're only gonna' be in for a rude awakening
# Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna' face me
# And when you face me with all that shit you've been saving to say to me
# You had all this time to think about it now don't pussy out and try to about face me
# Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day that we finally meet in the same place to see

# My flow's untouchable now you gotta' face it
# Uh oh it gets worse when I go back to the basics
# You gon' say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
# The smell of victory, Love it so much I can taste it
# I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit,
# Graze it, your face talk save it, your shit sounds dated
# You're overrated I'm obligated to
# Study your moves then crush you muthafukas
# If I'm the best and the worst then God's gift is curse
# Soldier trained to destroy you payin' attention boy?
# I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss shit to be specific I go ballistic its heroglyphic
# My music is a drug press play, you ain't gonna sniff it
# Shoot it or pop it, roll it, bag it or chop it
# It'll get you high over and over but you gotta' cop it
# When it's hot, it's hot you're hatin' son and now I'm gon' stop it

# There's not much you could do or say to phase me
# People think I'm a little bit crazy
# I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Drezy'll
# have to step in every once in a while to save me
# To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
# Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
# A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
# If they heard some shit I layed to tape 'fore they erase me
# I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
# Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
# twenty times cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
# like I'm going too fast cause my mind is racing
# And I could give a fuck what category you place me
# Long as when I'm pushin up daisies and gone
# As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
# When I the heavenly gates, I'd be cool beside Jay-Z
# For every single die-hard fan who embrace me
# I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
# And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
# Believe it or not, I thank my mom, far as she raised me
# in a neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
# It only made me, what I am today see
# Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
# You ain't gonna make or break me
# Tryin to strip me of my credibility or make me look fake G
# You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
# Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
# And when you face me with all the shit you've been savin
# to say to me, you had all this time to think about it
# Now don't pussy out, and try to about face me
# Cause I've been patiently waitin for the day
# that we finally meet, in the same place to see
# [Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg]
# No matter how many battles I been in and won
# No matter how many magazines on my nuts
# No matter how many MC's I eat up
# Ohhhh, it's never enough
# [50 Cent]
# My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it
# Uh-oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
# You gon', say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
# The smell of victory love it so much I can taste it
# I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit, graze it
# Your peace talk, save it, your shit sounds, dated
# You're over-rated, I'm obli-gated, to
# study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
# If I'm the best and the worst then God's gift is a curse
# Soldier trained to destroy, you payin attention boy?
# I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss shit
# To be specific I go ballistic it's hieroglyphic
# My music is a drug, press play you ain't gotta sniff it
# Shoot it or pop it, roll it bag it or chop it
# It get you high over and over but you gotta cop it
# When it's hot it's hot, your hatin is undeniable, stop it
> Eminem
# I never loved.. uh never loved like i love u(2x)
# OH,
# I don't think i've ever loved somebody the way i love u
# The words are unexplanable
# All i could say is i love u
# And u will always be in my heart.. (uh, huh uh)
# Its like that poem;(yea)
# "Roses are red, violets are blue
# But nothing is stronger than my love for u"
# ah, what do I do, uh. u say u love
# I love u too
# but if u do, whyd u go break my heart the way u did ?
# I never loved,
# I never somebody the way I love u
# I love uuuu

# You're cherry pie
# And oh you're, cake and ice cream
# Oh you're sugar and spice
# And everything nice
# You're the girl of my dreams!
# If you wanted to leave me and roam
# When you got back, I'd just say welcome home
# Cause honey ain't nothing, nothing

# When I get this drum off
# Yo Strech give me a break, let me catch my friggen breath
# And till` the death, bust rhymes till` there’s none left
# I’m wanted for theft and robbery
# And probably smack a bitch up in the lobby G
# Cause she don’t want none of me
# I’m the illest MC to ever hold a cordless on the planet earth and you’ll see
# That I’m from the friggen D
# Ya’ll don’t get my point I’m from Detroit
# Smoking fake grass like a joint
# That’s the first simplest rhyme I ever said in my life
# But, at the end of the night I’ll still be fucking your wife
# Shit, I really don’t care your style needs to switch
# Cause you ain’t rich, that’s why you ain’t rich
# Remain underground, can’t come off the top
# You can’t drop rhymes nonstop like this
# I might twist my friggen dick up in your ear
# Rappers always wanna stand clear
# I’m a motherfucking landmine
# Ya’ll don’t understand mine
# I’m Slim Shady showing out like my tan line
# Ha, ha
# The illest MC to rhyme
# Every time the illest MC of our time
# I rhyme time and time twice but I’m nice
# With this mic device I slice right through your Adams apple
# I had a Snapple and a motherfriggen syringe
# Up in the bathroom I shouldn’t have but yo I boinked
# To any MC up in this shit who want some
# To any MC who wanna step up and get some
# Get done, fuck competition
# Let me catch my breath one more time
# Yo, I’m on a mission

# No matter what people say
# I'm gon' keep rapping this way
# No matter what you may think
# I'm gon' keep doing my thing
# One of the worst things
# Is fat, bald men decided to write songs
# And teach Mouseketeers to sing
# I'll stick Britney Spears in a room full of mirrors
# So she gets fifty years of bad luck
# Causing terror to Christina Aguilera
# When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara
# (Bitch!)
# You aware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
# With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled up his pants

# Probably got a Fanatic waiting upstairs in the attic
# With an automatic calling me up there
# My man Stan with a gat in his hand
# Staking my house out in a damn tinted Sedan
# Pull your mouth out till you can't finish a damn
# Ham sandwich or your canned spinach or Spam
# You gotta sip through a straw

# Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall
# Hey ma maybe I'll give you a call
# SIKE! YOU FUCKING BITCH!
# Suck a dick and two balls
# I'm giving you all my shocking script
# Which is to piss a priest off with this

> Eminem
# (Part 1: Tupac)
# Sometimes its hard, to wake up in the morning
# Mind full of demons, I dont wanna hear 'em anymore
# Got me heartbroken, fine, So many babies screamin
# Cuz they seeing destruction before they see a human being
# So they start smokin weed, we'll never get our day
# Until we learn to pray, keep our families safe
# Cuz they all broken, why? Two ghetto birds die
# Before we learn to fly
# Somebody else can say im pokin guns, smokin weed
# Can all make the change so im told but i havent seen a change unfold
# I keep hopin, please! If you prefer to breath
# Communities in need, of people that we lead
# Keep your eyes open now, then only say I try
# Until the day I die, I promised to be wise
# With my heart open, greed, brings only misery
# A weight of tragedy, so I stay sucker free
# Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise
# Dont be afraid to try, too many of us die
# For the thought of hopen wise, my brothers speak wise
# They focus on the prize, till everybody dies
# (Part 2: Eminem)
# We could only learn to take, our anger and our hate
# Control our mental state, settle down and just set it straight
# Maybe we could learn to take, a second to pump the brakes
# But we said it, regret it later, and let it escalade
# Cuz by then its just too late, theres so much we can take
# Theres only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
# Till the point that he just breaks, snaps and thats all it takes
# You think that we was learnin from other rappers mistakes
# But we aint, his brain will go against
# With every artist comes an image he portrays
# And a picture that he paints
# But in the midst of all this anger and this gangs
# Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangsta
# And I aint hear no complaints
# But I know, that I will always continue to grow
# As long as I lead, and never follow noone else's shadow
# There will never be another me, and that I will guarantee
# Its that why I remain sucker free, to this day
# The game, will never be the same
# No matter how much fame or success they attain
# There will never be another me
# And no matter what they do, there will never be another you
# You can search but you'll never find
# You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds
# We will never die, we are forever alive
# When we continue going, one day at a time
# (Part 3: Outlawz #1)
# Dont get caught in the publicity, and caught in the hype
# Rappers are, regular people minus money and lights
# Searchin for, fortune and fame and super stardom
# All the jewelry, all the cars, who screws the hardest
# Now the Hip Hop Police's surveillance is watchin
# And the kids think beef is their only option
# Outlawz, poor and filthy, guilty as charged
# My memories they can die, my -Makaveli- lives on
# You think the industry is fun, and no pity with guns
# And when your money is up, thats when your enemies come
# So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap
# We needin a change, the drama remains
# (Part 4: Outlawz #2)
# I spend my whole life,(yeah) fightin myself
# That, I cant win, so I'm invitin some help
# And every now and then, I take rights on the left
# I'm still just like a kid, lookin for stripes on my belt
# That day is a fight in itself
# So I just pray and hope God take a light to myself
# No matter how much I try to stay alive, I'mma die, mad
# Still standin and in love with my pride
# (Part 5: Outlawz #3)
# My hard frivilous beef, we passed that
# Im tryna keep some in c-comin and then collect on my ass cap
# But rappers in the game aint changed
# And I finally realized that we not in the same game
# The hatin will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it
# Them 4-5 a cop, chillers just I'm still with it
# Them streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
# Gotta stay lirry and keep your eyes on the Rollers
# They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
# So we gotta do it, we gotta do to keep growin
# One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
# When we continue growin, one day at a time (Damn!)

# Ya'll been here every weekend man,
# I don't ever get a chance to rap first man!
# That's cause you whack!
# What?!? I ain't whack nigga, I got some raps for all ya'll
# Nigga my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first,
# you can bust yours after me if you want to
# No no man, I'm going first,
# I'm getting tired of everybody wanted to go first man
# You always rap first,
# I'm rapping I don't care what none of ya'll say,
# I'm fresh, I'm fresh

# Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
# Point him out man I wanna know
# Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
# (scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
# I said who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
# Point him out bitch I wanna know
# Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
# (scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
# Verse 1: Eminem
# I'll have you taken back to Christ when you sacrifice
# The way you acting slice when I tear your back with knifes
# Jacking life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
# For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
# A stomped your man so unless you want what he got
# You better set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot
# I'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask
# If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
# It's an amazing task to battle with success
# I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
# And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians
# Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
# Wicked wizardry, like a sorcerer and no remorse for you
# When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
# So feel the force of my spiritual images
# Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
# My skin itches every time a rapper recites
# And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
# You wanna see fights I got a match for you
# You couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula
# Chorus: Thyme

# Verse 2: Eminem
# You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespecting me
# You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me
# Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
# Inferior, deterior rate, like bacteria
# Materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see
# How much in fear when u hear me you'll be
# Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
# Bite a rhyme and rip it off then stiffer and ache, whither and break
# You slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake
# I'll twist you into a different shape
# And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake
# If this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
# Every dis you can take, personal
# We ain't friends trying to make amends
# If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take a fence
# I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
# Your last releases, you bad diseases, that's the reason
# I'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic
# So pass it like a hot potato
# I've never been less than clever and fresh
# Severing flesh of fools who never impressed I can confess

# My teacher's two faced
# He went to lower all my school grades
# Cuz last thursday i had a tooth ache  from kool-aid
# So mom kicked me out
# [D]
# Get Out!!
# [E]
# All i had was my suitcase,
# A shoelace, a tube sock
# And a tube of toothpaste
# Sometimes it was cool
# Cuz i could go to a freinds
# Crash there, fool around and just skip school
# But other times I'd rather be home
# In my own room, Alone
# beatin my shit
# And nobody would know
# My little brother sucked on a bottle till he was six
# So I'd hide it inside the couch and say
# "I don't know where it is.."
# But as soon as mom found it
# I would either get grounded
# Or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks
# I'm still countin!
# Even when I was under age......
# Mom was tellin cops i was tryna run away......
# I told her "Some day bitch, you gonna pay...."
# Please mom please mom please I wanna stay....

# My brothers incoharent
# Moms a single parent
# Who ain't caring, Staring through me like I'm transparant
# Made it clear that i was just there to run her errands
# Told her friends that i was the son from her last marrage
# Sent me up to the corner store with a little note
# [D]
# Please sell my stepson ciggarettes so i can smoke.
# [E]
# One time i tried to fake a stich to get attention..
# Back fired and mom sent me to school with vengence
# My life is the worst thing that could ever have happened to me
# I go to class and every teachers always laughing at me
# Mom says "white rappers always get laughed at"
# Not only that, she heard me upstairs and i can't rap
# But I'm stupid
# I'll never make it average or a D+
# I need to sit on my ass
# And just sue people like she does
# One time I got food poisening from a hotdog
# Mom sued and got $2000 from Ballpark
# Hey mom you got a doller?
# [D]
# I don't Think so
# Now keep an eye on your brother,
# I'm Going to bingo
# [E]
# But mom you said.. you were broke
# [D]
# who said?
# You got your ears messed up (awwww)

# When I do pop pills I keep my tube socks filled.
# And pop the same shit that got 2Pac killed.
# Spit games to these hoes like a soap opera episode
# Then punch a bitch in the nose 'till the whole face explodes
# There's three things I hate: girls, women and bitches.
# I'm that viscious to walk up and dropkick midgets
# They call me "Boogie Night", a stalker that walks awkward
# Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
# Comin' through the airport, sluggigh, walkin' on crutches
# And hit a fuckin' pregnant bitch in the stomach with luggage
# It's like a dream I can't back out, I black out,
# I'm back out...lookin' for somebody up to beat the crap out
# I'm bringin' you rap singers two middle fingers
# Flip you off in France and translate it to english
# Then I'mon vanish from the face of this planet,
# Then come back speakin' so much spanish, Pun can't even understand it

# Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
# She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
# That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabana
# She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they wanna
# I spit a little G man, and my game got her
# A hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
# Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
# I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
# She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
# She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
# I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
# I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
# I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
# Bitch hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
# Look baby this is simple, you can't see
# You fucking with me, you fucking with a P-I-M-P
# [chorus]
# I'm bout my money you see, girl you can holla at me
# If you fucking with me, I'm a P-I-M-P

# Head full of hair, bitch I'm a P-I-M-P
# Come get money with me, if you curious to see
# how it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
# Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
# From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
# Girl we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
# We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all
# We could really splurge girl, and tear up the mall
# If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
# I'll be there to pick you up, if ever you should fall
# If you got problems, I can solve'em, they big or they small
# That other nigga you be with ain't bout shit
# I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch
# [chorus]
# I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
# I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
# I holla at a hoe til I got a bitch confused
# She got on Payless, me I got on gator shoes
# I'm shopping for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
# Man this hoe you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon keep her
# Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin know
# You saying it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
# Bitch choose with me, I'll have you stripping in the street
# Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
# Now Nik my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
# The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
# Get your hoe out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
# Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six
# Hoe make a pimp rich, I ain't paying bitch
# Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick

# One pound for the hoe, that's all we need baby
# Just one for the hoes.. c'mon
# [Chorus]
# Pimp juice - oooooooooh-ooooooooh-hoooooooo
# I think I need to let it loose (might think I need to let it loose)
# Let her loose, let her loooooose
# She only want me for my pimp juice (that's all she want me for f'real)
# Not my pimp juice, I'm talkin new pimp juice
# I think I need to cut her loose (it's time for homegirl to recognize)
# Yes I do, yes I doooooo-hoooo
# [Nelly]
# I'm in that, seventy-four, Coupe DeVille
# With the, power seats, leather, wood on my wheel
# One-touch sunroof BUT leave it alone
# Hoes see it can't believe it - "It's goin back on it's own"
# Oooooooooooooooh, shit, that's how we do it baby
# "Every day like this?"  Seven dayy-ayyys
# .. I tell you three-sixty-five
# Winter spring and fall, in the summer we ride
# You actin like you never seen it befo'
# Like them country boys ain't got no dough
# Bitch please - GET OUT - but don't you slam that do'
# DUST YOUR SHOES OFF - befo' you touch that flo'
# Cause you wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
# You really wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
# You're in a hurry - SLOW DOWN - and I might letcha touch it
# You ain't from Russia, so bitch why you Russian?
# [Chorus] w/ minor variations
# [Nelly]
# Now I'm - clean as a whistle (yeah) sharp as a razor (uh-huh)
# In anythang from Timberland to Gaines
# Now listen - I play the haters (ooh) like they should be played
# And uhh - I love the ladies (ooh) like they should get laid
# That's why I - I got my fade everybody had braids
# And now they - switch to fades and I'm thinkin 'bout braids
# Just an example of hoochieless jackin
# If we were hoopin, I'd be yellin "They hackin"
# I see you momma, in my Dolce Gabbana
# Gucci and Prada baby I gotta lotta
# The lucciana ain't a problem for poppa
# That's all you want then baby girl I'ma holla
# Cause you wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
# You really wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
# You're in a hurry - SLOW DOWN - I don't like how you actin
# Treat you like you're from Milwaukee, send you Green Bay Packin
# [Chorus] w/ minor variations
# (I think I just..
# need to take this time and explain to 'em exactly..
# what the pimp juice is)
# [Chorus]
# Uh, hear me out now
# Now your pimp juice is anything, attract the opposite sex
# It could be money, fame, or straight intellect
# It don't MATTER!  Bitches got the pimp juice too
# Come to think about it - dirty, they got more than we do
# They got mo' - juice in they talk, got mo' juice in they walk
# They got mo' - juice in they veins, OOH GOD DAMN!
# I tell you man it's a cryin shame..
# .. how people use, the juice in vein - you hear me mayne
# Pimp juice is color blind
# You find it work on all color creeds and kinds
# From ages 50 right down to 9
# The Mayor of Nellyville and I won't resign, watch me recline
# Cause you wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
# You really wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
# You're in a hurry - SLOW DOWN - bitch I got all night
# Matter fact, stand on my left boo - I know you ain't right

# When I was just a little baby boy,

# But then I got a little bit older and I realized,
# she was the crazy one.
# But there was nothin I could do or say to try to change her,
# cuz that's just the way she was.
# They said I can't rap about bein broke no more.
# They aint say I can't rap about coke no more.
# (AHHH!) Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
# till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
# (AHHH!) These motherfuckers are thinkin I'm playin
# Thinkin I'm sayin this shit cuz I'm thinkin it just to be sayin it
# (AHHH!) Put your hands down BITCH, I ain't gon' shoot you.
# I'ma pull +YOU+ to this bullet, and put it through you
# (AHHH!) Shut up slut, you're causin too much chaos
# Just bend over and take it slut, okay Ma?
# Oh, now he's rapin his own mother, abusing a whore,
# snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
# You goddamn right BITCH, and now it's too late,
# I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states.
# I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches

# I ain't acid rap, but I rap on acid
# Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added.
# WHOOPS! Is that a subliminal hint? NO!
# Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
# Eminem offend? NO! Eminem'll assault.
# And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
# to do it again, THEN, if he does it again
# you'll probably end up jumpin out of somethin up in the 10th
# (Ahhhhhhhh!) Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done, this ain't the chorus.
# I ain't even drugged you in the woods yet to paint the forest
# A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times

# Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
# Cause ladies screams keep creepin in Shady's dreams.
# And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
# these eighty G's a week to say the same things TWEECE!
# TWICE? Whatever, I hate these things
# Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
# Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
# just to argue with 'em cuz their ratings stink?
# FUCK THAT! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer,
# from fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her.
# From principal, to the student body, and counselor,

# just to hear you keep screamin for me to seep it.
# OKAY, I'M READY TO GO PLAY
# I GOT THE MACHETE FROM O.J.
# I'M READY TO MAKE EVERYONE'S THROATS ACHE!
# You faggots keep eggin me on till I have you at knifepoint,

# I sense someones tapping into my phones why do
# I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon
# The F.B.I might be tryin to pull my file soon
# I might be walking blind fold into a typhoon
# I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
# Right outside of the window of my living room
# And if they do you can say goodnight and bye bye to them itunes
# If I don't try to record as much before I do
# The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
# As I stand before you in this booth a walking deadman
# Blank stare dead pan look as my face as I gaze into space
# As I wait to be scooped up in that van
# Mysteriously disappear into thin air
# And they gon' say a sniper just appeared out of no where
# And I'll go down in the history as the blood sucking leech
# Who hid behind the freedom of speech
# Tryed to take the fifth amendment use it, twist it and bend it
# And ended up dying to fill out in the heros splinters (?)
# The business way to end this I can feel the tremors tremendous
# In remembrance of september 11
# Flash back to september 7th
# When Tupac was murdered in Vegas
# He said that he predicted his own death
# Let us never forget it or should we ever live to regret it
# Like the day John F Kennedy was assasinated in broad day
# By a craze lunatic with a gun
# Who just happened to work on the same block in a library book depository
# Where the President would go for a little friday stroll
# Shots fired from the grassy knoll
# But they don't know or do they?
# Whos they for them to say Touch
# Where all vunerable and it's spooky
# This is about as cookey as I've ever felt now
# Count down to Nuclear Meltdown
# 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
# You can run you can do what you want to
# But you know you aint gonna do nuttin
# When its time its your time
# You are the prime target
# You have become Public Enemy Number 1

# You don't know how sick you make me
# You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
# Every time I think of you, I puke
# You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
# You may not think you do, but you do
# Every time I think of you I puke
# I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
# But off of the dome would probably be a little more, more suitable for this type of song--whoa
# I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
# Sixteen bars, this ain't enough to put some ink ta
# So fuck it, I'ma start right here I'll just be brief I'm
# Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
# I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo of you
# On my arm, but what do I go and do
# I go and get another one, now I got two
# Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
# Now I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin
# I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
# My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim
# Shi-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-it
# If you only knew how much I hated you
# For every motherfuckin' thing you ever put us through
# Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you
# Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-who
# [Chorus]
# You don't know how sick you make me
# You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
# Every time I think of you, I puke
# You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
# You may not think you do, but you do
# Every time I think of you I puke
# I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
# But I thought a song would probably be a little better
# Instead of a letter
# That you'd probably just shred up--yeah
# I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
# How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta, a stupid piece a
# Paper, I'd rather let you see how
# Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle
# You're a fuckin' coke-head slut, I hope you fuckin' die
# I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
# I hate your fuckin' guts, you fuckin' slut, I hope you die
# Di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie
# But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
# It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
# It's just that when I think of you, it makes me wanna
# gag-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ag
# What else can I do, I haven't got a clue
# Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
# But every time I think of you now, I'll I wanna do
# Is pu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uke

# Like I'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you
# You better shut your fuckin mouth while you oh-for-two
# Back in ninety-four Limp opened the show for you
# Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
# Took your motherfuckin DJ and stole him too
# So you fall in a slump and get all emotional
# So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
# Confused as fuck cause now your
# music
# sucks dick
# Mr. Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap
# quicker but never last, and Everlast is a..
# [Chorus]
# Aight listen (look)
# So this is what we ask of our fans
# If you ever see Everlast, WHOOP HIS ASS
# Hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him
# Kick him, spit on him, treat him like a hoe, bitch-slap him
# Do it for me, do it for Fred, do it for Limp
# Do it for Rock, do it for rap, do it for Kid
# Do it for Ice-T, do it just to do it, fuck it
# He's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin!
# Shit in five years we'll all be "Eating at Whitey's"
# And he'll be bussin tables in that bitch, cleanin the toilets
# Aiyyo.. fuck this, cut this shit off
# {*music stops*}
# Aiyyo Head, that's why I fucked your mother you fat motherfucker!
# {*beat changes to 2Pac's "Hit 'Em Up"*}
# Kill Whitey! - Hahaha
# Kill Whitey! - Detroit!  What?  What?
# Kill Whitey! - .. yo, yo
# Kill Whitey! - Haha!  Look
# First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say
# Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay
# You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White
# So fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight
# Plus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip
# Whitey Ford, forty and white, lethargic ass dickhead
# I keep 'em comin while you runnin out of breath
# Steady duckin while I'm punchin at your chest, you need to rest
# Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya
# with your three CD's, nobody sees, when they released
# Evidence, don't fuck around with
# real
# MC's
# who ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks
# I let you faggots know it's on for life
# but Everlast might die tonight, haha
# Fat boy murdered on wax and killed
# Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know!
# [Chorus: Eminem]
# Grab 380's when you see Slim Shady
# Call the doctor to heal your heart
# They shocked you back to life at the clinic
# but you 'bout to get relapsed any minute
# Honkey, I hit 'em up!
# Hahaha, yo
# check
# this out
# You faggots ain't even on my level
# I'ma let D-12 ride on you bitch-made ass faggots!
# [Kon Artis]
# Yo!  Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
# Whitey Ford's heart just stopped
# Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack
# Whitey Ford's gettin his ass floored for talkin back
# Little faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are
# At your own restaraunt, while I'm servin ya
# Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops
# Call the cops, I'ma beat your ass while they watch
# [Kuniva]
# Ha ha, now we got the whole industry makin fun of you Erik
# Where's your House of Pain now?  There's only one of you Erik
# You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round
# with some killers from 7 Mile to the motherfuckin Belle Isle Bridge
# [Chorus]
# [Eminem]
# Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still
# this ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin killed
# with his chest open
# Tryin to throw a fuckin punch, but you just chokin
# Havin a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
# cause you SUCK motherfucker you should learn to rhyme
# Talkin 'bout you packin pistols but it's funny to me
# You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
# I'm a paleface killer whale
# on his way to fuckin prison, pistol whippin tail, ha
# Erik remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?
# That shit was obvious you probably was gay, ha
# Now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop
# Forty-nine thousand copies, the week your shit drop
# while my

# makin records break
# Two and a half million scanned by the second week
# Motherfucker I hit 'em up!
# [Proof]
# I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave., where bullets tear you in half
# Fuck the music, we got an uzi for all you fags
# Get the shit out of our stereo, Dilated you violated
# Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you
# Iriscience get choked up and yoked up
# All you underground bitches get your throats cut
# [Swifty]
# What the fuck?!  Is you stupid?
# I choke Whitey Ford with his fuckin guitar cord
# and
# stuff
# him in cardboard, chopped up in a box
# with sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart
# D-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch
# Keep your restaraunt locked and block your door
# Cause we "Hit 'Em Up" like motherfuckin Tupac Shakur

# You a, "Black Jesus," heart attack seizures
# Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases
# White devil, washed up honkey
# Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country

# Yo, aiyyo cut this shit off

# Fuck him, that's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done, that's it

# May I have your attention please,
# may I have your attention please,
# will the real slim shady please stand up,
# I repeat will the real slim shady please stand up
# .....we're gonna have a problem here.........
# (Verse 1)
# Ya'll act like you never seen a white person before
# jaws all on the floor
# like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
# and started whoopin her ass worse than before
# they first were divorced
# throwing her over furniture (aaaaaaah)
# It's the return of the...
# "awww..wait, no way, you're kidding,
# he didn't just say what I think he did,
# did he?"
# and Dr. Dre said...
# nothing you idiots, Dr Dre's dead
# he's locked in my basement
# feminist women love eminem
# chicka chicka chicka slim shady,
# "I'm sick of him, look it him
# walkin around, grabbin his you know what
# flippin' the you know who"
# "yeah, but he's so cute though"
# yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
# but no worse than what's goin on in your parents bedroom
# cuz sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose
# but can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
# My bum is  on your lips, My bum is  on your lips
# and if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
# and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
# and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
# of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
# by the time they hit 4th grade
# they got the discovery channel, dont they?
# we ain't nothing but mammals
# well, some of us cannibals
# who cut other people open like cantelopes
# but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
# then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope (eww)
# but if you feel like I feel, I got the antedote
# women wave your pantehose, sing the chorus and it goes........
# (Chorus)x2
# I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
# all you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
# so wont the real Slim Shady please stand up,
# please stand up, please stand up
# (Verse 2)
# Will Smith don't got to cuss in his raps to sell records
# well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
# you think I give a damn about a grammy
# half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
# "but slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird"
# why? so you guys can just lie to get me here
# so you can sit me here next to Britney Spears
# bullshit,Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs,
# so I can sit next to Carson Dailey and Fred Durst
# and hear em argue over who she gave head to first
# little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
# "yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee hee"
# I should download her audio on MP3
# and show the whole world how you gave eminem VD (aaaaaah)
# I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
# all you do is annoy me
# so I have been sent here to destroy you
# and there's a million of us just like me
# who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
# who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
# and just might be the next best thing, but not quite me......
# (Chorus)x2
# I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
# all you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
# so won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
# please stand up, please stand up
# (Verse 3)
# I'm like a head trip to listen to
# cause I'm only giving you things
# you joke about with your friends inside you livin' room
# the only difference is I got the balls to say it
# in front of ya'll and I don't gotta be false or sugar coated at all
# I just get on the mic and spit it
# and whether you like to admit it (riiip)
# I just shitted it better than 90% you rappers out can
# then you wonder how can
# kids eat up these albums like valiums
# it's funny,cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
# I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
# pinching nurses asses when I'm jackin off wit' Jergens (lotion)
# and I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
# and every single person there's a slim shady lurkin
# he could be workin at burger king, spittin on your onion rings
# or in the parking lot, circling, screamin I dont give a fuck
# with his windows down and his system up
# so will the real shady please stand up
# and put one of those fingers on each hand up
# and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
# and one more time, loud as you can, how's it go? ...........
# (Chorus)x4
# I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

# Ah yeah, yo!
# This song is dedicated to all the happy people
# All the happy people who have real nice lives
# And who have no idea whats it like to be broke as fuck
# Verse One:
# I feel like I'm walking a tight rope, without a circus net
# I'm popping perkasets, I'm a nervous wreck
# I deserve respect; but I work a sweat for this worthless check
# Bout to burst this tech, at somebody to reverse this debt
# Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
# Full of venom and rage
# Especially when I'm engaged
# And my daughter's down to her last diaper
# That's got my ass hyper
# I pray that god answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
# Watching ballers while they flossing in their pathfinders
# These overnight stars becoming autograph signers
# We'll all gone blow up and leave the past behind us
# Along with the small fry's and average half pinters
# While playa haters turn bitch like they have vaginas
# Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
# Money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
# Snakes slither in the grass spineless
# Chorus: repeat 2X
# That's Rock Bottom
# When this life makes you mad enough to kill
# That's Rock Bottom
# When you want something bad enough you'll steal
# That's Rock Bottom
# When you feel you have had it up to here
# Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
# Verse Two:
# My life is full of empty promises
# And broken dreams
# I'm hoping things will look up
# But there ain't no job openings
# I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
# Living in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
# And I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay
# And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
# But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play
# Cause when we die we know were all going the same way
# It's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
# When all you need is bucks to be the man
# Plus a luxury sedan
# Too comfortable and roomy in a six
# They threw me in the mix
# With all these gloomy lunatics
# Walk around depressed
# And smoke a pound of ses a day
# And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
# My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play
# Live half my life and throw the rest away
# Chorus
# There's people that love me and people that hate me
# But it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful, and shady
# I want the money, the women, the fortune, and the fame
# That Means I'll end up burning in hell scorching in flames
# That means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name
# Lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
# Right now I feel like just hit the rock bottom
# I got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em
# I'm screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot 'em
# Holding two glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em
# My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or sock's on 'em
# And them rings you wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em
# And while you flaunting them I could be taking them to shops to pawn them
# I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em?
# Cause I never went gold of one song
# I'm running up on someone's lawns with guns drawn

# Alright its my turn let me show you how I do shit
# Its nothin like you guys cause I recite poetry that knowone likes
# This is the night for all of us to flow to everyone and not for fun
# come on now Im on its real and Ima tell you how I feel
# Everyone of you punk mothafuckas see us as fake
# thats a big mistake cause when your fuckin with us we cant be stopped
# were on top poppin off right now whilin out
# fucking with us you will be dealt with your head cut off
# me and my crew arent soft you will be pissed and I also promise
# to leave you dismissed along with gettin your ass kicked
# were from the ROCK and where Im from you cant be seen
# All of you are the downfall and you dont have the balls to come at us
# Im NOTORIOUS like BIGGY and I love when fake niggas test me
# I came in this game with my pockets empty and left with a roll of 20's
# Theres a first time for every rhyme and every line this is mine
# My 1 YEAR bid in the bin it made me a man
# Doing this shit crazy while half of you amaze me
# If this is nonsense to you its because you aint been through
# You obviously aint been threw shit
# Age 16  started hating everyone and everything cause I relized that
# shit doesnt always go my way unless I got money that earns say
# While the consequences every year come with fear
# Cause around here you never know when death is near
# This shit is really how I feel doubt me and it makes me stronger
# I ts an adrenaline rush when I touch the dutch along with the mic
# Around here I am well liked so fuck all of you that think Im shit
# cause if there really is a real nigga Im it
# I aint gonna stop till I know me and my crew are on top
# of the charts and ahead of our rap game
# Maintain by gettin our words of stress
# Str8ght to all of your heads so you know we dont play
# I pray everyday to be like me cause I know Im ready
# to do this shit that I was not taught to do
# My mind is my eyes that lye me to be blind
# hoping to find my lyrics to make all of you fear this.

# OK, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
# You can try this at home
# You can be just like me!
# Mic check one two.. we recordin?
# I'm cancerous, so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this
# If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
# I strangled you to death then I choked you again
# Then break your fuckin legs till your bones poke through your skin
# You beef wit me, I'ma even the score equally
# Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat yer ass legally
# I get you blunted off of funny home grown
# Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
# (Ohh no!!)  So if I said I never did drugs
# That would mean I lie AND get fucked more than the President does
# Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
# I ripped her fuckin tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch!)
# My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
# Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads (Fuck you!)
# Every girl I ever went out wit is goin lez
# Follow me and do exactly what the song says:
# smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people and drink
# And jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
# I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
# So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
# Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin skill
# Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
# But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
# How the fuck can I be white, I don't even exist
# I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
# Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
# My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
# And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?
# Now follow me and do exactly what you see
# Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
# I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D.
# Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
# Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
# When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold'
# Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
# Killed em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco (we did it!)
# My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
# I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt
# I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
# That'll spray an Aerosol can up at the ozone layer (psssssssh)
# My rap style's warped, I'm runnin out the morgue
# witcha dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
# Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon wit a cape on
# And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
# I'm bout as normal as Norman Bates, with deformative traits
# A premature birth that was four minutes late
# Mother.. are you there?  I love you
# I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
# Will someone explain to my brain that I just severed
# a main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
# I take a breather and sighed; either I'm high, or I'm nuts
# Cause if you ain't tiltin this room, neither am I
# So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
# Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
# Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with
# I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it
# I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
# Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
# I've been with 10 women who got HIV
# Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
# I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
# Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
# I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
# You probably wanna grow up to be just like me!!!

# B/W Chorus:
# Hollywood
# Why do I Feel This Way
# Verse #1:
# I thought i had it all figured out i did'nt
# I thought i was tough enough to stick it out with kim
# But i wasnt tough enuff to juggle two things at once
# I found myself lying on my knees in cuffs
# Which shoulda been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
# How come i couldnt just see this shit myself its just me
# Nobody coulda seen this shit i felt
# Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when i fell
# To catch me the minute she was heated she just bailed
# Im standin and swingin on like 30 people by myself
# I couldnt even see the millimeter when it fell
# Turned around saw Gary stashin' a heater in his belt
# Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
# I just sold 2 million records i dont need to go to jail
# Im not about to lose my freedom over no female
# I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground
# So for now
# Chorus:
# Verse #2:
# Bury my face in comic books cuz i dont wanna look
# And nothing in this world is too much
# I swallowed all i could
# If I could swallow a bottle of tylenol i would
# And end it for good and say good bye to Hollywood
# I prolly should cuz these problems are piled all at once
# Cuz everything that bothers me i got all bottled up
# I think im bottoming out but im not about to give up
# I gotta get up, thank god i got a little girl
# Now I'm a responsible father's not alotta good
# I'd be to my daughter layin in the bottom of the mud
# Must be in my blood cuz i dont know how to do it
# All i know is that I dont want her following in the footsteps
# Of my dad cuz i hate him so bad
# The worst feeling i had was growing up to be like this fuckin ass
# Man if you could understand why I am the way that I am
# What do I say to my fans when I tell i'm
# Chorus:
# Verse #3:
# I dont wanna quit
# But shit, I feel like this is it
# For me to have this much i feel like this is it
# This is not a game this fame the real life is as sick
# Publicity stunt my ass, consume my fuckin dick
# Fuck the guns, im done ill never look at gats
# If i scrap, ill scrap like aint never woops some ass
# I love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact
# That I sacrificed everything I had
# I never dreamt i'd get to the level that im at
# This is wack, this is more then I ever coulda asked
# Everywhere I go I had a sweater, hood or mask
# What about math? how come I wasnt ever good at that
# Its like the boy in a bubble who never could adapt I'm trapped
# If I could go back, I never woulda rapped
# I sold my soul to the devil, ill never get it back
# I just wanna leave this game with  level head intact
# Imagine going from bein' a no one and seein everything blow up
# And all you did was grow up mceein'
# Its fuckin crazy, all I wanted was to give Hailie the life i never had
# I've forced us to live alienated, so i'm sayin:
# Chorus:

# I float like big spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
# Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
# I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby

# to do war, and try to bring my crew back down
# I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now

# Now was I, blessed with a gift, or cursed with a curse?

# I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name
# Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
# Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same

# I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
# Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name

# Why do you hate me? (Hate me) I came from nothin
# Blood sweat and tears, you did not create me
# How can you doubt me? (Doubt me) You don't know shit about me
# There'd be no West coast without me
# Cut with the bullshit (Bullshit) I struggle for survival
# And now you tryin to act like my rival?
# Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
# Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
# all the pain (all the pain) all the agony (all the agony)
# All the horror (all the horrow) all the tragedy (all the tragedy)
# Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
# I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
# Threaten my life? (C'mon!) One day you'll understand

# I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
# Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
# I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
# I coulda been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him
# purple, for mimickin him with two rappin Urkels
# I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
# But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
# I "Square Dance" cause I'm sick of rappin circles

# Well I'm witya homie
# [Dr. Dre]
# Okay, well let's handle the small shit
# [Eminem]
# I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
# Kick up dust, cuss til I slur up spit
# Grew up too quick went through too much knew to much shit
# Corrupt and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
# Thick n rich, sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth
# Dre tole me to milk this shit for what it's worth
# Till the cow just tilts and tips 'n stumbles to earth
# And if I fumble a verse, keep going
# First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
# No punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
# Fake shit if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit
# Wasn't for him? Wouldn't be shit
# [Dr. Dre]
# Creep with me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane
# Been here longer than anyone in the game
# And I ain't got to lie about my age
# [Eminem]
# But what about Jermaine?
# [Dr. Dre]
# Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin mine or Timbaland's name
# And don't think
# I don't read your little interviews and see what your sayin
# I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move till I'm provoked
# When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
# You midget, mini-me, with a buncha little mini-you's
# Runnin round your backyard swimmin pools
# Over 80 million records sold
# And I ain't have to do it with 10 or 11 year olds
# [Eminem]
# Cuz what you say is what you say
# Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
# Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
# So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?
# Cuz what you say is what you say
# Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
# Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
# So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?
# [Eminem]
# Second verse, it gets worst
# It gets no better than this
# Amatuers drink veteran piss
# From a dixie cup, if you ever mix me up
# Or confuse me with a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri
# Will rub it in, every club your in, we'll have you
# Black balled and make sure you never rap-a-fuckin-gain
# Dre ain't havin it as long as Im here, play devil's advocate
# [Dr. Dre]
# If there was some magic shit I could wave
# Over the indusrty that could save it when I'm gone
# And buried to make sure the tradition carries on
# I would
# [Eminem]
# If I could only use this power for good
# I wouldn't, not even if I could
# [Dr. Dre]
# From the hood and I'm a hornet
# And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
# [Eminem]
# And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warnin
# And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off
# Cuz I know, when they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
# Another punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk
# Don't give a fuck, white-pac, so much spunk
# When I was little I knew I would blow up
# And sell a mill or grow up to be Atilla
# Go nuts and be a killer
# [Dr. Dre]
# And I'm somethin of a phenom
# One puff of the chron
# I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
# There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
# So come along with us C'mon
# [Eminem]
# Cuz what you say is what you say
# Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
# Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
# So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?
# Cuz what you say is what you say
# Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
# Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
# So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?
# [Dr. Dre]
# Now anybody who knows Dre
# Knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin all day
# But I handle my business cuz it' work before play
# Don't look for trouble but I'll serve you gourmet
# However you want it, you could have it your way
# You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
# Bullet with your name, sendin it your way
# That goes for anyone who walks thru that doorway
# Cuz this is my space, you invade it
# Live to regret it and you die tryin to violate it
# Fuck around and you'll get annihilated
# Eyes dialated
# [Eminem]
# like my old lady
# Cuz what you say is what you say
# Sometimes what you mean is 2 different things
# Depending on your mood, if it swings, think too many things
# Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything
# Catch a contact, then I'm gone and I'm back
# I speed write and my loose-leaf's my lanch pad
# [Dr. Dre]
# And I can pull any string
# Don't have to prove anything
# Catch a contract on your head
# You headed West, talk shit about Dre?
# You better get a vest, then invest in something
# To protect your head and neck
# [Eminem]
# And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth
# I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
# But a lot of truth is said in jest
# And if I ever do live to be a legend
# I'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in the Source
# Ain't holdin' my fuckin breath
# But I suffocate for the respect
# Fore I breath to collect a fuckin check
# [Eminem]
# Cuz what you say is what you say
# Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
# Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
# So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?
# Cuz what you say is what you say
# Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
# Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
# So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?
# [Dr. Dre]
# Watch your fuckin' mouth

# Yo this Timbaland, tell him I said suck my d....

# These ideas are nightmares to white parents
# Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
# Like whatever they say has no bearing, it's so scary in a house that allows
# no swearing
# To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
# Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
# He's a problem child
# And what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about
# His fuckin' dad walkin' out
# Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
# If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
# His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
# Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
# He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
# His step-father hit him, so he socked him back, and broke his nose
# His house is a broken home, there's no control, he just let's his emotions
# go...
# Sing with me, sing for the year
# Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
# Sing with me now, just for today
# Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
# [Verse 2]
# Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's
# In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
# Holy or unholy, only have one homie
# Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
# Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a
# mothafucka they can be great
# Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
# It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
# Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
# Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
# From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
# To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
# But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
# Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
# To get they hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind
# every time you mad
# So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
# Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
# That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off

# But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so i'm signin' cd's while

# I repeat will the real slim shady please stand up
# we're gonna have a problem here
# (Verse 1 Eminem)
# Ya'll act like you never seen a white person before
# jaws all on the floor
# like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
# and started whoopin her ass worse than before
# they first were divorced
# throwing her over furniture (aaaaaah)
# It's the return of the...
# "awww..wait, no wait, you're kidding,
# he didn't just say what I think he did,
# did he?"
# and Dr. Dre said...
# nothing you idiots, Dr Dre's dead
# he's locked in my basement
# feminist women love eminem
# chicka chicka chicka slim shady,
# "I'm sick of him, look it him
# walkin around, grabbin his you know what
# flippin' to you know who"
# "yeah, but he's so cute though"
# yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
# but no worse than what's goin on in your parents bedroom (eheheheh)
# sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose
# but can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
# My bum is on your lips, My bum is on your lips
# and if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
# and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
# and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
# of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
# by the time they hit 4th grade
# they got the discovery channel, dont they?
# we ain't nothing but mammals
# well, some of us cannibals
# who cut other people open like antelopes
# but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
# then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
# but if you feel like I feel, I got the antedote
# women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes........
# (Chorus)
# I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
# all you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

# (Verse 2)
# Will Smith don't got to cuss in his raps to sell records
# well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
# you think I give a damn about a granny
# half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
# "but slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird"
# why? so you guys can just lie to get me here
# so you can sit me here next to Britney Spears
# bullshit,Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs,
# so I can sit next to Carson Daily and Fred Durst
# and hear em argue over who she gave head to first
# little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
# "yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee hee"
# I should download her audio on MP3
# and show the whole world how you gave eminem VD (aaaaaah)
# I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
# all you do is annoy me
# so I have been sent here to destroy you
# and there's a million of us just like me
# who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
# who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
# and just might be the next best thing, but not quite me......
# (Chorus)
# I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
# all you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

# all you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
# so wont the real Slim Shady please stand up,
# please stand up, please stand up
# (Verse 3)
# I'm like a head trip to listen to
# cause I'm only giving you things
# you joke about with your friends inside you livin' room
# the only difference is I got the balls to say it
# in front of ya'll and I don't gotta be false or sugar coated at all
# I just get on the mike and spit it
# and whether you like to admit it (riiip)
# I just shitted it better than 90% you rappers out there
# then you wonder how can
# kids eat up these albums like vaccums
# it's funny,cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
# I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
# pinching nurses asses while I'm jackin off with jergen's
# and I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
# in every single person there's a slim shady lurkin
# he could be workin at burger king, spittin on your onion rings
# or in the parking lot, circling, screamin I dont give a fuck
# with his windows down and his system up
# so will the real shady please stand up
# and put 1 of those fingers on each hand up
# and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
# and 1 more time, loud as you can, how does it go? ...........

# Verse N1
# Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
# Never was a gangster, until I graduated into one
# And got the rep of a villian, for weapon consealin'
# Took the image of a thug kept shit appealing
# Will it stick out my neck with respect if it meant life or death
# Never lived to regret what I said
# When your me, people just wanna see if its true
# If it's you, what your saying in your raps what you do
# So they feel, it's part of ya obligation of forefill
# If they see you on the streets face to face are you for real?
# The compitation ain't no compisation if you feel
# Your in violation, any hesitation? it'll get you killed
# If you feel it, kill it, you can conceal it, reveal it
# Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
# Pull it, squeeze it, 'til its empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
# I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

# These shoulders hold up so much
# They wont budge, I'll never fall or fold up

# I love pissing you off, it get's me off
# Like my lawyers, when the fucking judge lets me off
# All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
# I'll violate, and all the motherfucking bet's be off
# I'm a lit fuse, anything I do just gets news
# Pistol whipping mother fucker bouncer 6'2
# Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it
# You sweat bullets and excellent that method to get rid of the next bully
# It's actually better, cause instead of you murdering
# You can heard of me come back, and again I kick dirt in them
# Mr. pooring salt in your wounds, assault and get sued,
# You can smuggle lawsuits as soon as I walks in the room
# Everybody's hearts just stops, they call the cops
# All you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
# Running and ducking up at Hot Rock's parking lot
# You'll all get shot, whether its your fault or not
# Chorus
# Verse N3
# I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talking to em
# Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em
# I'm like a thug, with a little bit of 'Pac influence
# I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rocking to it
# You mother fuckers can never do it like I can do it
# Don't even try, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
# Don't ever run your life trying to knock the truse
# I spit the illest shit ever, could drive me to it
# So tic and toc, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
# Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock
# Listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen
# Mother fuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
# Full of controversy, until I retire my jearsey
# 'Til the fire inside dies and expires at 30
# And Lord have mercy on anymore of these rappers that verse me
# And put a curse on authorities, in the face of diversity

# and got the rep of a villian, for weapon concealin. took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin
# willin to stick out my neck, for respect if it meant life or death, never live to regret what i said
# when you're me, people just want to see, if its true if its you what you say in your raps, what you do
# so they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill, when they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
# in confrontation ain't no converstaion, if you feel you're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
# if you feel like it, kill it, if you conceal it, reveal it
# being reasonable will leave you full of bullets, pull it, squeeze it
# till its empty, tempt me, push me, pussies, i need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze
# Chorus
# I'm a soldier
# these shoulders hold up so much, they won't budge, i'll never fall or fold up
# I'm a soldier
# even if collar bones crush or crumble, i will never slip or stumbleI'm a soldier
# these shoulders hold up so much, they won't budge, i'll never fall or fold up
# I'm a soldier
# even if collar bones crush or crumble, i will never slip or stumble
# i love pissin you off, it gets me off, like my lawyers, when the fuckin judge lets me off
# all you motherfuckas gotta do is set me off, i'll violate all the motherfuckin bets be off
# i'm a lit fuse, anything i do bitch it's news, pistol whippin motherfuckin bouncers, six-two, who needs bullets?
# soon as i pull it, you sweat bullets, an excellent method to get rid of the next bully
# it's actually better cause instead you murdurin, you can hurt em and come back again and kick dirt at em
# it's like pourin salt into the wounds, assault and get sued,you can smell the lawsuits soon as i waltz in the room
# everybody halts and stops, call the cops, all you see is bitches comin out their halter tops
# runnin n duckin out to the Hot Rocks parking lot, you'll get all get shot whether its your fault or not, cause
# I'm a soldier
# these shoulders hold up so much, they won't budge, i'll never fall or fold up
# I'm a soldier
# even if collar bones crush or crumble, i will never slip or stumbleI'm a soldier
# these shoulders hold up so much, they won't budge, i'll never fall or fold up
# I'm a soldier
# even if collar bones crush or crumble, i will never stumble
# i spit it slow so these kids know im talkin to em, give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em
# im like a thu, with a little bit of Pac influence, i spew it, and look how i got you bitches rockin to it
# you mothafuckers could never do it like i could, don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
# don't ever in your life, try to knock out the truest, i spit the illest shit, ever been dropped to drop to two inch
# so ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock, listen to the sound of kim as she licks on a cock
# listen to the sound of me spillin my heart through this pen, mothafuckers know i'll never be Marshal again
# full of contraversy until i retire my jersey, till the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
# and Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me, and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity
# I'm a soldier
# these shoulders hold up so much, they won't budge, i'll never fall or fold up
# I'm a soldier
# even if collar bones crush or crumble, i will never slip or stumbleI'm a soldier
# these shoulders hold up so much, they won't budge, i'll never fall or fold up

# Sometimes
# Aight listen . Sometimes youve got to turn the beat up cuz its sick
# Listen  fuck it , just let me spit.
# Yow
# Here goes .
# Sometimes I feel like hurting the people who hurted me
# Or even murder them, see
# am a renegade ,revenge is what I need
# am not the type who smokes weed to impress
# I would smoke it cuz am depressed
# But I dont need drugs to make new friends
# Like all the rest of you fagots think
# Sometimes am starting to scrabble shit
# But just cant finish it of
# And when it looks ready am trying to spit it
# But keep forgetting the words
# Sometimes weve got to see the difference between
# Real life and music and whats on our mind
# Sometimes weve got to leave the misery behind
# And read between the lines
# Sometimes we even got to drive trough red lights
# And kill mics we might wanna answer some questions right
# Sometimes when am alone am starting to think
# Why do I even exist Ive got nothing to bring
# And in class am the weakest link and then am starting to sing
# But I want yall people to realize and starting to  see
# that somewhere deep down theres a decent human being in me
# sometimes when am alone I feel like quitting this life
# but then I realize that it aint right
# some shit reminds me of the dad I never had
# why do I keep running from what I needed so bad
# Sometimes I think lifes a game
# And everybodys a player who got
# Something to bring or something to say
# We got prayers, cops, waitresses even snobs
# Who stink in there jobs but still get paid a lot
# Sometimes lifes fucked up.
# Sometimes weve got to see the difference between
# Real life and music and whats on our mind
# Sometimes weve got to leave the misery behind
# And read between the lines
# Sometimes we even got to drive trough red lights
# And kill mics we might wanna answer some questions right

# Eminem: Lose Yourself
# 8 Mile Soundtrack
# Look, if you had one shot, and one opportunity
# To seize everything you ever wanted
# One moment
# Would you capture it or just let it slip?  Yo
# His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
# There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
# He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
# To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
# What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
# He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
# He's chokin how everybody's jokin now
# The clocks run out, time's up over  blough!
# Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
# Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
# He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
# He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
# It dont matter, he's dope
# He knows that, but he's broke
# He's so stacked that he knows
# When he goes back to this mobile home, thats when it's
# Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody

# [Eminem]
# If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say
# For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
# I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one
# Tryna pick myself up where I started from
# [Obie Trice]
# I never woulda thought that I'd see you outta control
# Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
# You should know between us we was like mates to soul
# Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes
# You was more so the chalant type, I chose
# To more shows, haunted you nights I suppose
# That's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows
# In the beginning, friends we decided to roll
# So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
# And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
# But bitches the gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
# We established this way before we became mates
# So whats required is that you chill with all that fire
# Get your desire when I retire
# [Chorus]
# Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
# I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
# Lord knows I was right cuz you just crossed the line
# Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
# [Eminem]
# I used to say I never met a girl like you before
# Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
# Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
# Till you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
# Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
# Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
# You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
# All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
# If you recall I used to treat you as a groupie broad
# When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
# But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
# It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
# You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
# And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
# And who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly
# Cupid could shoot another one of them God damn darts at me
# It's true that I got shot in the heart
# But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
# But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
# Till you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
# Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
# Before you make a decision that's life altering
# And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
# You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring
# [Chorus]
# [Stat Quo]
# In most cases, Stat's attitude is fuck-a-bitch
# My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
# But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
# Even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this
# Shorty on some whole 'notha other shit
# Tryna play sick thinkin' i'mma trick off rick
# I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
# Feed you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss
# We started off closer than close
# But who coulda predicted to know, your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth
# And the final result, back in that same boat
# I ask myself, do I love these hoes? NO!
# [50 cent]
# Em introduced us, "50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50"
# Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
# I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips
# With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
# We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
# Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
# Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline
# Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
# She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
# Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
# Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
# Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?

# I just tied her up, see I ain't like you.
# 'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more,

# Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I've just been busy.
# You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
# Look, I'm really flatterd you'd call your daughter that.
# And here's an autograph for your brother: I wrote it
# on the Starter cap.
# I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must have missed you.
# Don't think I did that shit intentionally, just to diss you.
# but what's this shit you said about you
# like to cut your wrists too?
# I say that shit just clownin' dog,
# c'mon, how fucked up is she?
# You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
# To help your ass from bouncin' off the
# walls when you get down some.
# And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
# That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other.
# I really think you and your girlfriend need each other.
# Or maybe you just need to treat her better.
# I hope you get to read this letter.
# I just hope it reaches you in time.
# Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'd be doin'

# If you'd relax a little. I'm glad that I inspire you, but Stan
# Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want
# you as a fan.
# I just don't want you to do some crazy shit.

# Chorus It will soon be Christmas Day
# Santas loading up the sleigh
# Hell come slide right down my chimney
# To give some gum an treats
# I love silvers bells, and Santas elves
# Its my favorite holiday
# They remind me that its Christmas time
# Its Christmas time
# Dear Santa.
# Hows it going? Yo its Stan. Whats up?
# I wanted to send you my letter earlier
# You know, to beat the Christmas rush.
# I know we already spoke when I saw you at the mall
# But I thought you might forget
# So just bring me what I wrote on this list,
# And well be all set.
# First off, I want a Sony Playstation 2
# And a bunch of games, I dont care which ones
# Ill leave that up to you.
# I want that Teenage Dirtbag CD by Weathus
# Some hilfiger jeans and a new pair of Adidas.
# Bring me a TV and a home computer.
# A fat leather jacket and a razor scooter
# I dont want no books I dont want no socks
# I dont want none of that stuff.
# I trust you Santa I know youll hook a brother up.
# Hey and listen: after delivering all those gifts
# I think youre ready to party
# So instead of cookies and milk
# Ima hook you up with a forty
# Well, I know you got a lot to do and a lot to plan
# So just beep me if you got any questions.
# Yo Im out. This is Stan.
# Chorus
# Dear Fat Man.
# You didnt bring me nothing I asked you to!
# I guess this is all some kind of sick joke to you.
# Does messing with me bring you some kind of joy?
# I asked you for a Playstation 2
# You brang me a gameboy!
# And whats up with this chemistry set that wasnt on the list g.
# And what in the world makes you think Id want Britney Spears CD?
# I think youve been in the cold to long it must have froze your brain.
# I specifically said no socks, I got 14 pairs, are you insane?
# And wheres my racer scooter, did you leave that on the shelf?
# JeezeLouise Santa. Do I have to do everything myself?
# You better bring me my stuff by New Year
# Or next year I wont leave you none of my daddys beer.
# Do we understand each other Santa?
# Good, thats what I thought.
# P. S.  Tell Mrs. Claus, I think she hot.
# Dear Stan.
# Dont threaten me you snot-nosed little punk.
# Theres a very good reason I left you all that whacked junk.
# I make two lists each year to separate everybody
# I got one list for the nice and one list for the naughty.
# In February this year you stole some cash from your mother
# In March you beat the crap out of your poor little brother.
# In April you skipped 3 days of school
# And in May you started smoking cause you thought it was cool.
# In June you stole a bicycle with no hesitation.
# July and August, hmm you where ok.
# What, you take a vacation?
# September my goodness, you made quite an impression.
# Burglary, assault, misdemeanor possession.
# So you see you little scumbag, theres a reason you got this.
# You were at the very top on my naughty boys list.
# So complain all you want about your lame Christmas gifts.
# You got what you deserved.
# P.S. Thanks for the Schlitz.  *burp*

# ...incredible thing I've ever heard
> Eminem
# Am I afraid of death?
# Hell yeah I'm afraid of death,
# I don't wanna die yet.
# A lot of people think that I worship the devil,
# that I do all types of retarded shit.
# Look, I can't change the way I think,
# I can't change the way I feel,
# but if I affended you, good
# 'cause I still don't give a fuck
# I sold it all for one joint
# Stoppin' the limo
# hop in the window
# shoppin' the demo at gun point.
# A lyricist without a clue
# what year is this?
# Fuck a needle, heres a sword
# body pierce with this.
# Livin' them up
# Never givin' a fuck
# Gimme the keys I'm drunk
# and I've never drivin' the truck.
# But I smoke dope in the cab
# I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
# Come back the next week and re-open the scab.
# A killer instinct runs in the blood
# Empty your four clips and bury your guns in the mud.
# I've calmed down now
# I was heavy once into drugs
# I could walk around straight for two months
# with a buzz.
# My brain's gone
# So worn my spirit is torn
# The rest of my body is still being operated on
# I'm duckin' the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
# 'cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time.
# Chorus*
# So all the weed that I've smoked,
# Yo this one's for you.
# To all the people I've affended,
# Ya fuck you too.
# To all the friends I use to have,
# I miss my past
# But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass.
# For all the drugs that I've done,
# Yo I'm still gonna do.
# To all the people I've affended,
# Ya fuck you too.
# Every time I reminist,
# Yo I miss my past.
# But I still don't give a fuck,
# You all can kiss my ass!
# I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
# Cut you so fast
# When your blood spilled it was still blue
# I'll hang you 'til you dangle
# And chain you at both ankles
# And pull you apart from both angles
# I wanna crush your skull
# 'til your brains leak out of your veins
# And bust open like broken water mains.
# So tell Sadam not to bother with making another bomb
# 'Cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm
# I got your girl in my arm
# and I'm armed with a fire arm
# so big my entire arm's a giant fire bomb
# Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
# and the pants that match
# here mama try 'em on
# I get amastertive
# with a mouth full of adjectives
# A brain full of adverbs
# And a box full of laxitives
# Proff of all school accidents
# God help me
# before I commit some irresponsible acts again
# chorus*
# I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
# I spent a million a track
# And went over my budget
# Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt
# I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet
# Drug sickness got me doin' some bug twitches
# I'm withdrawling from crack so bad my blood itches
# I don't rap to get the women
# Fuck bitches
# Gimme a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
# Never ran with a clique
# I'm a posse
# Kamikaze
# Strappin' the mother fuckin' bomb accross me
# From the second I was born
# my mama loved me
# I'm a cross between manson,each ominozzi
# I don't even know why the fuck I'm here in the first place.
# The worst day on this earth was my first birthday.
# Retarded
# What did that nurse say?
# Brain damage
# Fuck I was born dumb in the first place

# My heart was swimming in dog piss gathered by the wind.
# My voice bounced like your mom in a car crash
# into a pile of elephant shit.
# My lungs fell out, and stained your carpet
# in the cracked mirror.(ugly bitch!)
# Soft porn star,
# killed with a stream of  nipple discharge
# Danny hall is a tramp!
# If we could wank, nob in hand,
# I'd want to go
# to your toilet, (your bedroom), in your basement.
# I dream of being
# against your mom,
# my body in your nan
# disappearing into you.
# Words halted by the sound of breaking wind,
# a gentle illusion.
# A t-shirt torn by clowns is
# the price of a custard pie fight.
# My heart that had been in a surgical tray
# in a remote part of walsall.
# Those stars that hit me repeatedly in the pancreas.
# cannot hide my kidney stones.
# Isnt it time that you went to bed?
# If i could walk,if i had legs
# I'd want to go home
# to my moms kitchen.
# My dream of your grandad
# that I softly touch,
# farts in the teapot.

# We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture y'all
# Brought to you by the WOOOORRRLLLD FAMOUS Wake-Up Show!
# [RZA]
# Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
# Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
# Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you
# You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
# Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block
# One stopped, parks pops his truA FANCY A SHAG WEE BURNERS
# [Tech N9NE]
# When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
# Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
# Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin
# Look around, your town is crumblin
# This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin MC's lipless
# On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
# Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
# Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
# Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
# Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
# Sway & Tech heard me flow and its sealed
# Now I got Swedish women yelling "Tech N9NE's filled"
# [Eminem]
# This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out
# Cuz y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
# Climped out of a nice house,
# through the front window and heard this guy shout
# "Hey that's my couch, bitch!"
# Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
# While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
# And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible
# Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down
# You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
# I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
# And Sway & Tech, two disk jokeys
# Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject
# [Xzibit]
# Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
# Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
# Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
# Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
# Cuz your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
# Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake-Up
# The X-man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room
# Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon
# [Pharoahe Monch]
# Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
# From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assualts in small interims
# As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
# When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
# So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
# Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
# Why did he have to die like cast metal?
# O, huh, C now like Omar Credle
# We pone pedal at a high resolution
# On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution
# *DJ Revolution scratches*
# [Kool G Rap]
# I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway
# Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
# Who over debt to pay get swept away
# Across the whole board like checker play
# When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
# Wake-Up Show for those slept away
# Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
# DJ Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the heck-AK
# Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'
# Until the head of jake investigate
# [Jayo Felony]
# What? Sway can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
# Tech can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do?
# Rev can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
# I can give it to you, Wha Wha Wha What What!
# [Chino XL]
# Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
# Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
# Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
# What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
# The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
# For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
# Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
# Wit style filed for sexual harrassment like Tisha Camp-bell
# You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
# I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
# Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
# You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
# I'm Wake-Up Show reppin wit Sway & Tech
# My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
# I'm Chino X, bring KRS in
# [KRS-One]
# De de de de de de da di day, KRS-One comin wit the Tech & Sway
# Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
# As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
# Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
# You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
# But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
# They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
# Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway & Tech do
# I'll be back but for now just sackle!

# speak up your mumbling, what the fuck-a yousa bibi-bay okay big-bi-bi-baby
# this is Shady I know you was bi-bi-hoping we be-be-would just go away
# but weeble mable weeble wobble but we don't fall down like
# Jam Master Jay's two turn table, our lable is just too stable
# you're magazine so motherfucking thin you using staples
# to hold it together it's turning back into a news paper
# and yall got something for my ass every issue
# thank you, cause I keep running out of fucking tissues
# and I could diss you but god I was sick of looking at you
# at least now I can see when Nike's got a new tennis shoe
# but-but I guess no good news is always good good news
# moving on to bigger and better things (chicka chicka jeera)
# 50's blowing up, he should just keep showing up
# what the fuck is going on? who the fuck is Norah Jones?
# Shady wait a minute, baby, leave the whore alone
# Just go up there and be humble and take them awards home
# Bush has declared the world a fucking war zone

# woahhhh wait a minute I'm rambling, back to the matter at hand
# it's Green Latern with Elvis Presley the selfish MC
# back to the ruin rap and destroy the industry
# single handedly and oh man did we, yeah me and 50
# Obie, me and D Tweezy
# and Nelly and Missy and Jigga god damn it's all a plan divised by the man
# It's a conspriracy...against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits
# or ain't dope lyrically, so fuck what you hear and what you read about
# we ain't ruining rap baby we're just trying to weed it out
# Shady in the place to be see, and I got what it takes to rock the mic, aiight!
# still keep talking shit to me punk, cause your magazines over in less than 6 months!
# haha...Shady Records, still Aftermath
# and don't think we can hear you motherfuckers talking, cause we can't
# we don't hear yall
# so we're just gonna sit back for the rest of our lives while you ride our dicks
> Eminem
# And everyone should get along
# Okay children, quiet down, quiet down
# Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
# His name is Mr. Shady
# Chidren, quiet down please
# Bryan, don't throw that (shut up)
# Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with Pneumonia (he's got AIDS)
# Good luck Mr. Shady
# Hi there, little boys and girls (fuck you)
# Today we're going to learn how to poison squirrels
# But first I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (huh?)
# Say hi, Bob: Hi Bob
# Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
# He don't got a job cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
# But his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
# And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
# And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
# When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
# Drags them into the woods and goes straight to the chopping block
# And even if they escaped and they got the cops
# The ladies would all be just so afraid they'd drop the charge
# 'Til one night Mrs. Stacy went off the job
# When she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk
# But Stacy knew it was Bob and said knock it off
# But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker
# Crazy good as Slim Shady is off the block, uh
# You couldn't even take him to Dre's to give Bob a doctor
# Grabbed Stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
# And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
# But ever since the day Stacy went off the job they never found her
# And Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
# And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
# Doing what it might do to you
# So see if the squirrels warned you, it's bad for you
# See children, drugs are bad (come on)
# And if you don't believe me ask your dad (raise your hand)
# And if you don't believe him ask your mom (that's right)
# She'll tell you how she does them all the time (she will)
# So kids say no to drugs (that's right)
# So you don't act like everyone else does (uh huh)
# And there's really nothing else to say (sing along)
# Drugs are just bad, mmmkay?
# My penis is the size of a peanut
# Have you seen it?
# Fuck no you aint seen it
# It the size of a peanut (huh?)
# Speaking of peanuts
# You know what else is bad for squirrels?
# Esctasy, it's the worst drug in the world
# If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
# Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
# And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
# So don't get attatched to attack every bone in your back
# Meet Zach, 21 years old
# After hanging out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
# And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
# And peer presure will win every time you try to fight it
# Suddenly, he starts to convulse
# And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
# And his eyes roll back in his skull
# His back starts to look like the McDonalds arches
# He's on Donald's carpet
# Laying horizontal barfin'
# And everyone in the apartment starts laughing at him
# Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him
# And they took it too, so they think it's funny
# So they're laughing at basically nothing
# Except maybe wasting their money
# Meanwhile Zach's in a coma
# The action is over, and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicing yoga
# And that's the story of Zach and Ecstasy
# He's a maniac, so don't eat that, the squirrels say it's bad for you
# See children, drugs are bad (that's right)
# And if you don't believe me ask your dad (that's right)
# And if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can)
# She'll tell you how she does them all the time (she will)
# So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack)
# So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)
# And there's really nothing else to say (uh huh)
# Drugs are just bad, mmmkay?
# And last but not least
# One of the most humongous
# Problems among young people today is fungus
# It grows from cow manure
# They pick it out, wipe if off, bag it up
# And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
# Yum, yum
# And then you start to see some dumb stuff
# And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
# And sometimes you see things that aren't there (like what?)
# Like fat women in g-strings with orange hair
# Mr. Shady, what's a g-string?
# It's worn Clair, women stick them up their behinds go out and wear them
# And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
# Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus
# Your tounge gets
# All swollen up, like a cow's tongue (How come?)
# Cause it comes from a cow's dung
# See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
# But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at
# But don't be me
# Cause if you grow up and you're going OD
# They're gonna come for me, and I'm gonna have to grow a goatee
# And get a disquise and hide
# Cause it'll be my fault
# So don't drugs and do exactly as I tell you, they're bad for you
# See children, drugs are bad (uh huh)
# And if you don't believe me ask your dad (put that down)
# And if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can ask)
# She'll tell you how she does them all the time (and she will)
# So kids say no to drugs (say no)
# So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do)
# And there's really nothing else to say (that's right)
# Drugs are just bad, mmmkay?
# Come on children, clap along (shut up)
# Sing along children (shut up)
# Clap along
# Drugs are just bad (somebody's gonna sue me)
# Don't do drugs
# So there'll be more for me
# (Fuck that man)
# (god damn it, mushrooms killed Kenny!)

# My bum is  on your lips, My bum is  on your lips
# and if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
# and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
# and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

# by the time they hit 4th grade
# they got the discovery channel, dont they?
# we ain't nothing but mammals
# well, some of us cannibals

# at The Source was like, the only source of light
# When the mics used to mean somethin, a four was like
# you were the shit, now its like the least you get
# three and a half now just means you a peice of shit
# four and a half or five, means you Biggie, Jigga, Nas,
# or Benzino shit I don't eben think you realize
# you playin with motherfuckers lives, I done watched Dre
# get fucked on The Chronic, probably cuz I was on it
# Now you fucked me outta my mics twice I let it slide
# I said I wouldnt hold my fuckin breath to get a five
# Shit I was right, I'da fuckin died already tryin
# I swear to God I never lie I bet thats why
# you let that bitch give me that bullshit review
# I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit we knew
# You'd probly try to fuck us with Obie and 50 too

# Fuck a relationship we through
# No more Source with street credit, them days is dead
# Dre's got A-Ks to dave mase his head
# Every issue there's an eight page Made Men spread
# Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
# That I am not afraid, hes just a fuckin waste of lead
# on my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple
# So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed
# This old Gs bout to get smoked like rolled weed
# You don't know me or my motherfuckin mother you motherfuckin punk
# Put me on your fuckin cover just sell your little sell out mag
# I ain't mad I feel bad, heres an ad, heres a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad
# You wanna talk about some shit that you dont know about? ya
# Lets talk about how your puttin you own son out there
# And to try to eat off him, cuz you missed your boat
# Your never gonna float bitch you're just too old
# No wonder you're sore now, lordy ya board now
# I'm pushin thirty you kickin fourty's door down
# Bitch this is war now, and you'll never beat me
# all you do is cheat me out of quotables but you know
# that you'll always see me on your TV
# Cuz you gotta stay up till three in the mornin
# To see your video played once on BET
# So he-he-he who has the last laugh?
# Aftermath ya so on behalf on our whole staff
# kiss our ass-hole cracks we'll never fold or hold back
# Just know that Benzinos wack
# no matter how many times I say he's stan, hell never blow jack
# Your better off tryin to bring R-S-O back
# Look at your track record thats how far it goes back
# Its extortion and Ray owns a prportion
# so half of the staff up there is fresh outta jail from boston
# Bullyin and bossin, caged like a slave they've completely brainwashed him
# And forced him to stay locked in his own office afraid of the softest
# fakest, wannabe gangster in New York
# And its pitiful, cuz I never woulda said shit to you if you'd kept your mouth shut
# Bitch now what? hit it clue, spit it slay
# New shit, exclusive yo lantern, yo whoo kid
# You know what to do with this: use it
# I'm through, this is stupid, I cant believe I stooped to this
# bullshit to do this...
# And who you callin a bitch? Bitch. You owe me.

# It's time to reload this old .45 colt
# The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
# Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
# It's passed noon, he should be here soon
# Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
# All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
# Sounds like a thousand wolves
# I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
# I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
# I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
# but I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
# And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
# I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
# [Eminem]
# You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
# but I know you - the name's Slim - you want revenge?
# Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
# I'm tellin the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you..
# Chorus: {unknown singer}
# You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
# And life ain't fun, when you're on the run
# Got your gold and you got your gun
# But life as an outlaw just begun
# Got your shotgun by your side
# Got your horse and you got your pride
# You ride til there ain't no place to hide
# It's sad cause the bad guys always die
# [Dr. Dre] + (Eminem)
# He was "Shady," I seen by the look on his face
# He said take ten paces {shit} I took eight
# Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
# My {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
# (You need bullets, hurry up run!) {*imitating Slick Rick*}
# I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
# We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
# (Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want)
# I figured he was tellin the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
# So what we gon' do, it's on you
# (Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?)
# The Chronic!
# (Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two)
# (And plus I know who's got it)
# Who?
# (Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two)
# Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
# Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle
# We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
# An old ghost town that everybody forgot
# A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
# Slim grabbed the shotgun (Dre here's the plot)
# (Eminem)
# This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
# He's goin around sayin he took the game from us
# [Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin]
# But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
# He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
# Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
# Our mission - is to get him to stop layin eggs
# And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
# [Dr. Dre]
# I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
# Kicked the swingin doors in, started gun slinging
# I could hear somebody singin - it sounded like a "G Thang,"
# and a verse from "Keep Their Heads Ringin"
# I said "It's Dre's Day," and started to spray
# Against 1800, he pulls a AK
# Hollow tips started flyin every which way
# (Eminem)
# That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
# I fired the first shot, spun his body around
# He hit the ground and landed upside down
# Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
# I grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled
# Chorus 2X
# Always die..
# The Wild.. Gotham
# The Wild.. West {*BANG BANG, BANG*}
# Ha ha, riiiiide..

# Whatever..
# Dre, just let it run
# Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit

# Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
# Tryin' to roll up on Miami, leavin' with a broke neck
# Oh shit, leathal lyric equal land mind

# Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
# Cock-block your father's game
# I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
# So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
# And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
# I'ma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out

# As long as you feel’em.
# Till the day that I drop
# You’ll never say that I’m not killin’em.
# ‘Cause when I’m not, then I’ma stop pinnin’em
# And I am not hip hop, and I’m just not Eminem.
# Subliminal thoughts, when I’ma stop sendin’em
# Women are caught in webs
# Spin’em and hock venom
# Adrenaline shots of peniciline could not get illin’ to stop
# Amoxacilline’s just not real enough.
# The criminal cop killin’ hip hop villain a minimal swap
# To cop millions of Pac listeners.
# You’re coming with me, feel it or not
# You’re gonna fear it like I showed ya
# The spirit of God lives in us.
# You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
# Is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzin’ up?
# Fa shizzel my whistle, this is the plot listen up.
# You bizzels forgot, slizzel does not give a fuck.
# Till the roof comes off
# Till the lights go out
# Till my legs give out
# Can’t shut my mouth
# Till the smoke clears out
# And my high burns out
# I’ma rip these shit
# Till my bones collapse (x2)
# Music is like magic.
# There’s a certain feeling you get
# When you’re real, and you spit
# And people are feelin’ your shit.
# This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
# Trynna hold on to it, ‘cuz you may never get it again.
# So while you’re in it, trynna get as much shit as you can.
# And when your run is over, just admit when it’s in it’s end.
# ‘Cuz I’m at the end of my wits with half that gets in.
# I got a list, here’s the order of my list that it’s in.
# It goes Reggie, Jay Z, Tupac and Biggie
# Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurrupt, Nas and then me.
# But in this industry I’m the cause of a lotta envy.
# So when I’m not put in this list, the shit does not offend me.
# That’s why you see me walkin’round like nothing’s bothering me.
# Even though half you people got a fuckin’ problem with me.
# You hate it but you know respect you gotta give me.
# The press’s wet dream like Bobby and Whitney.
# Nate hit me…
# Till the roof comes off
# Till the lights go out
# Till my legs give out
# Can’t shut my mouth
# Till the smoke clears out
# And my high burns out
# I’ma rip these shit
# Till my bones collapse (x2)
# Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC’s heart.
# What is he thinking?
# How not to go against me, smart.
# And it’s absurd, how people hang on every word.
# I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve.
# But I’ll never be served, my spot is forever reserved.
# If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first.
# ‘Cuz in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
# That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse.
# My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict.
# I rap like I’m addicted to smack, like I’m Kim Mathers.
# But I don’t wanna go forth and back in constan battles.
# The fact is I woud rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
# So this is like a full blown attack, I’m launchin’ at them.
# The track is on some battleing rap, who wants some static.
# ‘Cuz I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim Matters.
# A plaque and platinum status is wack if I’m not the baddest, so…
# Till the roof comes off
# Till the lights go out
# Till my legs give out
# Can’t shut my mouth
# Till the smoke clears out
# And my high burns out
# I’ma rip these shit
# Till my bones collapse (x2)
# Until the roof, the roof comes off
# Until my legs, give out from underneath me.
# I, I will not fall.
# I will stand tall.

# Intro:
# Cause sometimes you just feel tired.
# You feel weak and when you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up.
# But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
# And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
# And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.

# Fred Durst: Check! Slim Shady, do the mic. kid
# (Eminem)
# I don't do black music
# I don't do Withe music
# I make fight music
# For High School kids
# I pull side full grips
# When I drive like this {screech}
# With a slipped disk
# From a Limp Bizkit diss
# I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
# So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
# Little rich kids in cribs
# Don't attempt this shit
# Just step back
# While I prep up to pimp this bitch
# So I said to the girl, I'm like
# "What up girl?"
# "Shut up girl!"
# And showed her a cut-up squirrel
# She screamed bloody murder so loud everybody heard her
# Slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
# I moved on to two blondes
# And kissed 'em on a futon
# {Ay yo baby!}
# {What do you want?!}
# I looked at 'em both and I was like
# "Look, check this out toots, I'm lookin' for cookie pus"
# I need to speak to 'em immediately
# They played my video on MTV last week
# And just when I was thinkin' I was all that and then some
# In comes Fred Durst
# (Fred Durst)
# Yo Shady let me get some
# Who knows what galaxy I came from
# One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
# Now I'm a nightmare
# You stay right there
# I got the diva
# Hold the flavor of a single
# See me and Shady?
# I think we got a lock down
# Shocked by the sound
# I got you cruisin' with your top down
# These two blondes
# I offered 'em both a drink
# And this you would think
# Could get the party started
# But instead them girls turned their heads
# Opened up their mouths
# Smelt like somebody farted
# So if it's time for me to move on
# Shady said the livin' room was a dance floor
# So turn me loose
# I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
# Bumped into this dude who was drunk
# And a prick
# Ramblin' on about how
# He was gonna kill me
# Wow!
# I spilled a drink on his shirt
# But no- He insisted we should go
# Before I could drop 'em
# Shady had to clock 'em
# The music stopped
# The party stood in shock
# So I looked around
# Grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf
# Turn me loose
# Turn me loose
# Turn me loose
# Turn me loose
# This party's goin' my way
# Or no way at all
# But don't you
# Turn me loose
# Turn me loose
# Turn me loose
# This party's goin' my way
# Or no way at all
# (Eminem)
# Turn me loose
# You better tell 'em to come re-shingle the roof
# Just keep feedin' me free drinks till I puke
# And Fred'll ask me to lead sing in his group
# I'm sick at the barn
# I'm not bein' approached
# Cuz Fred's over there stealin' all of my hoes
# {Yo Fred save me some}
# I walked up to these saimese twins
# And asked to have a threesome
# Told 'em two heads are better that one
# Plus I respect how y'all roll together as one
# Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
# Stood up like "Ay wait, where you goin" {bye!}
# Oh well
# Three strikes and I'm out
# I struck out and stood tied to the road {ouch}
# I ain't tryin' no more
# Fuck it- I'm chillin'
# Get a shot of yable {ahhh}

# Two Of You
# (Track 12 on "Rotator")
# Why tell me why
# There's a river to cry tonight
# Oh why
# Try don't you try
# You can never deny what's right
# Don't you try
# Look at me
# Caught
# In your mystery
# I'm giving twice the feeling
# And I'm not receiving
# Now my head is turning
# And my eyes are burning
# It's the truth I'm learning
# What am I to do
# With two of you
# Why tell me why
# There's a river to cry tonight
# Oh why
# Try don't you try
# You can never deny what's right
# Don't you try
# I can see
# You made a fool of me
# And you've been double dealing
# This is so revealing
# Which of you is Mary
# I can't tell it can't be
# You've both been deceiving
# What am I to do
# With two of you

# Slim mother fuckin shady....alright

# Verse 1:
# I'm homicidal, and suicidal, with no friends
# holdin a gun with no handles, just a barrel at both ends
# sprayin techs at you
# untill u see the fuckin legs full of bullets holes and the exit wounds layin next to you.
# fuckin mad dog, foamin out the mouth
# fuck mouth, my whole house is foamin out the couch
# jumped outta a 93 floor of a buildin
# and shot every window out on the way to the ground(keep filmin)
# woke up to a hospital staff
# got up and laughed
# chopped em in half

# Verse 2:
# yo, yo, im only smilin when im violent,
# got on the plane wylin,
# told the piolet to fly me to tylenol Island
# stewardess like "you restless?"
# "no bitch, im rest-Full, so hold this fuckin jet still so i can eat this pretzels"
# Forget school,
# the other kids are disrespectfull,
# they hold me down and play connect-the-dots with my freckles
# i can't take it
# i'm tryin to gain weight,
# so i eat steak
# and swallow the whole plate
# and weigh myself, naked
# without albulms

# Uhh, oooooooooooooh baby, baby
# Keep it thug, and keep yo' heat, na nah nah nah nah
# [Nas]
# Now slowly, thinkin of all the things that oppose me
# I think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me
# For they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid
# Dead in the street, it's so fuckin pitiful
# First they love you, could be the bitch that even live with you (hoe)
# Mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable
# Cause she wanna dress like Bonnie, Robin and Crystal do
# But Crystal's single, Bonnie's broke and her niggaz too (ha)
# I can do bad by myself; went from rags to wealth
# From Jags to Bentleys to, plenty ass bitches
# Can't keep they hands to theyself no more
# I'm like, Hugh Hefner, you lesser, you just a
# [Chorus]
# Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch
# You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down
# So you - wanna be me, you bitch, you phony
# You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only
# But you - wanna be me, you suckers, you weak
# You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day
# But you - wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson
# Concernin this mic profession, turn your direction
# [Nas]
# You can't be me, not in your wildest fantasy
# It's childish; should I have to resort to violence?
# Pay me a half a million, I'll consult your album
# And show you how to stay off my dick
# That's the thing I hate the most, can't even call you a man
# When you gotta call out my name to get you some fans
# No talent, you need direction; you a pussy with a yeast infection
# You unlucky, I'm your fuckin C-section
# Plus I'm the last real nigga alive
# Toast glass, Ill Will, the label get high
# Realize, how many classics I gave you
# Perhaps if you think back you'll realize that I made you
# [Chorus]
# [Nas]
# You can't be me, I'm tryin to walk a straight line
# Why they tryin to take mine? I'm past +8 Miles+ of every state line
# Eating, alligators and, hummingbird hearts
# At the player's ball, Brianni suits, y'all birds watch
# As real millionaire, shit'll take place
# Evil as Hitler's hate-race people
# This is God son, and I've come from the God under pure peace
# To represent the streets, you'll see that my plan
# is not to destroy your man
# But to bring more to mankind and teach
# Every MC reach for your pens and papers
# Lesson one be creative; what you made of junior?
# Cause soon you'll be a grown man with the mic in your hand
# And understand, to battle Nas not in your plan
# I'm the last real nigga alive, understand that
# And you my offspring, the boss sting
# A bulletproof Porsche things, hard for you to understand that
# Nas the king, where my bricks, where my band at?
# Play me a gangster's theme, while you entertain me
# If I ain't cryin laughin, to the lions, throw your ass in
# What the fuck was you niggaz thinkin?
# Guns'll clutch if I get a inklin that you comin for the kingpin
# But I laugh at you cowards, ha ha ha
# Take me out, try try try, but you

# You can't be me

# One moment
# Would you capture it or just let it slip
# His plams are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
# There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
# He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
# To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
# What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
# He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
# He's chokin, how everybody's jokin now
# The clocks run out, times up over, bloah!
# Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
# Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
# He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy
# No
# He won't have it , he knows his whole back's to these ropes
# It dont matter, he's dope
# He knows that, but he's broke
# He's so stacked that he knows
# When he goes back to his mobile home, thats when it's

# Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order

# He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
# Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
# Lonely roads, God only knows
# He's grown farther from home, he's no father
# He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
# But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
# His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
# They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
# He nose dove and sold nada

# Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
# All the pain inside amplified by the fact
# That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
# And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
# Cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers

# I hit harder than four men,
# Landing both gloves to a low blow with no cup
# Leave you Speech-less like when Arrested Development broke up
# Carry a crow bar for egos that won't budge
# Crack skulls ,through helmets,
# with the penetration of a screw ,nailed in,
# return like I was sending self addressed postage
# Throw bricks the size of the Stonehenge
# Before battles we pour blood and toast death to wicked infants
# found on the sorceress  ,doorsteps,
# Slaughter lamb ,and boar's head
# Every MC's cause of boredness and mind bondage
# Bronchitis, lung failure
# Language unfam-i-liar
# Art through a flooded air brush
# Road leave craft
# Sentences joined with words holding hands
# it's a tight squeeze
# From where your head will be landing in exact time flight leaves.

# I hate my life
# That's why I degrade my wife
# Grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich,and just ate the knife,
# My mother's screaming 'please heal and take him straight to Christ'
# Meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice
# Made a bomb threat with a fake device
# Strip you naked twice, pistol whip you and force you to take advice
# And if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit spittin'

# I'm wishin' I was dead
# While I'm fallin out of my bed
# Found it red and my rash is returning
# I feel the sensation of burning
# Occurring usually during pain for release in my urine
# Screamin' at my shadow 'please quit followin' me'

# [Chorus: 50 Cent]
# Niggas Know what I'm about out here
# I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to
# You can run your mouth I don't care
# but if you get too close I'm gonna clap you
# It's too real out here to be scared
# A real nigga is gonna do whatever he has to
# A man is the last thing you should fear
# it ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
# We all die one day
# [Obie Trice]
# Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna look
# like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
# Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and
# let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
# I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's moms
# shoot up clubs and destroy nigga's vibes
# everybody running for their motherfucking lives
# Tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely
# open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave
# your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
# O's an animals skirts get mirked
# don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
# don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard
# trust in guard it cause you're about to catch a bullet scar
# I give a fuck where you from who you be with
# keep this a secret right by the nuts
# a 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck
# [Chorus]
# [Lloyd Banks]
# But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks
# and make my cash stretch longer than giraff necks
# poverty will make your ass bet on words
# touch niggas in jail make them wanna finish their last sents'
# they say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun
# if that's the case then get a bigga one
# you don't think I pack the pump cause I'm out of the hood
# that's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump
# I where a white mink, the fabric is done
# got rings that bling like Mike, Byrd, Magic and them
# out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
# living lavash, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
# I'm the clouds you won't see me in the trains
# I travel first class you don't even got a TV on your plane
# You should be easy on my name, cause I don't going back and forth
# your boss and your captain's soft
# [Chorus]
# [Eminem]
# We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
# you want it? you gonna get it
# name em we gon hit em, chew em up and spit em out
# too much venom and if you role with 'em
# we gonna fuck you up with 'em
# I got too much momentum movin in my direction to lose
# my shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in 'em (BROOM)
# you know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through
# G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assasins
# ski masks and gloves consider this as a warning
# disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
# but we are fizast, fuck your litte bitch ass up
# we are not killers, my vato will have you shot-o
# drag through the varrio and fucked like Kim Osario
# litte sorry hoe ass, go ask B Real
# we burn source covers like fuckin Cypress Hill
# did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still
# shady records you better believe the hype is real
# this is no joke, I don't smoke
# but I toke enuff second hand to make my fuckin P.O. choke
# I'm an OG, you're fuckin with a GI Joe
# Bia Bia, mia meo a vida loca
# I'm a psycho, Mariah aint got shit on me
# when I retire I'll be spittin baby food on people
# a tent sieged on her ranch, huddled up next to her
# with Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
# you ever had your gap pealed back or your shit pushed in
# I put my blade in your like a fucking pin cushion
# slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Hindoff
# I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sindoff
# Nobody told you that I'm loco essey?
# I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
# I'm slim sha...dy and the d is for deez nuts
# and you can get each one for free so feast up
# I pee in a cup for three months, I'm having an E party for easter please come
# [50 Cent]
# We gonna bring it to anybody, you want it?
# you gonna get it!
# Name 'em we gonna hit 'em, chew 'em up 'n spit 'em out,
# too much venom
# You could do all them push ups to pump up your chest
# I got a 12 gauge Marksburg, to pump up ya chest,
# have you gasping for air after that shell hits your vest,
# fear me like you fear god cause I bring death.
# Silverback gorrilla in the concrete jungle
# I'm the strongest one around you know how I get down
# I watch gansta flicks and root for the badguy
# and turn it off before it ends cause the badguy die
# if you trying to buy guns I'm the nigga to look to
# so what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
# you can raise your voice like you fending to touch something
# when I raise my knife shit I'm fending to cut something
# see I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie
# if the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me
# (haha Sorry Kim haha)

# There's an intruder in my house
# He cut my phoneline, can't dial out
# I scream for police, but I doubt
# they gonna hear me, when I shout (heh)
# [Verse1]
# A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
# There's a couple of cops hot on my trail but this time
# When I get pulled over, there's a Doberman Pincher
# And a Pitbull in the seat, these pigs will get bit foolin' wit' me
# Quit foolin' wit' me, bitch you're gonna see
# No pistol in the seat, why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
# And which you're gonna see in the long run, imma be the wrong one
# You wanna harass with this limo tinted glass flashin' that flashlight
# on my ass, where was you that last night when them assholes
# Ran up on my grass, rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
# They took away my right to bare arms, what, i'm sposed to fight with bare palms?
# Yeah right, they comin with bombs, i'm comin with flare guns
# We as Americans
# [Chorus]
# We as Americans, us as a citizen, gotta protect ourselves
# Look at how shit has been, we better check ourselves
# Livin up in these streets through worse and through better health
# Survivin by any means; We as Americans, us as a citizen
# We are samaritans, what did we get us in
# We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
# Take a look where you live
# This is America and we are Americans
# [verse 2]
# I'ma make a few bucks, wear a cool vest
# Drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex
# I coulda been next to fly over the cookoo's nest
# But you know who, with a S tattooed to my chest
# But I finessed it, now I got the industry pissy
# Ever since me and Dre split it 50/50 on 50
# It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin quicker
# Then mankin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
# Fuck money, I don't rap with dead presidents
# I'd rather see the president dead
# It's never been said but I set precedents
# And the standards and they can't stand it
# My name shoulda been bastard, the shit shoulda been plastered
# On my forhead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
# I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
# But i'm too swift and fast for that, i'm past it
# I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot
# Fuck that shit! I dun seen how fast this rap shit
# Can turn into some pap pap shit that quick
# Snap click, but this time I got the fuckin au-to-ma-tic
# And no one gon' test this mind, clack click
# [chorus]
# We as Americans, us as a citizen, gotta protect ourselves
# Look at how shit has been, we better check ourselves
# Livin up in these streets through worse and through better health
# Survivin by any means; We as Americans, us as a citizen
# We are samaritans, what did we get us in
# We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
# Take a look where you live
# This is America and we are Americans
# [Verse 3]
# I got a secret if you can keep it between us
# I tuck two Nina's under my jeans, either side of my penis
# Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
# One run in with the long arm of the law, i'm long gone
# I'ma do five years, no less then that, no questions asked
# What might be a good idea, that I stop right here
# And quit while i'm ahead, already in the red
# Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
# A target on my back, bigger problems than that
# Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send the task
# I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
# They ain't gon' give me my semi but I got my ... mack
# [Chorus]
# We as Americans, us as a citizen, gotta protect ourselves
# Look at how shit has been, we better check ourselves

# Click click boom, just as soon as we hit the room
# You can hear 'em holla Goon Squad in this bitch
# Let me hear you holla Goon Squad in this bitch
# Let me hear you holla Runyon Ave. in this bitch
# So who am I gonna call on when I ain't got them boys with me
# And the situation gets a little sticky
# I'ma dial 911 like a motherfuckin' punk, fuck that, bla bla
# I'ma call that rude boy from Detroit, Trick Trick
# Quick come pick me up, bring them guns
# Come to the club, meet me out front
# There's some chump up in this bitch
# Poppin' some junk cause he's drunk
# And we may have to fuck his ass up
# Cause uh, somethin' smells a lil' fishy
# And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin' at me
# So homie come get me, Chedda boys what up though I see you
# Rock Bottom, yeah I see you, all my Detroit people
# Where you at man, let me see them hands in the sky
# Detroit motherfuckers 'till we die
# [Chorus - Eminem]
# Where's my gangstas and all my thugs
# Throw them hands up and show some love
# And I Welcome you to Detroit City
# I said Welcome to Detroit City
# Every place, everywhere we go
# Man we deep everywhere we roll
# Ask around and they all know Tricky
# That's what's good man they all say Tricky
# [Verse 2 - Trick Trick]
# Homie it's been a long time comin' and I'm straight with that
# Marshall call me the fifty ?? and laced the track
# This the beat, you hear it bangin', he produced it himself
# My bad, almost forgot to introduce myself
# My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Squad
# And gangsta been bangin' the underground since '95, we're bangin'
# Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
# Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
# You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
# All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
# Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
# I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
# Accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
# A quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
# And my boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
# Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house
# [Chorus - Eminem]
# [Verse 3 - Trick Trick]
# Ayo Em, you ever need one of these weapons come get it
# From now on every beef that you get in, homie I'm in it
# I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
# I been whippin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
# So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
# The public, see they appreciate my criminal past
# Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
# Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
# I'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine
# And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
# I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can fear me
# Only speakin' on what I know so the world can hear me
# So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
# He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner
# So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
# And beat the hell outta anybody that fuck with us
# [Chorus - Eminem]
# [Outro]
# Yeah, Trick Trick
# Eminem, Wonder Boy, Shady
# It's goin' down baby
# Ayo Em, I got you back my nigga
# Damn right I said my nigga
# That's my nigga

# Yo I got an idea
# Let me go grab Sticky right quick
# **sounds of steps**
# Hey yo Stick, Stick
# [Sticky]
# Yo Slim Shady
# Yo I just had like a nightmah..
# Wait it wasn't like a nightmare
# It was like a good dreah..
# Well it wasn't a good.. (What was it?)
# Hey yo I just had a crazy dream man (What?)
# Yo, yo I dreamed I was white! (Ohhh)
# Chorus: Eminem
# If he was white
# What if he was white?
# What if he was white?
# What - If - He - Was - White?
# What if he was white?
# What if he was
# white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
# Verse One : Sticky Fingaz
# Yo, yo
# What if I was white skin the same color as cocaine?
# Blond hair, blue eyes
# The whole shibang
# I know one thing
# Police wouldn't always be watching me
# Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me
# (Can I get your autograph?)
# Yellow cabs in the cities that stop for me
# I wouldn't need caladeral to buy property
# If I was white
# Wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
# SECURITY wouldn't follow me around the store
# Like I'd steal something (Maybe he might of stole something)
# Because I'm black I rob
# And automatically assume I ain't got no job
# On my own land I feel like an immigrant
# If I was white
# I wouldn't thought O.J. was innocent (He did it)
# Chorus: Eminem
# If I was white
# What if he was white?
# What if he was white? (Yo think about that)
# What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (for a minute)

# Verse Two: Sticky Fingaz
# If I was white
# It would be a different world for me
# If I was white (ummmmmmmm?)
# What shade would I be?
# Would I be Redneck or Skinhead, prepi or high class?
# YOU PROBABLY LIVE IN A TRAILERPARK AND BE WHITE TRASH!
# In any case that be ill shit right? (Yep)
# But there's a good and bad out of being white
# You can't say the N word without starting a fight
# (What's UP MY BROTHER?)
# True dance it'll be, I had two left feet
# Even if I was white
# Plaque still have a ghetto shit (How you doing?)
# Is it a minfo
# Or do I really have a little dick (Nah, it's true!)
# If I was white
# I would probably listen to hardcore rock
# and covered my ears when ever I heard Hip Hop (Ahhhhhhhhhhhh)
# Chorus: Eminem
# If he was white
# What if he was white?
# What if he was white? (What if he was white?)
# What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white

# What if he was white? (What if you were white?)
# What if he was
# white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? (What if he was white?)
# Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz
# Yo,yo,yo, if I was white
# I probably wouldn't even think the same
# I watched Tennis and golf and bet on Hockey games (Red Wings Man)
# Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
# If I was white
# I couldn't live around my way
# In it probably wouldn't never even been an Onyx shit
# I be serice sippin vadka and tonixs
# Smokin on them all on a marboral
# instead of a nueport
# I live in Long Island
# Instead of New York
# If I was white
# I probably couldn't dunk
# Cuz everybody knows white man can't jump (Nope!)
# And probably wouldn't be able to go to the trees spots
# Cuz all the niggas trend think I was a cop
# Chorus: Eminem
# If he was white
# What if he was white?
# What if he was white?
# What - If - He - Was - White?(Yo you can't say that)
# What if he was white

# What's the difference between me and you? (repeat 2X)
# [Dr. Dre]
# Back when Cube - was rollin wit Lorenzo in a Benzo
# I was bangin wit a gang of instrumentals
# Got the pens and pencils, got down to business; but sometimes
# the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
# But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
# I still remember the window of the car that you went through
# That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
# And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
# Cuz you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit you
# Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit you
# You see the truth is
# Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
# And who I'm still cool wit
# Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with
# Claimin that they non-violent, talkin like they *voice sample*
# Spit venom in interviews, speakin on reunions
# Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
# Until then - I ain't even speakin your name
# Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same
# Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
# It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
# That's the difference
# Chorus: Phish (repeat 2X)
# What's the difference between me and you?
# You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
# I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
# I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin
# Yo I stay wit it
# While you try to perpetrate, play wit it
# Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (YEAH)
# I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
# I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
# (Yeah!) Come and get it, shitted on villians by the millions
# I be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings
# So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
# I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)
# A heartless bastard, high and plastered
# My style is like the reaction from too much acid - never come down
# Pass it around if you can't handle it
# Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates
# What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
# About five back accounts, three ounces and two vehicles
# Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
# I suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left
# Yo that's the difference
# Chorus
# Aight, hold up hold up!
# STOP THE BEAT A MINUTE!! I got somethin to say
# Dre; I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me
# (The fuck?!) I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
# I got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit
# Riiight? .. Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
# But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
# I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed - who's throat is it?
# Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
# Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
# But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
# I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
# And cruise around wit her for seven hours through California
# And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner
# at the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her
# Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
# Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of
# Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
# Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up
# and they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
# That's for tryin to talk like The Chronic was lost product
# That's for even THINKIN of havin them thoughts thought up!
# You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up!!
# So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
# Or we can scream, "I Just Don't Give a Fuck," and see who means it!
# Chorus 1.25X
> Eminem
# Yeah... It's my life...
# In my own words, I guess...
# Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
# Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
# When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armour,
# And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her,
# But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
# And everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
# What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
# "Daddy look what I made!", Dad's gotta go catch a plane,
# "Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"
# I don't know, go play Hailie baby, your daddy's busy,
# Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself,
# I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself,
# Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her,
# And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her,
# That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy,
# Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-by-baby...
# And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn,
# Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice,
# Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling,
# And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain,
# Just smile back. (2x)
# I keep having this dream, I'm pushing Hailie on the swing,
# She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing,
# "You're making Mommy cry. Why? Why is Mommy crying?
# Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying,
# You always say that. You always say this is the last time,
# But you ain't leaving no more. Daddy you're mine!"
# She's piling boxes in front of the door, trying to block it,
# "Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy, no stop it!"
# Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket,
# It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe daddy, take it withchya!
# I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror,
# These fucking walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em,
# They're saying "you've got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight,
# Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em before it's too late,"
# And just as I go to walk out my bedroom door,
# It turns to a stage, they're gone, and the spotlight is on,
# And I'm singing...
# And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn,
# Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice,
# Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling,
# And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain,
# Just smile back.(2x)
# Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat,
# The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet,
# I take a bow and thank you all for coming out,
# They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd,
# I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing,
# "Daddy it's me, help mommy her wrists are bleeding!"
# But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
# "I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leaving,
# You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad,
# And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad!',
# That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin,
# I get the point... fine! me and Mommy are going!",
# But baby wait!
# "It's too late Dad, you made the choice.
# Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us!",
# That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screaming your name,
# It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill,
# Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, Word, kid, keep it real!,
# I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see,
# How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me?
# I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it,
# Put it to my brain, scream 'Die Shady!' and pop it,
# The sky darkens, my life flashes,
# The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes,
# That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singing,
# It's spring and, Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her,
# Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister,
# Almost as if to..say..
# And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn,
# Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice,
# Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling,
# And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain,
# Just smile back. (2x)

# What about the make-up you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?
# (Hmm?)  So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
# when his bus driver's screamin at him, fuckin him up worse
# ("Go sit the fuck down, you little fuckin prick!")
# And fuck was the first word I ever learned
# up in the third grade, flippin the gym teacher the bird (Look!)

# I never knew I.. knew I'd..
# have a new house or a new car
# A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
# I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
# Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby-de-doo-wop (what?)
# Skibbedy-be-bop, a-Christopher Reeves
# Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin some trees (HEY!)
# How many retards'll listen to me
# and run up in the school shootin when they're pissed at a
# teach-er, her, him, is it you is it them?
# "Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!"
# Damn!  How much damage can you do with a pen?
# Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
# if you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought
# Slim Shady would be somethin that you woulda bought
# that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
# I just said it - I ain't know if you'd do it or not
# [Chorus]
# [Eminem]
# How the fuck was I supposed to know?

# i'd like to ask you from the start
# if u could pull me out the dark
# or if our love would fall apart
# like cookies crumble
# see i'm a demon on the loose
# i'm like an engine with no caboose
# and i need somebody who can really handle me
# chorus (2x):
# yeah baby im a wild one
# don't let me run
# don't let me get away
# yeah baby im a wild wild one
# i just wanna let u know girl
# i'm attracted to ur physical
# but i got this lazy eye that likes to wander
# u see i'm tired of feelin alone
# so if u throw this dog a bone
# maybe you and i can make our house a home
# yeah
# chorus (2x)
# oh you could be the one who saves me
# or try to be the one who tames me
# girl you are the one who's changin my way of life
# i'm tired of paintin the town with ladies

# i'm tired of all their lies

# Guess who's back
# Back again
# Shady's back
# Tell a friend
# Guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back
# guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back.. {*Eminem hums*}
# [Verse 1: Eminem]
# I've created a monster, cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
# They want Shady, I'm chopped liver (huh?)
# Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
# A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
# Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
# than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
# by the doctor when I'm not co-operating
# When I'm rockin the table while he's operating (hey!!)
# You waited this long, now stop debating
# Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovu-lating
# I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
# but your husband's heart problem's complicating
# So the FCC won't let me be
# or let me be me, so let me see
# They try to shut me down on MTV
# But it feels so empty, without me
# So, come on and dip, rum on your lips
# Fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
# And get ready, cause this shit's about to get heavy
# I just settled all my lawsuits, FUCK YOU DEBBIE!
# [Chorus: Eminem]
# Now this looks like a job for me
# So everybody, just follow me
# Cause we need a little, controversy
# Cause it feels so empty, without me
# I said this looks like a job for me
# So everybody, just follow me
# Cause we need a little, controversy
# Cause it feels so empty, without me
# [Verse 2: Eminem]
# Little Hellions, kids feelin rebellious
# Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
# They start feelin like prisoners helpless
# 'til someone comes along on a mission and yells BITCH!!!
# A visionary, vision of scary
# Could start a revolution, pollutin the airwaves
# A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
# in the fact that I got everyone kissin my ass {*smak*}
# And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
# for you to see so damn much of my ass; you asked for me?
# Well I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
# {*bzzt*} Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
# enter in, in the front of your skin like a splinter
# The center of attention, back for the winter
# I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
# Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
# {*bzzt*} Testing, attention please
# Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
# Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
# A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
# [Chorus]
# [Verse 3: Eminem]
# A-tisket a-tasket, I go tit for tat with
# anybody who's talkin this shit, that shit
# Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
# worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
# And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
# You thirty-six year old baldheaded fag, blow me
# You don't know me, you're too old, let go
# It's over, nobody listen to techno
# Now let's go, just gimme the signal
# I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
# I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
# ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol {*knife slices*}
# But sometimes the shit just seems
# everybody only wants to discuss me
# So this must mean I'm dis-gus-ting
# But it's just me, I'm just obscene
# No I'm not the first king of controversy
# I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
# to do black music so selfishly
# and used it to get myself wealthy
# (Hey!!) There's a concept that works
# Twenty million other white rappers emerge
# But no matter how many fish in the sea
# It'll be so empty, without me

# [Chorus: Eminem]
# My words are weapons

# My words are weapons
# I never show no emotion
# My words are weapons
# I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me
# My words are like weaponry on a record

# I never did show no emotion
# My words are weapons
# I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me
# My words are like weaponry on a record
# Yo, the rage I release on a page
# is like a demon unleashed in a cage
# Lunatic, soon as I hit the stage
# My mind is like a fuckin stick of dynamite
# Onen I get behind the mic
# it's like the wick is lit you bitches die tonight
# My nine is like a guidin light at night shinin bright
# My fuckin grip is tighter than my wife's vagina, psych
# These cock-suckin cops got my Smith-N-Wesson
# I guess it's time to pick a different weapon, man the shit's depressin
# But Swift is getting me a new one for a Christmas present
# (Swift: "Come on Slim, let's go and teach this fuckin bitch a lesson")
# They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish
# But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage
# Shady stay creative baby hold your head up, don't you let up
# one bit on these motherfuckin suckers you're a soldier +GET UP+
# STAND UP FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN, LONG AS YOU BREATHIN
# THEY JEALOUS OF YOU MAN THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THEY BEEFIN!

# It's that Dirty Dozen renegade
# You done pulled the pin out my grenade
# .38'sll move your shit up out the way
# You niggas wont forget about McVeigh; you got somethin to say?
# Let it out today or watch these bullets spray
# from these ten black fingers huggin these deadly millimeters
# that'll make Jeff Dahmer's look like he caught a misdemeanor
# See I'm +Dirty+, so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
# An official beater, don't let me see you with yo' heater
# You gets whipped with it, tell them motherfuckers Swift did it
# You packin somethin special in your crib then bitch get it
# I'm physically fitted to run yo' digits, I'm hostile (uh-huh)
# with this Roscoe pointed up your nostrils
# You get splitted and guess what, I'm blowin up the hospital
# and wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a hoe
# I'm Hannibal Lector, the spinal cord disconnector

# I'm eatin crews like I'm Hannibal
# There's no way I can be the gay rapper
# (Eminem: Why not?) I only fuck animals (Oh! Ha-ha)
# Stupid trick got my dick startin to itch
# Went to my mother's grave site, called her a stupid bitch
# One on one in this bloodsport
# I'm in divorce court, sold my bitch off a pack of Newports

# I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
# Spend a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
# Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
# I can't rap anymore - I just murdered the alphabet
# Drug sickness got me doin some bugged twitches
# I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
# I don't rap to get the women - fuck bitches
# Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
# Never ran with a click   I'm a posse
# Kamikaze, strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me
# From the second I was born, my momma lost me
# I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
# I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
# My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
# Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
# Fuck, I was born during the earthquake

# [Intro]
# What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough. If you wish to be
# saved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or
# which over. We seem to be approaching an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should
# move up from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better.
# [Verse 1- Eminem]
# Come on, let's cut the bullshit enough
# Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up
# Let's take this shit back to basement
# And we can disscuss statements thats made on this tape
# And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love
# The music that we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy
# Let's rewind it to 89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit
# Crossin 8 Mile into Warren, into hick territory
# I'd like to share a story, this is my story and cant no body tell it for me
# You will well inform me, I am well aware that I don't belong here
# You've made that perfectly clear, I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
# From Bel-Air shopping center just for stopping in there
# From the black side all the way to the white side
# Okay there's a bright side a day that I might slide
# You may call it a past I call it haulin my ass
# Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
# Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
# Them good old notorious oh well known tracks
# [Chorus x2]
# So lets go back
# Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
# Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
# I once used to call home sweet home
# [Verse 2- Eminem]
# I roam the streets so much they call me a drifter
# Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitch hike
# Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 mile and Van Dyke
# And steal a god damn bike from somebody's backyard
# And drop it off at the park that was the half way mark
# To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
# To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
# Thats about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps
# At Osbourne handing out some flyers, he was doin some talent shows
# At Centerline High, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime
# He looked at me like I'm out my mind shook his head like white boys dont know how to rhyme
# I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
# And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
# We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit with compound syllables sound combined
# From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line
# [Chorus x2]
# So lets go back
# Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
# Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
# I once used to call home sweet home
# [Verse 3- Eminem]
# My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
# It was cool till your man MC Shan came through
# And said that Puma's The Brand 'cause the clan makes troops
# It was rumors but man, god damn, they flew
# Musta been true because man we done banned they shoes
# I had the new ones the Cool J, Ice land swayed too
# And we just through them in the trash like they yesterday's news
# Guess who came through next, X-clan debut
# Professor X vanglorious exists in a state of red, black, and green
# With a key sissies now with this bein a new trend
# We don't fit in crackas is out with Cactus albums
# Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
# Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant
# Me and my man Howard and Butter, we would go to the mall with 'em
# All over our necks like we're showin 'em off not knowin at all
# We was bein laughed at you ain't even half black
# You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that
# And that Flavor Flave clock we gon' have to snatch that
# All I remember is meetin back at Manix's basement
# Sayin' how we hate this, how racist but dope the x clan take this
# Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
# She was tryna two time me and there was this black girl
# At our school who thought I was cool cuz I rapped so she was kinda eyein me
# And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gon' say it plus
# The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
# The bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull it
# Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
# But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
# And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl
# But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
# But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize
# I was wrong cuz no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe
# [Chorus x2]
# So lets go back
# Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
# Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place

# Welcome back, to the stage of history
# [Eminem]
# Yo.. Slim Shady!
# Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll..
# I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)
# Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
# The only key that I see to defeat you
# would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
# and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
# I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
# you'll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you
# (Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin G, I'm a cannibal
# I ain't tryin to shoot you,
# I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
# Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
# and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
# Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)
# Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
# I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket
# to fill it full of explosive gasses
# and close it back with a lit match in it
# while I sit back and just hope it catches
# Blow you to fragments
# Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes
# Chorus: J-Black (repeat 2X)
# I see the light at the end
# But every time I take a step, it gets dim
# Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
# If so, heaven's got to be better
# But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
# [J-Black]
# Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never)
# I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
# I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
# Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot
# One day we all gon' die
# But when I die, I'ma be so high
# that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
# with the chalk outline still there
# I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
# I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
# Now if I pray everynight (night)
# Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
# You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
# I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
# I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
# Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
# See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface
# Nickle nine at my waist, God done lost faith
# Angels greet me but I don't reply back
# Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?

# Maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
# Final battle, fight!
# [Masta Ace]
# Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
# Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
# And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
# Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
# I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
# And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
# My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
# Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
# Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
# Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
# My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
# My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
# Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
# Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
# I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
# Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care

# When you're alone and life is making you lonely
# You can always go - downtown
# When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
# Seems to help, I know - downtown
# Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
# Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
# How can you lose?
# The lights are much brighter there
# You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
# So go downtown, things'll be great when you're
# Downtown - no finer place, for sure
# Downtown - everything's waiting for you
# Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
# There are movie shows - downtown
# Maybe you know some little places to go to
# Where they never close - downtown
# Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
# You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
# Happy again
# The lights are much brighter there
# You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
# So go downtown, where all the lights are bright
# Downtown - waiting for you tonight
# Downtown - you're gonna be all right now
# And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
# Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
# Guide them along
# So maybe I'll see you there
# We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
# So go downtown, things'll be great when you're
# Downtown - don't wait a minute more
# Downtown - everything's waiting for you

# But now it's plain to see
# She chose him over me
# Every day she's smiling in my face

# llegas derepente a mi vida
# y escazamente te conozco o se de ti
# yo no se que tengas en la mente
# pero te advierto que algo raro pasa en mi
# dime de donde vienes
# de que extraÃ�Â¹o mundo eres tu
# que sin pedir nada a cambio
# tu te entregas como nadie
# le das luz a mis dias
# Estrib.
# Intrusa, tan solo es una intrusa
# que me ha robado el sueÃ�Â¹o y le ha devuelto
# la esperanza al corazon
# intrusa, tan solo es una intrusa
# que me ha robado el aaaalma
# tan solo es una intrusa
# llegas y me cambias el destino
# rompiendo ezquemas de la vida antes de ti
# sanas con tus manos mis heridas
# y con tus labios borras cada sicatriz
# dime que es lo que quieres
# no puedo librarme de ti
# ya ya no tengo defensas
# y es que eres como nadie
# le das vida a mis dias
# Estrib.
# Intrusa, tan solo es una intrusa
# que me ha robado el sueÃ�Â¹o y le ha devuelto

# You left me for the bright lights of the town
# A country boy set out to see the world
# Remember when those neon lights shine down
# That big old moon shines on your Kentucky girl
# I swear I love you by the moon above you
# How bright is it shining in your world
# Some morning when you wake up all alone
# Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl
# Don't wait to bring great riches home to me
# I need no diamond rings or fancy pearls
# Just bring yourself, you're all I'll ever need
# That's good enough for this blue Kentucky girl
# I swear I love you by the moon above you
# How bright is it shining in your world
# Some morning when you wake up all alone
# Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl
# Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl

# I know your leaving is  too long overdue
# For far too long I've had nothing new to show to you
# Thru dry eyes I watched your plane
# Fade off west of the moon
# And it felt so strange to walk away alone
# No regrets    no tears goodbye
# Don't want you back we'd only cry again
# Say goodbye a---gain
# The hours that were yours echo like empty rooms
# The thoughts we used to share I now keep alone
# I woke last night and spoke your name
# Not thinking you were gone
# And it felt so strange to lie awake alone
# No regrets no tears goodbye
# Don't want you back we'd only cry again
# Say goodbye a---gain
# Our friends have tried to turn my nights to day
# Strange faces in your place can't keep the ghosts away
# Just behind the darkest hour just before dawn
# It still feels so strange to lead my life alone
# No regrets no tears goodbye
# Don't want you back we'd only cry again
# Say goodbye a---gain

# No Fool No More
# lyrics: Packed up all the pain
# Left the tears outside my door
# And I'm not going to be the one
# Who's left out in the rain no more
# I see it so clearly
# The writing is on the wall
# Telling me I'm going to be alright after all
# Now I've open my eyes
# And I'm finally wise
# No, no, no fool no more
# 1- No fool no more
# Not like before
# Not the way it used to be
# No fool no more
# No tears this time
# Cause this time I'm wise
# To the game that's been going on
# And I'm not going to be no fool no more
# Ooh, ooh, no fool
# No room for sad regrets
# Cause the past is done and gone
# And I learned that it's time that makes you wise
# And truth that makes you strong
# You thought you were so cool
# Pulled the wool right over my heart
# Now you see that you can't keep this heart in the dark
# Cause I see through your lies
# Won't be blind one more time
# No, no, no fool no more
# Repeat 1
# Going to pull my heart together
# Going to leave the past behind
# Going to get to something better
# Put you out of my mind (out of my mind)
# I'm going to be strong
# I'm going to be fine
# I just want you to know
# That I'm not going to be no fool no more

# It's a winter day, five years too late
# I'm feelin' cold inside
# Holdin' on to what I don't know
# No more reasons, no more wise
# Just my life, and my love I worked so hard to keep
# Oooh, sad but true
# Sad but true
# It will be a very different world without him
# So I just can't up and let him go
# What would my children say?
# Mad, just a little sad
# Just a little had, just a little
# Had just a little time for me
# Not good you see
# I need just a little more
# Just a little life, just a little
# Had just a little fun you see
# There's more to me
# When you're creepin' out at night
# Always tried to cry myself to sleep
# Sad but true, it won't work no more
# I must tell him so
# Goodbye is so hard to say
# So sad but true
# So sad but oh so true
# A world of make-believe
# It's a place I've lived
# Joyous all the time
# Never knew my world could cave in
# Fall in right before my eyes, I was blind
# I would only see the signs I wanted to see
# Ooh ooh ooh, sad but true
# Sad but true
# And it will
# You must take the time to deal with it
# Before you fall too deep in it
# Can't find your way back home, ooh
# Can't change his ways
# Won't change my ways
# If things stay the same
# No one wins the game
# I deserve better
# He needs it better
# I'm not so happy, he can't be happy
# Oh oh
# And I feel it in my soul
# Our love has come to an end
# Sad but true, it's not love no more
# I must tell him so
# Goodbye is so hard to say
# So sad but true
# So sad but oh so true

# Got a letter just the other day
# So much was left unsaid
# When you went away
# How my heart grew so cold
# From the misery of dreams ago
# An open envelop
# The last time that we spoke
# You said that you would always be my man
# And now this letter's here
# What will you say my dear?
# To bring me to emotions once again
# The truth of it you say
# There's never been day
# That you're not sorry you apologize
# But life teaches new things
# Beyond the pain it brings
# You to a place where you are truly wise
# Que sera, sera
# What will be will be
# I'm happy for you and me
# That we can finally see what was meant
# Que sera, sera
# What will be will be
# I'm happy for you and me
# That we can finally see what was meant
# I know we've made mistakes
# Cause love is give and take
# I mean to say it wasn't all your fault
# I too had some regrets
# Such pain I've felted yet
# It's better to have love than not at all
# The memories we had of all the good and bad
# Has helped me be the woman that I am
# So don't apologize
# I've come to realize
# Just what is meant by all in love is fair
# Que sera, sera
# What will be will be
# I'm happy for you and me
# That we can finally see what was meant
# Que sera, sera
# What will be will be
# I'm happy for you and me
# That we can finally see what was meant
# Sometimes it's just not meant to be
# But the love that we share goes on and on
# Spiritually there'll be no more crying
# No, and there'll be no more lying, no, no, no, no, no
# And the truth that we gained will offset the pain
# And now we finally see
# Que sera, sera
# What will be will be
# I'm happy for you and me
# That we can finally see what was meant
# Que sera, sera
# What will be will be
# I'm happy for you and me

# So play the song the way it used to be
# Before she left and changed it all to sadness
# And maybe if she's passing by the window
# She will hear our love song and the melody
# And even if the words are not so tender
# She will always remember the way it used to be

# I'm not talking 'bout moving in,
# And I don't want to change your life.
# But there's a warm wind blowing,
# The stars are out, and I'd really love to see you tonight.
# We could go walking through a windy park,
# Or take a drive along the beach.
# Or stay at home and watch t.v.
# You see, it really doesn't matter much to me.
# I'm not talking 'bout moving in,
# And I don't want to change your life.
# But there's a warm wind blowing,
# The stars are out, and I'd really love to see you tonight.
# I won't ask for promises,
# So you won't have to lie.
# We've both played that game before,
# Say I love you, then say goodbye.

# You'd teach me of honest things
# Things that were daring, things that were clean

# And I can't go on

# Wanna be with you

# Do you know what it feels like loving someone that’s in a rush to throw you away.
# Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.
# If birds flying south is a sign of changes
# At least you can predict this every year.
# Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly
# I can’t get it to speak
# Maybe finding all the things it took to save us
# I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
# Look in your eyes to see something about me
# I’m standing on the edge and I don’t know what else to give.
# Do you know what it feels like loving someone that’s in a rush to throw you away.

# Seeing your face no more on my pillow
# Is a scene that’s never happened to me.

# Since the beginning of time
# Since it started to rain
# Since I heard you laugh
# Since I felt your pain
# I was too young, you were much younger
# We were afraid of each other`s hunger
# I have always loved you
# There`s never been anyone else
# I knew you before I knew myself
# Oh my baby,
# I have always loved you
# Since we kissed the first time
# Since we slept on the beach
# You were too close for comfort
# You were too far out of reach
# You walked away,
# I should have held you
# Would you have stayed for me to tell you?
# I have always loved you
# There`s never been anyone else
# I knew you before I knew myself
# Oh my baby,
# I have always loved you
# Years go by in a matter of days
# And though we go separate ways
# I never stop dreaming of you
# I have always loved you
# And when you call it makes me cry
# We never made time for you and
# I If I could live it all again

# Dime princesa de hielo ?d?nde vas?
# Eres tan fr?a que ya me quemas.
# Eres mi alivio. Tambi?n me haces sufrir,
# y aunque lo ignores, yo no soy de piedra.
# Busco tu alma. YQui?n sabe d?nde est?!
# (mi fugitiva, mi carcelera)
# Haces que muera y me haces revivir.
# Juega conmigo. Hazme lo que quieras.
# YApunta! YDispara! Es s? o no.
# Reina, ?qu? soy yo?
# Algo que se tira o se usa.
# Amarte es igual que jugar
# a la ruleta rusa
# ?c?mo te puedo yo amar?
# Reina, ?yo qu? fu??
# Una marioneta, una excusa...
# Amarte es igual que perder
# a la ruleta rusa.
# ?c?mo te puedo ganar?
# ?c?mo te puedo querer?
# Tiro la toalla, y me vuelvo a levantar,
# y el verme herido te vuelve loca.
# Y ya no puedo de tanto suplicar,
# Y de bailar al son que t? me tocas.
# Quiero ablandarte y no hay nada que hacer.
# Tu coraz?n es como una roca.
# ?Quieres mi vida?. Qu?tamela ya
# Soy todo tuyo. Pide por tu boca.
# YApunta! YDispara! ?Es eso amor?
# Reina, ?qu? soy yo?
# Algo que se tira o se usa.
# Amarte es igual que jugar
# a la ruleta rusa

# Every day here you come walking
# I hold my tongue,
# I don`t do much talking
# You say you`re happy and you`re doin` fine
# Well go ahead, baby,
# I got plenty of time
# Sad eyes never lie
# Sad eyes never lie
# Well for a while
# I`ve been watching you steady
# Ain`t gonna move `til you`re good and ready
# You show up and then you shy away
# But I know pretty soon you`ll be walkin` this way
# Sad eyes never lie
# Sad eyes never lie
# Baby don`t you know I don`t care
# Don`t you know that I`ve been there
# Well if something in the air feels a little unkind
# Don`t worry darling, it`ll slip your mind
# I know you think you`d never be mine
# Well that`s okay, baby, I don`t mind
# That shy smile`s sweet, that`s a fact
# Go ahead,
# I don`t mind the act
# Here you come all dressed up for a date
# Well one more step and it`ll be too late
# Blue blue rib-bon in your hair
# Like you`re so sure
# I`ll be standing there
# Sad eyes never lie
# Sad
# Blue blue ribbon in your hair
# Like you`re so sure
# I`ll be standing there

# As the music draws you closer
# And you fall under my spell
# I will catch you
# In my arms now

# I don't know why
# You want to follow me tonight
# When in the rest of the world
# With you whom I've crossed and I've quarreled
# Let's me down so
# For a thousand reasons that I know
# To share forever the unrest
# With all the demons I possess
# Beneath the silver moon
# Maybe you were right
# But baby I was lonely
# I don't want to fight
# I'm tired of being sorry
# 8th and Ocean Drive
# With all the vampires and their brides
# We're all bloodless and blind
# And longing for a life
# Beyond the silver moon
# Maybe you were right
# But baby I was lonely
# I don't want to fight
# I'm tired of being sorry
# I'm standing in the street
# Crying out for you
# No one sees me
# But the silver moon
# So far away – so outer space
# I've trashed myself – I've lost my way
# I've got to get to you got to get to you
# Maybe you were right
# But baby I was lonely
# I don't want to fight
# I'm tired of being sorry
# I'm standing in the street
# Crying out for you
# No one sees me
# But the silver moon
# (lalalala till end)

# But baby I was lonely
# I don't want to fight
# I'm tired of being sorry

# Crying out for you

# I want to give my life to you
# but my will is tied with puppet strings
# I am fighting and screaming alone
# inside this empty room
# They let you down, threw you in the rain
# They let you down, sent you away... without a name
# The night is dark when you're alone
# and sometimes it can be so cruel
# The rain keeps falling on me so coldly
# 'cause your wishes didn't come true

# One lonely Sunday morning

# For in darkness I was walking
# And destruction lay around me
# From a fight I could not win
# Ah ah ah...
# She asked me name my foe then
# I said the need within some men
# To fight and kill their brothers
# Without thought of love or God
# And I begged her give me horses
# To trample down my enemy
# So eager was my passion
# To devour this waste of life
# Ah ah ah...
# But she would not think of battle that
# REDUCES men to animals
# So easy to begin
# And then impossible to end
# For she, the mother of all men
# had counselled me so wisely then
# I feared to walk alone again
# And asked if she would stay
# Ah ah ah...
# Oh lady lend your hand I cried
# And let me rest here at your side
# Have faith and trust
# In me she said
# And filled my heart with life
# There is no strength in numbers
# Have no such misconception
# But when you need me
# Be assured I won't be far away
# Ah ah ah...
# Thus having spoke she turned away
# And though I found no words to say
# I stood and watched until I saw
# Her black cloak disappear
# My labor is no easier
# But now I know I'm not alone
# I find new heart each time
# I think upon that windy day
# And if one day she comes to you

# Alone I've been walking this path every day

# I hear a song and I'm closing my eyes
# While it's sound is carresing my poor and sad mind
# Will you tonight give your promise to me
# For one day the silence will sleep in your dreams
# I've been waiting for so long time
# To see the light of golden bright sun
# I feel no sorrow in the heart of mine
# For the tears of life are now gone

# Dancing and singing with the red autumn leaves

# Cold as the northern winds

# My life goes on in endless song
# above earth's lamentations,
# I hear the real, though far-off hymn
# that hails a new creation.
# Through all the tumult and the strife
# I hear it's music ringing,
# It sounds an echo in my soul.
# How can I keep from singing?
# While though the tempest loudly roars,
# I hear the truth, it liveth.
# And though the darkness 'round me close,
# songs in the night it giveth.
# No storm can shake my inmost calm,
# while to that rock I'm clinging.
# Since love is lord of heaven and earth
# how can I keep from singing?
# When tyrants tremble in their fear
# and hear their death knell ringing,
# when friends rejoice both far and near
# how can I keep from singing?
# In prison cell and dungeon vile
# our thoughts to them are winging,
# when friends by shame are undefiled
# how can I keep from singing?

# Dawn breaks; there is blue in the sky.

# Signs from the heavens say I am the one.

# Now I know; I can see your light,

# You -- you could take my life away

# Now I know; I must leave your spell

# Have you heard the boys outside, when all the girls are skating
# Have you heard their sweet hearts cry for all this time they're waiting
# Green is in the mistletoe and red is in the holly
# Silver in the stars above that shine on everybody
# Gold is in the candlelight and crimson in the embers
# White is in the winter night that everyone remembers
# Have you seen the children playing, tiny hands are frozen
# Have you seen them hurry home, when suddenly its snowing
# Green is in the mistletoe and red is in the holly
# Silver in the stars above that shine on everybody
# Gold is in the candlelight and crimson in the embers
# White is in the winter night that everyone remembers
# Have you heard that bells are ringing, ringing out their story
# Have you heard the choir singing, Glory, Glory Glory

# Lyrics: Roma Ryan
# Ever close your eyes
# Ever stop and listen
# Ever feel alive
# And you've nothing missing
# You don't need a reason
# Let the day go on and on
# Let the rain fall down
# Everywhere around you
# Give into it now
# Let the day surround you
# You don't need a reason
# Let the rain go on and on
# What a day, what a day to take to
# What a way, what a way to make it through
# What a day, what a day to take to a wild child
# Only take the time
# From the helter skelter
# Every day you find
# Everything's in kilter
# You don't need a reason
# Let the day go on and on
# Every summer sun
# Every winter evening
# Every spring to come
# Every autumn leaving
# You don't need a reason
# Let it all go on and on
# What a day, what a day to take to
# What a way, what a way to make it through
# What a day, what a day to take to a wild child
# What a day, what a day to take to
# What a way, what a way to make it through
# What a day, what a day to take to a wild child
# What a day, what a day to take to
# What a way, what a way to make it through
# What a day, what a day to take to
# Da-da-da
# Da-da-da-da-da-da
# What a way, what a way to make it through
# Da-da-da
# Da-da-da-da-da-da
# Da-da-da
# Da-da-da-da-da-da
# What a way, what a way to make it through
# What a day, what a day to take to a wild child
# What a day, what a day to take to a wild child

# My world just shattered
# You let me chill down in my tears

# Cuz everytime I close my eyes
# I can't help but cry cuz I'm not with you
# I see you in my dreams
# I try to hold you but you're not there
# Everytime I close my eyes
# I wish deep inside
# You were in my life
# The only time that I can see you is
# Everytime that I close my eyes
# No
# Can't even sleep
# All the guys I don't want to meet, no
# Not even fair to go through it
# I only try to compare them to you
# Heaven above
# Only knows how deep I fell in love
# I hope you felt the pain
# I'm feelin inside
# I'm feel all torn up
# If you'd only talked to me
# Maybe in your arms still my dream
# Can you tell me what I've done
# You said I was the only one
# Baby please, come back home

# Eagle flew out of the night
# He was something to observe
# Came in close, I heard a voice
# Standing stretching every nerve
# Had to listen had no choice
# I did not believe the information
# Just had to trust imagination
# My heart going boom boom boom
# "Son," he said "Grab your things
# I've come to take you home"
# To keepin' silence I resigned
# My friends would think I was a nut
# Turning water into wine
# Open doors would soon be shut
# So I went from day to day
# Although my life was in a rut
# 'Till I thought of what I'd say
# Which connection I should cut
# I was feeling part of the scenery
# I walked right out of the machinery
# My heart going boom boom boom
# "Hey" he said "Grab your things
# I've come to take you home"

# I'm never where I wanna be
# And liberty she pirouette
# When I think that I am free
# Watched by empty silhouettes
# Who close their eyes but still can see
# No one taught them etiquette
# I will show another me

# Če v žilah je kri, pa tudi če ni,
# vsaka nam roža,sam enkrat cveti.
# Zdaj roža cveti, se nosi, smeji,
# polna vsega, vse zaslepi.
# A bog nad bogovi, močnejši kot vsi, on Čas je prekleti in roža odcveti.
# Še par dolgih dni, samotnih noči, Čas je res svinja, ...roža uveni.

# CHORUS:
# I just wanna do something real to you
# Like a real brother is supposed to do
# Just tell me how you feel baby
# I'll give you something real baby
# (repeat)
# VERSE 1:
# Let's not pretend, I promise if we keep it real
# Girl you will discover I'll give you pleasure like no other
# It's very spiritual but also physical
# Mere words can't tell, you'll have to feel it for yourself
# (Come on, come on)
# Because it's here, right here my dear
# Something that makes you smile again
# Something that takes all night and then
# I'm going to be the one that's still here, right here my dear
# The physical's only part of it
# Give me a chance to show you a deeper love
# Give you something real
# CHORUS
# VERSE 2:
# Let me make this clear, I've been doing this for years
# Now I understand what a woman needs from her man
# Spending money on my baby, take a trip downtown and daily
# I'ma drive you like Miss Daisy, ain't no nigga that can fade me
# Baby I'm here, right here my dear
# You don't even have to say a word
# Your body is calling and I heard
# I just wanna make sure baby I'm clear, I'm clear
# We'll take it slow so you can feel
# Every bit of all that I got to give
# And it's all for real
# CHORUS
# BRIDGE:
# Let me come inside tonight
# I'll take you places only we two can find
# I just wanna give you something you can feel
# Because I know there's no one better
# I'm just keeping it real
# CHORUS
> Eric Benet
# Here in my mind
# Replaying every line
# Remembering all of the love we made
# You told me only yesterday
# Nothing could take your love away
# Here in this room so many traces of you
# So many nights lying by your side
# Sleeping with secrets deep inside
# Secrets your eyes could not deny
# Chorus 1:
# Come as you are
# Lay with me
# Beautiful lies once more tell me
# With all the love in my heart
# I'll set you free
# Now that your eyes have said good-bye
# I found joy so pure
# My heart secure
# With the love the two of us would share
# And though it all seems so unfair
# No one's to blame when love's not there
# My whole life has changed
# Feels like I'll surely go insane
# 'Cause my world revolved 'round
# a love that never was
# Before I say good-bye to love
# Just hold me until the morning comes
# Chorus 2:
# Come as you are stay with me
# Kiss me once more before you leave
# With all the pain in my heart
# I'll set you free
# Now that your eyes have said good-bye
# Well I know it's not easy
# Finding words to let me know
# But the pain of make believing
# is much more than just letting go
# Chorus 1
# Chorus 2
> Eric Benet
# Maybe we need just a little more time
# Time that can heal what's been on your mind
# You can find what we lost before it all slips away
# We need time to mend from the mistakes I've made
# God only knows what a heart can survive
# So many tears from all the pain in our lives
# And where else could we go after all we've been through
# I still believe my life is right here with you
# So just hold on
# And it'll wont take long
# I hope that you can love me
# When the pain is gone
# I don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart
# Don't want us to fall through the cracks of your broken heart
# I know its taking a while but every lesson, i've learned
# And if your heart speaks tonight, I'll hear every word
# If you want to be free I'll never stand in your way
# But with all that I am, I'm asking you to stay
# Hold on
# And it'll wont take long
# I hope that you can love me
# When the pain is gone
# I don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart
# Don't want us to fall through the cracks of your broken heart
# There's a light that can burn
# It exists in the heart
# You can feel it when you know love is true
# If you could try to be strong
# And keep the light burning long
# It took a lifetime but i found it in you
# Hold on
# And it'll wont take long
# I hope that you can love me
# When the pain is gone
# I don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart
# Don't want us to fall through the cracks of your broken heart

# Love once left me cold and gray
# I had almost reached heaven
# Just to feel it slip away
# But life's too short to waste away
# Being scared to take chances
# Or so I've heard wise men say
# I wanna be loved
# Faithful and true
# I wanna be loved
# Ten million lifetimes with you
# I wanna be loved
# And after all I've been through
# I'll let my heart take it's chances, just to be loved by you
# Taste, touch, hear, see, feel me now girl
# And you'll know I'm so ready
# To exchange lifelong vows, yes I am
# 'Cause now you've shown me how God has smiled
# On this chance and this moment
# For this I've prayed all my life
# I wanna be loved
# Faithful and true
# I wanna be loved
# Ten million lifetimes with you girl
# I wanna be loved
# And after all I've been through
# I'll let my heart take its chances, just to be loved by you
# I wanna feel there's a reason for living again
# I want us to fly far away
# And I want my heart to sing the words only you can understand
# So put your hand in mine, say a prayer tonight
# So that we may find love
# I wanna be loved
# I want to be faithful and true
# I wanna be loved
# Ten million lifetimes with you baby
# I wanna be loved
# And after all I've been through
# I'll let my heart take its chances, just to be loved by you
# I want to be loved
# Faithful and true
# I want to be loved
# Ten billion lifetimes, ten zillion, ten trillion lifetimes baby
# And after all I've been through
# I'll let my heart take a chance just to be loved by you
# I'll let my heart take a chance just to be loved by you

# Somewhere in my memory
# An image fades from the year
# But still I see my love and me, together
# Her face washed away by the salt of my tears
# But I can feel so vivid still the love I felt for her
# Someone's lying by me but I'm all alone
# Soon she'll have to say good-bye
# Somewhere there's a heartbeat of the love of my own
# Everyday my heart beats with a prayer to find her
# Chorus:
# Take time to play around
# Same games it's up and down
# Can't wait till I've finally found
# A love of my own
# Take time to play the field
# Take a chance to spin the wheel
# Till I find something real
# A love of my own
# Flash back to my memory,
# because the picture's so clear
# The love high is so divine, there's
# nothing better
# Heaven is so far away, but she'll
# bring it right here
# And I believe that she can see my
# face in her fantasy
# No one here beside me she had to go
# So I'll start my search again
# Someday love will find me, when I don't know
# But from that day and there on,in her arms is where I'll be

# Lyrics Transcribed by Leonie's Team Member - Luvaprill00
# Ohhh.....sing to me...baby...oh...
# She was a poetry girl I adored
# Late at night I’d hear songs from her window
# Myrrh and frankincense seeped through her door
# And they lingered on...
# As her fingers caressed her guitar
# Felt like the strings of my heart she was strumming
# With her words we made love from afar
# As she sang her song...
# They were songs of change, joy and pain
# All the love she made (like she took the words from)
# Every dream I’d known, every love outgrown
# Singing on and on like she took the words from my heart
# (Like she took the words from my heart)
# And to the poetry girl down the hall
# Late at night I would answer her calling
# Like the lyrics from one of her songs
# She made love to me (makin love to me, yeah)
# Now our bodies and souls entertwined (so close)
# On the wings of passion we were soaring
# Then by the flickering candle at night
# She would sing to me... (yeah, yeah)
# They were songs of change (they were) joy and pain (oh yeah)
# All the love she made (mmm... like she took the words from)
# Every dream I’d known (my dreams) every love outgrown (and my loves)
# Singing on and on (ohhh) like she took the words from my heart
# Ooooooohhhhhh... ohhh.. baby..
# Love is often unkind when we fall
# For now my poetess sings to another
# But when I think of those nights down the hall
# From  somewhere deep inside
# I sing songs of change, joy and pain
# All the love I’ve made (and I take those words from)
# Every dream I’ve known, every love outgrown
# Singing on and on (and I take those words from)
# Songs of change, joy and pain
# All the love she made (like she took the words from)
# Every dream I’d known, every love outgrown
# Singing on and on (like she took the words from my heart)
> Eric Benet
# Heaven knows what you've been through
# So much pain
# Even though you can't see
# I'm not far away
# We always say if one of us
# Somehow went away
# We'd light a candle and say a prayer
# Know that love still remains
# Close your eyes, go to sleep
# Know my love is all around you
# Dream in peace, when you wake
# You will know I'm still with you
# Live your life from this day on
# And love again
# I know you'd do the same for me
# That's the way that loves is supposed to be
# Close your eyes, go to sleep
# Know my love is all around you
# Dream in peace, when you wake
# You will know I'm still with you
# When you feel those lonely teardrops
# Rolling down your face
# Just know my love watches over you
# Always, always
# Close your eyes, go to sleep
# Know my love is all around you
# Dream in peace, when you wake
# You will know I'm still with you
# I'm still with you
> Eric Benet
# Feel me, take me in slowly
# So you can understand how deep my love can go
# Baby your river is flowing
# So let me just fill you up 'till you just overflow
# Just feel me, all over your body
# I promise you'll thank me
# If you do just what you're told
# 'Cause, you will be whimpering gently
# Shivering softly but you won't be sad or cold
# 1 -     You know what that is
# That's just my way
# Whenever I like to take my time
# Whenever you can't believe the high
# Whenever I got you open wide
# That's just my way
# Whenever you feel the best you had
# Whatever your wish, it's my command
# When even your bad day ain't so bad
# That's just my way
# You know what that is (you know you know)
# That's just my way (that's just my way)
# Oh yeah completely I want you to know me
# Till of your fears and inhibitions are gone
# Now walk towards me, ever so slowly
# Now hike up that skirt and show me just where I belong
# Repeat 1
# I won't stop till the break of dawn
# That's what's really goin' on
# You can't do much better
# I'm down what you gonna do
# Baby now it's up to you
# Now I won't wait forever
# Girl that's just my way
# Repeat 1
> Eric Benet
# The first time I fell in love was long ago.
# I didn't know how to give my love at all.
# The next time I settled for what felt so close.
# But without romance, you're never gonna fall.
# After everything I've learned;
# Now it's finally my turn.
# This is the last time I'll fall... in love.
# The first time we walked under that starry sky,
# there was a moment when everything was clear.
# I didn't need to ask or even wonder why, because each question is answered when your near.
# and I'm wise enough to know when a miracle unfolds, this is the last time i'll fall in love.
# Now don't hold back, just let me know.
# Could i be moving much too fast or way too slow.
# 'Cause all of my life, I've waited for this day.
# To find that once in a lifetime, this is it, I'll never be the same.
# You'll never know what it's taken me to say these words.
# And now that I've said them, they could never be enough.
# As far as I can see, there's only you and only me.
# This is the last time I'll fall in love.
# Last time i'll fall in love.
# The last time i'll fall... in love.

# Hello baby how ya been, nice to see your face again
# Strange to see you comin' 'round, when you're the one who put me down
# We were such a happy pair, but then another man was there
# So forgive me I don't understand just what you want from me
# As you can see my life's been good, I moved the family out the
# neighborhood
# And all my dreams I've realized to think you said it was a waste of time
# It's never hard to make new friends when you'r making Benjamins
# Now did I hear you say again, You're still thinking of me?
# Chorus:
# Do you feel like dying, do you break down crying
# Do you fall down on your knees
# Don't want to go on living, does your world spinning
# When you think of me
# All I had was love to bring, But you was on some ol' material thing
# Looks like you're still trying to drive them mad, but it's not easy when
# you're credits bad
# I didn't know that I could feel so blue, It took some time but girl I'm
# over you
# Would've gladly gave my life for you, You should have thought the whole
# thing through
# All those nights with your girlfriends, Was just a front for you and him
# Y'all was s'posed to leave for Honolulu, leaving yo' ass was 'bout the
# best he could do
# Dry your tears now baby it's O.K., I'll introduce you to my fiancee
# Now tell me baby say again, you been thinking of me?
# Chorus
# Bridge:
# Do you think of me in waves that pull you under
# >From my memory is there nowhere you can hide
# Do you close your eyes, see my face and wonder
# How could a love so strong be nothing but a lies
# Chorus
> Eric Benet
# Oh
# Hey hey
# Hey
# La la la
# He, friend for all my life
# I would not deny
# Like brothers in my mind. She, treasure of his heart
# There upon his arm
# Eyes of midnight stars
# I've been tempted by forbidden love before
# But why must she be everythin
# That I've been praying for
# Now this burning in my heart will I ignore
# When I know that she'll be knocking at my door
# Chorus:
# Hey
# Why you messing with my feelings
# Why you follow me
# I can read the signs you're giving
# Why you follow me
# Turn away from your desire
# Why you follow me
# Don't be playing with this fire
# Why you follow me
# Now she's dancing in the night
# Her body is the moonlight
# Too much for me to fight
# Now I'm lost within her arms
# Careless with my heart
# I'm weakened by her charms
# He has looked me in my eyes a million times
# But now I turn away for I'm afraid
# Of what he'll find
# She's the precious love
# for whom his heart beats for
# But now she's always knocking at my door
# Chorus
> Eric bennet
# Now we've been friends girl for quite a while
# I've never been the kind for beggin' and pleadin'
# But I can tell by your hazy smile
# All if his lies you've been finding are heavy on your mind
# He broke your heartand he took your pride
# Will you ever love again?Though you try you don't believe it
# Come over here, talk to me a while
# Girl if you try youwould find that
# Someone like me,simple and free
# I could change your mind
# I'll love you in place's he couldn't find
# Girl don't you see for the chance I've been waiting
# For you to let me
# (Chorus)
# Love the hurt away (that's all I wanna do)
# Love the hurt away
# Verse 2:
# If you ever did, girl you need me know you need me now
# You dont need the complications of running to a stranger
# So I'm coming over and I'll stay awhile
# Taking my time till I find that sparkle in your smile
# Like a father's shoulder or a mother's arm
# Girl I've always been the one
# For strenght and understanding
# The rain will stp the clouds will be gone
# Girl if you tried you would find that
# You're someone like me,simple and free
# We're two of a kind
# I'll love you in ways no one has ever tried
# Girl don't you see for the chance I've been waiting
# For you to let me
# (Chorus)
# I've been there for you and you for me
# Better friend's we'll never find
# Nobody really knows you (knows you, knows you)
# No baby not the way I do (you kow it true oooh)
# We could miss an opportunity for what we've both been trying to find
# And girl it's tim I told you (told you told you)
# That all I ever really really wanted
# All I ever really wanted was to hold you
# Love the hurt away
# Until Fade

# When I was young    I never needed anyone

# My foundations were made of clay.
# As my soul slides down to die.
# How could I lose him?
# What did I try?
# Bit by bit, I've realized

# Once I lived the life of a millionaire,
# Spent all my money, I just did not care.
# Took all my friends out for a good time,
# Bought bootleg whisky, champagne and wine.
# Then I began to fall so low,
# Lost all my good friends, I did not have nowhere to go.
# I get my hands on a dollar again,
# I'm gonna hang on to it till that eagle grins.
# 'Cause no, no, nobody knows you
# When you're down and out.
# In your pocket, not one penny,
# And as for friends, you don't have any.
# When you finally get back up on your feet again,
# Everybody wants to be your old long-lost friend.
# Said it's mighty strange, without a doubt,
# Nobody knows you when you're down and out.
# When you finally get back upon your feet again,

# And how do I choose and where do I draw the line
# Between truth and necessary pain?
# And how do I know and where do I get my belief
# That things will be all right again?
# What words do I use to try and explain
# To those who have witnessed all my tears?
# And what does it mean to know all these things
# When love's been wasted all these years,
# When love's been wasted all these years.
# Standing in the shadows
# With my heart right in my hand,
# Removed from other people
# Who could never understand.
# I was a pilgrim for your love,
# A pilgrim for your love,
# A pilgrim for your love,
# I was a pilgrim for your love.
# It's like living in a nightmare,
# Like looking in the blackest hole,
# Like standing on the edge of nothing,
# Completly out of control.
# Now where have I been all these years
# And how come I just couldn't see?
# Like a blind man walking 'round in darkness,
# I was a pilgrim for your love,
# I was a pilgrim for your love.
# Standing in the shadows
# With my heart right in my hand,
# Removed from other people
# Who could never understand.

# It's three miles to the river
# That would carry me away,
# And two miles to the dusty street
# That I saw you on today.
# It's four miles to my lonely room
# Where I will hide my face,
# And about half a mile to the downtown bar
# That I ran from in disgrace.
# Lord, how long have I got to keep on running,
# Seven hours, seven days or seven years?
# All I know is, since you've been gone
# I feel like I'm drowning in a river,
# Drowning in a river of tears.
# Drowning in a river.
# Feel like I'm drowning,
# Drowning in a river.
# In three more days, I'll leave this town
# And disappear without a trace.
# A year from now, maybe settle down
# Where no one knows my face.
# I wish that I could hold you
# One more time to ease the pain,
# But my time's run out and I got to go,
# Got to run away again.
# Still I catch myself thinking,
# One day I'll find my way back here.
# You'll save me from drowning,
# Drowning in a river,
# Drowning in a river of tears.
# Drowning in a river.
# Feels like I'm drowning,
# Drowning in the river.
# Lord, how long must this go on?
# Drowning in a river,
# Drowning in a river of tears.

# I've looked into the heart of darkness
# Where the blood-red journey ends
# When you've faced the heart of darkness
# Even your soul begins to bend
# For a week I have been wating
# Still I am only in Saigon
# The walls move in a little closer
# I feel the jungle call me on
# Every minute I get weaker
# While in the jungle they grow strong
# What I wanted was a mission
# And for my sins they gave me one
# They brought it up just like room service
# 'Cause everyone gets what they want
# And when that mission was all over
# I'd never want another one
# I know, captain,
# That you've done this work before
# We've got a problem
# You can help us all I'm sure
# The colonel's gone rogue
# And his methods are unsound
# You'll take a PBR up river track him down
# There's a conflict in every human heart
# And the temptation is to take it all to far
# In this war things get so confused
# But there are some things
# Which cannot be excused
# He's acting like a God - an insane lunatic
# Your mission - exterminate
# With extreme prejudice
# The route is dangerous
# And your progress may be slow
# Here is the file and it's all you need to know
# Here I am the knife in my hand
# And now I understand why the genius must die
# Now I stand alone in the darkness
# With his blood upon my hands
# Where sat the warrior the poet
# Now lie the fragments of a man
# I've looked into the heart of darkness
# Where the blood-red journey ends
# When you've faced the heart of darkness
# Even your soul begins to bend

# When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side
# Give her all of your spare time, try to love and treat her right
# I mistreated my baby, but I can't see no reason why
# Anytime I think about it, I just wring my hands and cry
# Wonder, could I bear apologize, or would she sympathize with me
# Mmm, or would she sympathize with me
# She's a brownskin woman, just as sweet as a girlfriend can be
# Mmm, baby I may be right or wrong
# Baby, it your opinion, I may be right or wrong
# Watch your close friend, baby, then you enemies can't do you no harm
# When you got a good friend that will stay right by your side
# Give her all of your spare time, love and treat her right

# It's late in the evening
# She's wondering what clothes to wear
# She puts on her make up
# And brushes her long blonde hair
# And then she asks me
# Do I look alright
# And I say yes, you look wonderful tonight
# We go a party
# And everyone turns to see
# This beautiful lady
# That's walking around with me
# And then she asks me
# Do you feel alright
# And I say yes, I feel wonderful tonight
# I feel wonderful
# Because I see the love light in your eyes
# And the wonder of it all
# Is that you just don't realize
# How much I love you
# It's time to go home now
# And I've got an aching head
# So I give her the car keys
# She helps me to bed
# And then I tell her
# As I turn out the light
# I say my darling, you were wonderful tonight
# Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight

# We're stuck in our ways
# And nothin' seems to ever change
# But the sun is shinin', seems like perfect timin'
# To take a drive with the music loud
# Laugh and sing 'til the road runs out
# But the sun is shinin', and there's no denyin'
# That you and I could give it one more try
# But it sure feels like a good day for goodbye
# We swore if we tried we could make it to the weekend
# By Saturday night when we started sinkin'
# Who's gonna bail us out this time when the water gets too high
# And not enough talk, not enough action
# We could fill our days with yet another distraction
# But my hands are getting numb these days from barely hangin' on
# But the sun is shinin', seems like perfect timin'
# To take a drive with the music loud
# Laugh and sing 'til the road runs out
# But the sun is shinin', and there's no denyin'
# That you and I could give it one more try
# But it sure feels like a good day for goodbye
# To pack my bags, collect my things, take back what's mine
# Cut these strings, baby, baby, don't you really maybe think it's time

# Laugh and sing 'til the road runs out
# But the sun is shinin', and there's no denyin'

# If we were made in his image then call us by our names
# Most intellects do not believe in god but they fear us just the same
# Oh on and on and on and on
# On and on and on and on
# I go on and on and on and on
# On and on and on and on
# I am feeling kinda hungry  'cause my high is coming down
# Don't feed me yours  'cause your food does not endure
# I think i need a cup of tea, the world keeps burnin'
# Oh what a day, what a day what a day
# You rush into destruction  'cause you don't have nothin' left
# The mothership can't save you so your ass is goin' get it
# If we were made in his image then call us by our names
# Most intellects do not believe in god but they fear us just the same
# Oh on and on and on and on

# Ye yo, ye yo, ye yo, ye yo
# (Help me)
# Ye yo, ye yo, ye yo, ye yo...
# Sometimes,
# Sometimes I get so lonely, lonely, lonely
# I feel all by myself up here
# That’s when I take a minute
# To re-evaluate things
# All of the things I think are special
# Oooh like
# When you wake up in the morning
# And you see the morning sun
# And you need to know the world is on your side
# Who do you run to
# Who can you turn to
# Come on
# Then the evening comes to greet you
# You need someone to hold you close
# And you feel you need to rest your aching mind
# Who can you run to
# Who can you turn to
# Well see the sun’s in the east and the moon reflects
# Like the knowledge and wisdom, I manifest
# If you wanna go to heaven lay up on my breast
# I’m ye yo, you’re ye yo
# I say the sun’s in the east and the moon reflects
# Like the knowledge and wisdom, I manifest
# If you wanna go to heaven lay up on my breast
# I’m ye yo, you’re ye yo
# Ye yo, ye yo, ye yo.....

# Niggaz ain't loyal to the game
# That's why the dope game is so fucked up now
# Punk motherfuckers
# [Verse One]
# 30 birds, 30 birds all I want is 30 birds
# I'm never catchin cases, stead I'm clockin 3rd
# I got 36 ounces, thousand grams of scams
# anything over 500 is life so damn
# I'm goin for broke, I ain't no joke when I flip flop
# niggaz want static, automatically the clip pops
# born into this life with no escape from playa hates
# down to stack papes, goin pyscho like Norman Bates
# amphetamines, the dope fiends, I stacks greens
# damn, niggaz tryin to stick for my cream
# my lifes turned upside down, don't fuck around
# bustin bullets for stacks, so dead bodies is found
# on a mission for money, shit seems funny to me
# nigga try to take my birds and set 'em free
# now how can this be, I heard he caught a federal case
# caught with more dope in his crib than scarface
# talkin to federalizes from Detroit to Cali
# nigga tryin to catch me slippin like silly Sally
# I dumped his body in the alley, and shot 'em a close range
# nigga wasn't loyal to the game, so I popped his ass
# [Chorus 2X]
# 30 birds, 30 birds got no loyalty, 30 birds flew away
# from me, them dirty birds
# [Verse Two]
# I got away as clean as a whistle, another 187 on my pistol
# visions of my burial, got make another move 20 birds to go
# life ain't nuthin but money, so I make snow
# sometime it get slow, I get paranoid
# jail and hell is 2 things that I can't avoid
# mama always saw certain shit I couldn't see
# its hard for me to see gone of v.s.o.p.
# a deal is deal, plus I'm tryin to make a meal
# feelin bad a nigga had to kill, just to stay real
# it started out small time, big time, and no time
# crime is my life, and my life is crime
# I'm sick of seeing dope fiends, and burned down blocks
# hearin screams, and 17 shots from hot glocks
# back in the days, I used to roll down to crack spots
# now I watch niggaz cry, right before they die
# niggaz be snitchin, you cookin keys in your kitchen
# buried a half a mill, in my backyard steel
# through all the excitement, federal indictment
# now I'm on the run, with 10 birds and a gun
# and even if I get caught they only know my name
# I ain't tellin no shit, cause I be loyal to this game
# [Chorus 2X]
# [Verse Three]
# I went to ten fuckin states, dropped of ten birds
# 1996, January, the 3rd, I was in a Detroit motel with a trick
# thinkin bout goin out like Maserati Rick, our the Chambers family, Y.B.I
# 200 keys stole, like redbird and I, from all the shit I did, growin up as a kid
# now they got my ass facing a lifetime bid, I'm on the run from the law
# runnin out of time, goin out my mind, from my life of crime
# seems I must a been slippin, didn't catch the setup
# bullets flying through the window, and my bitch got wet up
# seems I had to get my pay like Demetrius Holloway
# down at the broadway, from the AK spray
# as my heart stop beating all I was hoping, was not to
# die with my eyes open

# (Paper....Gotta have that Paper...)
# (Paper....Gotta have that Paper...)
# (Paper....)
# [Verse 1]
# Gotta get that feddy cuz I need it, that's why I stay heated
# Jesus save me, throw me down a bundle
# Wrapped up like a football, bet I won't fumble
# Stumble, I'm lying in the jungle, serving my "Bo-Jumbles"
# A killer where my gun blows, but I stay humble
# Watch 'em all crumble, "Baller" like "Motumbo"
# Riding with a bumble, beats causing rumble
# Hoes try to beat a nigga like a bongo
# Mixerman cook 'em in a pot like gumbo
# Specially when your pesos coming so pronto
# [Verse 2]
# Gotta get some purple is what I'm smoking, that' why I stay choking, locc'n
# English broken, all this papers got me open
# Get more papers all I'm hoping
# No need to say a word to papers, spoken
# Freezer frozen when I'm posing
# Passion, cameras, flashing lights and action main attraction
# Paper make everything better best believe it, and I love to receive it
# Billionaire baller status, the chief is still breathing
# [Verse 3]
# Gotta have that mucho de nero, and when I got it its to querdo
# Errday, allday, baby girl what you say I can't stay
# We can play I don't pay, keep me right around the way
# We can ride around the today, AaaaYo. HeeeyHo
# Wake up get ya cake up...bake up
# Only thing that matters in this life is paper, everybody got they own price for paper
# Chips with the dip grims when ya get more paper then ya even know what to do with
# So let me get right to it
# [Outo: Kid Talking]
# Dadda we gotta get all the paper
# That's right
# So we can have that lure jet
# And we can be on MTV Cribs with the mansion and the swimming pool

# You go tell Uncle Sam "No war in Afghanistan"
# Or Iraq, or Iran, many people dying man
# Shots go off in Bethleham even in Jerusalem
# Christians killing Mus-a-lims
# Tell me what you doing man?
# We caught up in the struggle, sit back watch the water bubble
# Lock us up for drugs you smuggle, Detroit hustlers paying double
# Now the whole country's in trouble, gas prices sky high
# People scared to fly on planes; why Aaliyah have to die?
# Terrorized, civilized, people livin evil lives
# You can see it in their eyes, fire falling from the skies
# Nowhere to run and hide, everybody's gonna die
# You can duct tape all your windows but the smell is still inside
# We were up there eight months
# We were living in the desert drinking hot-ass water
# one hundred and forty degree weather
# wondering whether we were going to live or die, day to day, man
# It was real stressful over there
# So, anyway, I had this boy, right?
# His name was Rennisson
# Basicly what happened with him is:
# he got out of the army before the Gulf War kicked off
# and uhh.. you know everybody thought he was safe, but he joined the reserves
# Next thing we know, we hear he's right over there with us but in another unit
# So, you know, we're like
# "Aw hell yeah, Rennisson's here too, man. I hope he's alright."
# Next thing we know BAM! He's fucking dead, man
# The scud missiles came and took him and his boys out
# Next thing you know, we're all trippin like "Oh shit!"
# That's when it struck us, man
# This shit is for real
# We can die at any time, man

# When susnanah cries  she cries a rainstorm
# She cries a river  she cries a hole in the ground
# She cries for love she cries a sad song
# She cries a shiver sometimes she creis for me too
# And I say I'll never hurt her but she knows it isn't true
# 'cos although I never told her
# I think she knows 'bout me and you
# Now she cries with silent tension this can't be right
# And the downtown special cries along
# 'cos I'm leaving tonight.
# When susnanah cries she cries a rainstorm
# She cries a river  she cries a hole in the ground
# She cries for love she cries a sad song
# She cries a shiver sometimes she creis for me too
# Now I slip the night around her  and I hope she'll be okay
# I just pray someone will find her  and guide her on her way
# 'cos I'm leaving on the 1 am and by soon I'm out of sight
# But she'll always be my baby though I'm leaving tonight
# Every night I hear her talking in her sleep
# She says "you know I'll always be there"
# And I feel like such a creep
# Please take back the love she gave to me
# And in time her grief may pass just tell her that I loved her
# Now it's all she has when susannah cries...

# She knew this love would break her heart
# But rebellion always turned her on
# She liked the dangerous type, pullin' stick up heists.
# Waitin' for him to come around so they could be alone
# And she would sayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦
# Bad Boy Clyde, you know you drive me wild
# Put away your gun, why don't you play with me?
# Rollin' with your boys, you're always on the run
# For just this once, why can't you stay with me?
# She had a gut feeling, call it intuition
# Wishing that it would subside
# It's just a day like any other, there's no need to cause a fight
# He has to go, his boys are counting on him, you know
# Oh my myÃ¢â‚¬Â¦
# Bad Boy Clyde, you know you drive me wild
# Put away your gun, why don't you play with me?
# Rollin' with your boys, you're always on the run
# For just this once, why can't you stay with me?
# Thinkin' about, thinkin' about the life that we have
# You're always on the run (you were always running around)
# Thinkin' about what you take for granted
# And if you cared about yourself, you'd let go baby
# (The cycle never ends)

# I don't wanna write another love song
# I don't wanna open up my eyes
# I don't wanna see what you have done to me
# I don't wanna know what's under your disguise
# And I don't need to see what's on the inside
# Let me enjoy this cause it was all just a beautiful lie
# I just wanna keep on believing every little thing you ever said to me
# All was true, and I want to be sure you adore me too
# I don't wanna know when it ended for you
# I want to be able to sleep at night
# I want to hold my head up high
# I want to feel like you were always mine
# But it was all just a beautiful lie
# It was all just a wonderful terrible wonderful...
# Why'd you give all of your love, just to take it all away?
# can't breathe
# I need you to lie to me
# I want to be able to sleep at night
# I want to hold my head up high
# I want to feel like you were always mine
# But it was all just a beautiful, terrible, wonderful, horrible, beautiful lie
# And it's so easy to believe

# Indifference (yeah, yeah), you gave it all to me
# And now it is clear to see that
# You have no intention of ever coming back to me
# Never is so soon, and I will miss you
# How does it find me only when I'm needy, only when I'm lonely?
# (How does it find me?)
# How does it search out, what are the signals?
# Why do I give off such thunderous signals?
# Why do I give in, why do I give up?
# I am a reject of love
# And where are my friends now, where are my friends now?
# Where is my lover now?
# Blanket me in you
# Cover me in gold and blue
# Reason need not follow you
# Blanket me in you
# I can still smell you on me
# In how long will you go from here?
# Because I want, I want to love you
# And if I gather all my sorrow
# Would you still love me tomorrow?
# (It won't be so bad)
# I could make your sickness end
# I once had my fortune read
# 'You won't be so sad' he said
# I wonder if it's true
# Blanket me in you
# Cover me in gold and blue

# I met him on sunday
# I loved him by tuesday afternoon.
# Woke up on friday
# And changed my whole life to make some room.
# Around a quarter to two I have remembered all my lines
# that melody I love'
# And it goes: La da da da da..da da da
# Hopped on the metro and I make my way home
# but I can't get him out of my mind
# No matter just how hard I try
# And if the rumours are true
# then I can look forward to some better days and getaways..... so nice
# Cause when I am with you
# You're the crescendo to that melody that melody I love
# We'll have better days and getaways cause everyday is a holiday with you
# You've gotta let me know
# I gotta know for sure
# Don't leave me out in the cold
# I've gotta know for sure
# lalalalalalalala....
# When I think of you
# I see better days and getaways cause everyday is a holiday with you.

# This is so torturous, I know that I shouldn't, but I can not resist
# Just what is it that you are weaving that's keeping my body from leaving?

# Strong as an earthquake, bright as a shinin' star

# Battling, battling, these feelings are traveling
# Quicker than a flick of lightning, you were tightening
# Round my heart and won't slow down

# Why would you stay if its killing us both just to be here?
# There's no more room to grow and you wont find yourself 'till you leave me.
# It's a beautiful world outside these walls,

# and its blinding you...so
# G'on....get away.....leave me be
# 'cause I dont wanna see your face around here.

# 'go away'
# instead of ' baby please stay just one more day'
# I barely have the strength to leave you
# and you don't wanna be with me
# So go on (just get gone)
# and leave me alone...
# cee-lo: that isn't true
# girl, how could you say what you not mean?
# oh we used to have such a hot thing
# and I just cant go anywhere and be not seen
# but for the love of you theres places I have stopped being
# and don't make me start about all the sweets and all the shopping
# I mean God I even went out and got a ring
# And its no cliche
# Love is blind its in you Literally- stop seeing
# But when you truly love someone, girl, you wouldn't be shamed
# And if I did not see you there, girl, I wouldn't have came
# You must have some strong shoulders 'cause thats where you be putting the blame

# And there's nothin' they can do
# Now the night is fallin' before they eyes
# Still no one's comin' through, callin'

# As we stepped out Blinkbonny Fair.
# And if my waiting prove in vain,
# Then I will pack and track ever take me.
# The long road will ease my pain.
# No jewel of mankind would ever make me
# Whisper love's words again.
# For in drink I'll seek good company,
# My ears will ring with the tavern's laughter,

# And I miss my loved ones so
# In the early morning rain
# With no place to go
# Out on runway number 9
# Big 77 set to go
# But I'm stuck here on the ground
# Where the cold winds blow
# Your can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train
# So I best be on my way in the early morning rain
# Hear her mighty engines roar
# See the silver bird on high
# She's away and westward bound far above my home she'll fly
# Where the morning rain don't fall
# And the sun always shines
# She'll be flying past my home
# In about 3 hours time
# Chorus

# It's Sunday morning
# I can feel the side effects
# You shake out your body
# And you wake up what's left
# I spent too much money last night
# I had too much to drink
# Spending too much time with myself
# And I don't know what to think
# Any love that's easy
# Falls down like rain
# Any love that's easy
# Goes out with a bad name
# Any love that you find on Easy Street
# Can only be a dream
# Any love that you find on Easy Street
# Can only be a dream
# It was only for pleasure
# Our love took a back seat
# My heart went crazy
# And my whole life skipped a beat
# Swallow these emotions down
# To kill the aftertaste
# Starin' into the future now
# I can only see your face
# Any love that's easy
# Falls down like rain
# Any love that's easy
# Goes out with a bad name
# Any love that you find on Easy Street
# Can only be a dream
# Any love that you find on Easy Street
# Can only be a dream
# Oooh, only a dreamĂ¢â‚¬Â¦.

# Never know how much I love you, you never know how much I care
# When you put your arms around me, I get a feeling that I just can't bear
# You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
# Fever in the morning, fever all through the night.
# Bless my soul I love you, take this heart away
# Take these arms I never use them
# And just believe what my lips have to say
# You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
# Fever in the morning, fever all through the night
# Listen to me baby, hear every word I say
# No one can love you the way I do
# Because they don't know how to love you my way
# You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
# Fever in the morning, fever all through the night
# The sun lights up the daytime, the moon lights up at night
# My eyes light up when you call my name,
# Because I know you're gonna treat me right
# You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
# Fever in the morning, fever all through the night.

# And remembering some pain
# See there once was a boy
# And on the street he'd surely die
# But the nightbird took him in
# And she taught him how to fly
# See the nightbird softly fly
# Why does she fly alone?
# Is the moonlight just a flame for her memory?
# Now she's gone
# Two bit bars and honky tonks
# Any pleasure can be found
# You can get just what you want
# If you lay your money down
# And loney sailors do their drinking
# My, my, my how the brave men do die
# And the nightbird sells her pleasures
# Bringing tears to my eyes
# See the nightbird softly fly
# Why does she fly alone
# Is the moonlight just a flame for her memory
# Now she's gone
# So I guess I'll go out walking
# Lord, let the rain keep falling down

# turn to silvery bells,
# then will my love
# return to me.
# When roses grow,
# in the wintery snow,
# then will my love
# return to me.
# Oh, Waly Waly,
# love be bonnie,
# and bright as a jewel
# when it's first new.
# But love grows old,
# and waxes cold,
# and fades away
# like morning dew.
# There is a ship,
# it's sailing the sea,
# it's loaded high
# and deep can be.
# But not so deep,
# as my love for him,
# I know not if
# I sink or swim.
# Oh, Waly Waly,

# Across the evening sky,all the birds are leaving
# Oh but then you know, it was time for them to go
# By the winter fire, I will still be dreaming
# I do not count the time
# for who knows where the time goes?
# Who knows where the time goes?
# Sad,deserted shore
# your fickle friends are leaving
# oh, but then you know it was time for them to go
# But I will still be here
# I have no thought of leaving
# I do not count the time
# for who knows where the time goes?
# I know I'm not alone
# while my love is near me
# I know that its so until its time to go
# All the storms in Winter and the birds in Spring again

# I came upon a child of God
# He was walking along the road
# And I asked him "Tell me where are you going?”
# This he told me
# Said "I'm going down to Yasgur's farm
# Gonna join in a rock and roll band
# Got to get back to the land
# And get my soul free”
# We are stardust, we’re golden
# And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
# Can I walk along beside you
# I have come here to lose the smog
# And I feel like I’m a part
# Of something turning round and round
# And maybe it’s the time of year
# Maybe it's the time of man
# And I don't know who I am
# But life is for learning ...
# We are stardust, we’re golden
# And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
# By the time we got to Woodstock
# We were half a million strong
# And everywhere was the song
# And the celebration
# And I dreamed I saw the bomber jet planes
# ******FIRING SHOT INTO THE SKY******
# Turning into butterflies
# Above our nation ...
# We are stardust, we’re golden
# And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

# Oh yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.

# You watch my love grow like a child,
# Sometimes gentle and sometimes wild,
# Sometimes you just take my breath away.
# And it’s too good to slip by,
# Too good too lose,
# Too good to be there just to use.
# I’m gonna stand up on a mountain top,
# And tell the views
# That you take my breath away.

# She'll only come out at night
# The lean and hungry type
# Nothing is new, I've seen her here before
# Watching and waiting
# She's sitting with you but her eyes are on the door
# So many have paid to see
# What you think you're getting for free
# The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
# Money's the matter
# If you're in it for love you ain't gonna get too far
# Oh here she comes
# Watch out boy she'll chew you up
# Oh here she comes
# She's a maneater
# Oh here she comes
# Watch out boy she'll chew you up
# Oh here she comes
# She's a maneater
# I wouldn't if I were you
# I know what she can do
# She's deadly man, and she could really rip your world apart
# Mind over matter
# The beauty is there but a beast is in the heart
# Oh here she comes
# Watch out boy she'll chew you up
# Oh here she comes

# The words have been drained from this pencil
# Sweet words that I want to give you
# And I cant sleep, I need to tell you... goodnight
# When we're together I fell perfect
# When I'm pulled away from you I fall apart
# All that you say is sacred to me
# Your eyes are so blue, I can't look away as we lay in the stillness
# You whisper to me, Lady, marry me, promise you'll stay with me
# Oh you don't have to ask me, you know you're all that I live for
# You know I'd die just to hold you, stay with you
# Somehow I'll show you that you are my night sky
# I've always been right behind you
# Now I'll always be right beside you
# So many nights I've cried myself to sleep
# Now that you love me I love myself
# I never thought I would say that
# I never thought there'd be you

# I can't see your star.
# I can't see your star.
# Though I patiently waited, bedside, for the death of today.
# I can't see your star.
# The mechanical lights of Lisbon frightened it away.
# And I'm alone now,
# Me and all I stood for.
# We're wandering now.
# All in parts and pieces, swim lonely, find your own way out.
# I can't see your star.
# I can't see your star.
# How can the darkness feel so wrong?
# And I'm alone now,
# Me and all I stood for.
# We're wandering now.
# All in parts and pieces, swim lonely, find your own way out.
# So far away.
# It's growing colder without your love.
# Why can't you feel me calling your name?
# Can't break the silence,
# It's breaking me.
# All my fears turn to rage.
# And I'm alone now, me
# And all I stood for.
# We're wandering now.
# All in parts and pieces, swim lonely, find your own way out.
# Now, I have nothing worth fighting for.

# I'll let you start again, but you won't
# I saw you pray for change and then you walked all over me
# You wanted what you could not have and now you are alone
# Cos they're still in you too low
# All the voices you don't know
# And they're still in you too low
# All the choices that you chose
# Make the voices tell me who you are, and who I am to be
# Are you alone where you are tonight?
# I'm alone when you're right here
# But I'm still in you somehow
# I never left at all
# Now I'm still in you too low
# So my voice is all you know
# Cos they're still in you too low
# All the voices you don't know
# And they're still in you too low
# All the choices that you chose
# Leave you nothing left to hold
# When you're nothing it's a good time to remind you of one thing
# The pursuit begins when this portrayal of life, ends

# Hold your hands into the sky
# Pray for mercy, instead of time
# Big cities' action of my big city girl
# Think she builds her own heaven
# Cause she finds it's a lonesome world
# Filled with dirty street cars and dirty signs
# I hope there comes a time when
# I get to see your dirty mind
# Hold your hands into the sky
# Pray for mercy, instead of time
# Low budget movies, change our low budget lives
# Theres something to corsets and horror that joins our lonesome minds
# And these bloody faces with their bloody knives
# Say if we ever make it
# We'll be so bloody tired (of these times)
# Hold your hands into the sky
# Pray for mercy, instead of time
# You are the massacre, the masochist, the tease
# And you're captivating , standing in front of me
# Is the reason, I'm still wondering why everyone we loved has broke away
# Hold your hands into the sky
# Pray for mercy, instead of time
# You are the massacre, the masochist, the tease
# And you're captivating, standing in front of me
# Hold your hand into the sky
# Pray for mercy, instead of time
# So be my massacre, be my masochist, be my tease
# Cause you captivate me when you stand in front of me

# My time is priceless, so if you iceless, babygirl gotta go

# Now for every real dog
# There's that bitch that's behind him
# That bitch that when that nigga get to missin'
# She gon' find him
# Old girl gonna stay with the dog
# Hand in hand with the dog
# And whatever the fuck went down she ran with the dog
# First time I had a match and didn't scratch
# You catch just loss half you niggas, but the punk can fetch
# And I know my babygirl is gonna stretch
# Any rappin' motherfucker, male or female
# Place your bets
# You can imagine what the bloodline is like
# Since I love mine to fight
# I'm on some shit like what time tonight
# Y'all niggaz can't be for real
# Cause any one of you faggots
# Will catch a face full of lead
# Bitch you shouldn't be faggots
# Fuckin' maggots, once you have it, as good as I got it
# I know my hands is in my pockets
# But Eve got you spotted, red dotted
# Eve didn't before the Dog
# Nothin' but a war with tha bark
# Always been the bitch that could roll with a thug and
# Wipe up the blood
# Roll in the mud with your other ducks nigga what?
# What you need when the chips is down
# I'll abide on the stand when evidence is found
# I give pound to ya niggaz they respect this bitch
# I spit rounds at your enemy no less than six
# Always keep the extra clip Dog taught me well
# The extra eyes on your team I see who's next to fail
# Always hold your back up, I picked it up when you slack up
# And if attention gets to close I tell the world to back up
# Biting two time, rhymes who ride?
# Bitch and your livin' lessons through life
# Fuckin' with the dog he's a master
# Plus he's gonna show me how to blast ya
# Want attention then pass ya
# Split you then stash you

# Get em girl, ha-ha, that's my baby
# I'mma put the bitch down, cause the boy got rabies
# All my pups is crazy, cause off the leash
# They can eat, stand and match defeat, out of the least
# And if the beast is in the big one
# The beast is in the little ones
# Talkin' 'bout let's hit him son
# Fuckin' with the little guns
# Y'all niggaz had a little run
# What more do you want?
# For your fans you can front
# But the dog is on the hunt
# You know I'm at the door point fox rippin' 'em out
# And you're the only one that can tame me
# When I'm flippin em out
# Bite's lethal, no recovering

# This bitch gon always hold you down
# Keep the cowards thinking twice

# And he's fast, to blast, a cat, that he think he on the prowl,

# Always be his extra back bone, quick to let you cats know,
# Always by his side, Eve, the apple of his eye,
# Us together ain't no stoppin, snatchin pieces of the pie,
# Us together in our own world, whats his becomes mine,
# Exceed eternity with him, we'll stand the test of time

# Went from dancing on tabletops to making labels pop
# For the love of the money so I could cop
# Everything from icy rings to drop tops and now I'm on top
# But to look back on my reality happy I stopped
# Letting niggas ruin my world impressed by niggas trying to school this Baby
# girl I was fucking too early
# 15 knowing money was green
# Puffing too early, body big, not grown knowledged up and too early
# Thought it was cute to flirt with older kats up in they face
# Didn't have a daddy so I put a daddy in his place
# My mami was my shelter but I broke free
# Learning that the streets was harder that I thought they'd be
# Wanting to be grown, rebeling
# Ain't no telling what I'd be pussy selling (huh) never would I
# Instead I wore a g-string
# Thought never could I
# Thought I had to, to be grown beginning of my life, but
# Heaven only knows

# Heaven only knows
# Heaven only knows
# (Heaven only knows)

# Yo, close myself down
# Held myself in
# Explode by myself alone no one helping
# What am I to do but cry alone at night
# No one in the house knew tv is my life
# Who was I to tell and what would they think of me
# No one understood the pain that was sent to me
# Broke down from the things men would say to me
# Selling drinks to a nieve kid
# I blame me
# But I really never had someone tell me what to do

# Hey, yo I don’t even know you and I hate you
# See all I know is that my girlfriend used to date you
# How would you feel if she held you down and raped you?
# Tried and tried, but she never could escape you
# She was in love and I’d ask her how? I mean why?
# What kind of love from a nigga would black your eye?
# What kind of love from a nigga every night make you cry?
# What kind of love from a nigga make you wish he would die?
# I mean shit he bought you things and gave you diamond rings
# But them things wasn’t worth none of the pain that he brings
# And you stayed, what made you fall for him?
# That nigga had the power to make you crawl for him
# I thought you was a doctor be on call for him
# Smacked you down cause he said you was too tall for him, huh?
# That wasn’t love, babygirl you was dreamin’
# I could have killed you when you said your seed was growin’ from his semen
# 1 - Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
# What you think is love, is truly not
# You need to elevate and find
# Repeat 1
# I don’t even know you and I’d kill you myself
# You played with her like a doll and put her back on the shelf
# Wouldn’t let her go to school and better herself
# She had a baby by your ass and you ain’t giving no help
# Uh-huh big time hustler, snake motherfucker
# One’s born everyday and everyday she was your sucker
# How could you beat the mother of your children?
# How could you tell her that you lover her?
# Don’t give a fuck if she lives
# She told me she would leave you, I admit it she did
# But came back, made up a lie about you missing your kids
# Sweet kisses, baby didn’t even know she was your mistress
# Had to deal with fist fights and phone calls from your bitches
# Floss like you possess her, tellin’ me to mind my business
# Said that it was her life and stay the fuck out of it
# I tried and said just for him I’ll keep a ready clip
# Repeat 1 (2x)
# I don’t even know you and I want you dead
# Don’t know the facts but I saw the blood pour from her head
# See I laid down beside her in the hospital bed
# And about two hours later, doctors said she was dead
# Had the nerve to show up at her mother’s house the next day
# To come and pay your respects and help the family pray
# Even knelt down on one knee and let a tear drop
# And before you had a chance to get up
# You heard my gun cock
# Prayin’ to me now, I ain’t God but I’ll pretend
# I ain’t start your life but nigga I’mma bring it to an end
# And I did, clear shots and no regrets
# ‘Member cops comin’ in, watch me going to jail
# Nigga whatever my bitch, fuck it my sister
# You could never figure out even if I let you live
# What our love was all about
# I considered her my blood and it don’t come no thicker
# Repeat 1 till end

# And we ain't goin' nowhere 'till we lock the game
# But in the mean time ball while we live the dream
# And now I need to hear y'all sing

# See y'all don't understand us you know
# Ruff Ryderz is a family
# Ruff Ryderz....Ruff Ryderz...Ruff Ryderz
# Lets go...Swizz Beatz
# This is the darkest shit, sparkest shit
# Hittin wit the hardest shit, cuz before we started shit
# Wit kidz I knew my fuckin friendz all turned against me
# Said fuck it, bought me a dog ever since me and my dog has been like this
# He got my back I got his, schemin on mad niggaz
# Dats how we do bidz
# It's about time to start another, robbin spree
# Cuz yo, my way is highway, robbery
# When I was up north since 16  I was sendin niggaz home in a coffin
# Livin like a orphan, you bad nigga?
# I'll be back to see if you'll be still here
# You know my style will put yo fuckin man, in a wheelchair
# He'll never walk again, on the strength of me
# Dats how I left him G, scared to death of me
# Niggaz cannot run, hit wit da hot one
# From the shotgun, catz was close wondered how we got done...
# Yo yo, E-V-E
# My dogz believe in me
# Petty thugz hide yo cake, never teasin me
# I show love to, all my bitches hustlin one'z, tussle wit these
# Makin moves, second to none, I locked it, huh
# Made a sudden move you got bit
# Flooded wit the double R, real street shit
# Da blond hair bandit, you got gunz, hand it
# Turn my face when I bust a cannon
# Cuz I don't wear sunblock
# Ask Drag if the fire is hot (Flame On baby)
# Shit pop shellz, fall three feet, roll over and stop
# We warn niggaz that we comin, then we total the block
# We scorn niggaz like they mothers, then we wet up they socks
# Red dot, excapin on a radar, to seashore, then hide out
# And buy out bars till we see far
# In this game, we beat y'all, you got money?
# Keep y'alls, for us be tearin tryin to hide, then tear out fire
# Beat y'alls
# And you can come see me if you tryin to
# Get some gramz for the night
# Cuz I can get it for you raw, gray, tan or white
# Fuck rap yo, I'd rather be plannin the flights
# Somewhere hot on a wave runner, tanning wit dykes
# Blowin the haze, while all of em givin me brains
# One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line
# But everybody wanna contact me, and get wit me
# And still end up bein mad cuz I charge 50
# And as for you suckaz, you can keep those rapz
# And screw yo awardz, my son can't eat those plaques
# I never was shipped but some thingz I never forget
# Like if you spent three you garanteed to make back six
# Drove the Benz off the lot and just dusted her off
# Tints, rims, stashed, tick the governer off
# Even the catz that be hatin still be lovin the dogz
# Cuz they know that the double R's comin for war
# Wha
# You ain't ready to die, then why should you live?
# Cuz when I start bustin the gunz you hidin the kids
# And the Pieer's still ridin wit clips, survivin wit bricks
# We beefin on the 4th you got to die on the 5th
# Like I wasnt hustlin dope or robbin the blocks
# Starvin or not, carvin the cheek, palmin the glock
# I figure which nigga could I watch wit a watch
# I like to knock off my crack then I pull off a heist
# Put it together, double it twice this shit is my life
# Catch me wit a .45, hot pair of Nikes
# And three red dice, like, give me the bank or gimmie yo face
# Gimmie a shank It's Holiday(Uh)
# The hooptie's in the front but the truck is a mile away
# Niggaz wanna ride tommorow when they'll probabaly die today
# Cuz da Pio'll hollow the gunz
# Then holla at son (I feel you nigga)
# And when he go to holla back, niggaz swallowin one
# Y'all dem bust in them crowd niggaz and hit whoever
# When you should aim for them niggaz that took yo leather
# They right there, but you scared that they gon bust
# Cause they crazy, but crazy niggaz bleed like us
# See I'm one shot thru the heart like Cupid
# Y'all niggaz might be crazy, but y'all not stupid
# It's 99, I'm killin you, woman and kid
# Fuck Scarface, watch me, I'm mo action to see
# Than the muthafuckaz that y'all see on T.V.
# And fuck what you heard, check how Sheek get down
# Comes the gun, shit, I'm rhymin wit one on me now
# You neva know, what clown could walk in the studio
# Talkin shit, and there's gon be more than the amps that blow
# I'll pour gas on yo skin and watch yo shit detach
# Wit a book of matches, now dats when you met yo match
# And the worst thing for you is for me to have a gun when I'm thirsty
# I'll turn niggaz more Holy Man, than Eddie Murphy
# And I deal wit mo bricks than that city do in Jersey
# I got call cops niggaz
# I got autops niggaz, that'll bust you and slide
# Wit some of 6-drop niggaz
# Revolver Pop niggaz, easy Ox niggaz, get knocked
# Say I smoked detox niggaz
# Drug program, hit the streetz and cop 56 mo gramz
# Y'all niggaz ain't fuckin wit the fam and dats word
# Hey yo boy, whats the difference between fire and water?
# You whether drown or die off torture, cause yo skins of ya
# And watch ya burn off fat, dog I'm off the thermostat
# Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo bitch a perm wit that
# Keep shellz in the envelopes cuz I'll mail out bullets
# More blood that a riot on a jailhouse footage
# Buck 40, got a extra 20 wit the semi, when it hit you
# You gon do a 360 pretty swiftly
# When I burn you to a crisp you gon be crunchier than chips
# Wit my hand all up in the bag, munchin on this shit
# Bit by bit, clip by clip and every block by block is brick on brick
# So I got knots on knots, got thingz that'll pop yo top
# And double R spot yo block wit 16 shots and watch y'all drop
# And ain't nobody gettin up, lest they in the wheelchair
# Sittin up or spittin up, either way I don't give a fuck

# (The chorus is drowned out and in the back round)
# (Chorus)  (x2)
# [Eve (DMX)]
# Get that ass up and Scream Double R (What!)
# We ain't going nowhere we made it this far(Uh -1st time come on - 2nd)

# Time to hit y'all cats with another joint from Eve and the dog
# And you know how we do baby creep in the fog
# Now hold it down for the fellas, hold it down for the girls
# Keep motherfuckers knowing this rap shit is our world (WHAT!)
# Been there and done that (UH), had fun where the run at (UH)
# Don't got to shoot a motherfucker no more so put the gun back (UH)
# Pay niggas to do that, cause they a lot better at it
# Keep the burner in the truck cause well you got to have it (aight)
# It's an unwritten law (uh huh)

# Hit 'em with four (uh) hairline to the jaw (WHAT!)

# Always here for you when somebody else is not (uh)
# A dog and his bitch blowing up the spot
# Come on
# (Chorus sounding regular)
# (Chorus)  (x2)
# It should be against the law, me and the dog like a brawl
# And the only thing that can help you is God and you should call on him
# Weak sight, the streets like, creep like
# Cause they got each other's she bark and he bite
# It ain't strange you cats know the name
# Double R bubble hard it's a shame
# Realest niggas doing it, them clowns they ruin it
# Shut 'em down give 'em pounds cause palms go glue in it
# Sticky finger niggas steal each other's style
# Claiming how they started things not original
# Cats they get caught up in the glitter and glam
# If that's the case you should be considered a fan
# I'm like tired of the same beats that claim streets
# Doing nothing but ducking from the hood got the same speech
# Only one you feeling is you niggas know the deal
# Industry, fuck it, in the streets keep it real, nigga
# (Chorus)  (x2)
# Since the beginning we both knew we was winning
# Cause we been in all type of shit (uh) but kept on spitting, hitting
# Niggas in the head with that shit that let 'em know it was the truth
# So they feel that cause it's real black (WHAT!)
# We never going to stop (uh), no matter what they say (uh)
# No matter what they do (uh) they'll never take it away (Come On)
# What the Lord give you let no man curse
# E-V-E and DMX from the birth to the earth
# Why they sick cause we still close thought that it was over
# Cats trying to tear us apart dogs got closer
# All the shit we deal with only make us stronger
# Try to do a lot of shit but they can't belong to
# For real niggas scared us, steady catching them bluffing
# What you say shut up nigga saying much of nothing
# Act like they don't want it but they demand it
# Double R keep it hard and niggas can't stand it
# (Chorus)  (x3)
> Eve
# Yo Eve, where you at man
# I'm tires of talkin' to this answering machine shit
# I seen you earlier but you know
# You was with them Ruff Ryder niggas
# I ain't really fuckin with it like that shit
# Yo, yo nigga if you shy move on
# Only room for a thug that can hold on
# Keep me right in the night, early in the morn
# I need a dog that can buy it if the pressure's on
# Damn I hate it when I find out that you niggas soft
# Go run and hide for cover when the trouble starts
# I like it when he stay and play his part
# Ain't scared to put a slug through a nigga's heart
# Takes the best of both worlds don't discriminate
# East coast, West Coast I don't playa hate
# Platinum daytan on the 6-4 regulator
# Big trucks in the hood, black Navigator
# If you icy with the price, bring me that ring pa
# Might entice me to play nicely and come and get'cha
# You got a wifey, tell her nicely I'm in the picture
# Cause I ain't gon struggle for long and try to get'cha
# Come on Eve why you talking crazy and all stuck up
# Why you stay tryin to play me like yo ass is tough one

# Like I ain't got it and forget that
# Bratty type spoiled by the best black Caddy
# Escalated '99 edition get that
# And what you ain't equal to a shwang and I ain't with that
# Not impressed by all of this is mine but we can split that
# Give me all of it homebody this ain't no Kit Kat
# Start me off with time couple weeks and I could flip that
# What's this 50/50?
# You ain't breakin' off none, ya stash is limited
# I see it insufficient funds

# Want me, dick's be harder then aluminum bat's
# Flaunt me, I don't hang around with average cats
# With average whips, that spend average stacks
# I'm into anything but normal things
# Celly rings from tha broker at the stock exchange I'm hearing that
# Glacier filled chains all the haters starin' at me
# Make sure I stay nice keep ya bitches glaring at
# Wave ya Rollies in the air, yea last year
# Now I'm searching for the platinum iced out Cartier
# Laid up in da cuts in silk Dolce underwear
# Yeah baby spend that that's all I'm tryin to hear
# It's funny how I used to want the richest niggas
# Keep five on deck to see who get the quickest figures
# Cause I only want the pick of the litter for this one
# And now because my papers got bigger you gets none
# Come on Eve why you talking crazy and all stuck up
# Why you stay tryin to play me like yo ass is tough one
# My own fuckin money ain't good enough
# You got a nigga so sick I'm bout to throw the fuck up
# But I love ya (come on ma)

# We never shared secrets
# We wasn't fucking raw
# Helped you when you were down and now you got the fucking gawl
# We used to be so tight
# We was each others life
# You was my husband and no doubt I was your fucking wife
# Did anything you ever asked of Eve
# You turned out to be a devil nigga I couldn't believe
# Sneaking numbers out my phone
# Calling bitches on the cell
# What the hell!
# Clunky bitches one on the scale
# I'm like a dime over line
# You can't calculate my status
# And you fucking with these bitches like my ass wasn't the fattest
# Like I didn't dress the baddest
# Any time we surface
# Must have been insecure
# Niggas made you nervous
# And I guess it was your purpose to lock me in
# But you fucked up
# Your lucks out
# But then again
# You had me, You lost me

# You fucked around and played around

# Used to let shit slide
# Caught a couple lies
# I chilled for real, I mean I called a couple guys
# Knew when you was fucking up, I saw it in your eyes
# Then I guess it was my fault cause I put up the disguise
# In public we was happy
# In home we'd be scrapping
# Later we'd be naked, joking, smoking and laughing
# Making up to Break up
# I thought that shit was love
# But it wasn't and I learned the hard was soaking in suds
# Crying all depressed
# Not again You'll never catch me
# Wishing on a star for some nigga to come bless me
# I tried to save it
# All you ever did was stress me
# Pushing all me buttons
# Why the fuck must you stress me
# Nigga get a life
# Go on and find a wife
# Get the fuck out my face ‘fore I go and find a knife
# And you still calling my phone trying to act polite
# Asking me for favors now you know that shit ain't right
# But
# You had me, You lost me
# And now you want me back
# You fucked around and played around
# And now your feeling sad
# You had me, You lost me
# And now you want me back
# You fucked around and played around
# And now your feeling sad
# Uh-oh
# You see me coming don't you
# Look at you running wont you
# Oh you gonna sit there and see me like I want to approach you
# Now it's payback
# I'm talking way back
# To bitches calling hanging up
# You ain't no way to save that
# To unanswered questions
# To home in the a.m.
# To you out clubbing
# Forcing me to stay in
# Remember - O.K. then
# It's over - no playing
# I said it before
# I'm about to do it - fuck what you saying
# To late for apologies
# Go puff on a pile of weed
# Think about this good bitch that's leaving and don't follow me
# Moving on
# Shut you down
# Now you wanna regret
# You could fuck all day - But it would never feel like my sex
# Played yourself
# Tried to show I cared
# You ain't cared
# When I needed you the most nigga you wasn't there
# And the game is the same
# Comes around goes around
# Now hate me forever while the chorus goes around
# You had me, You lost me
# And now you want me back
# You fucked around and played around
# And now your feeling sad
# You had me, You lost me
# And now you want me back
# You fucked around and played around
# And now your feeling sad
# You had me, You lost me
# And now you want me back
# You fucked around and played around
# And now your feeling sad
# You had me, You lost me
# And now you want me back
# You fucked around and played around
# And now your feeling sad
# Look ma everybody makes mistakes aight

# baby, baby
# (get at the party, city of venis)
# (eve)
# i did it to myself, couldn't help the way I felt about him
# sick when he wasn't there, like I never delt without him
# played the fool by choice, all I had was this man
# letem have the best of both worlds cause it was his clan
# all the things I wanted to hear, he told me gently
# whatever it was, wanted nuthin, gave me plenty
# told me that he split with this chick but couldn't shake her
# cause she had his kids, so he fed her with this paper
# first it started off like that, dough for closure
# started slackin off, in fact it wasn't over
# now my world is crumblin down, I'm fealin shake-e
# used to be a superwoman, no bitch could replace me
# wanted him to leave me alone, but I was caught up
# thought I was strong, broke down, when braking up was brought up
# tried to really ryde with this dude I thought I loved him
# and every time I asked what I should do, he said trust him
# (chorus 2)
# you, me, and she
# what we gonna do
# baby,(trust me) baby(hold me, yeaaa)
# you, me, and she
# what we gonna do
# baby (believe me), baby (need me, yeaaa)
# (eve)
# to hate, I must be crazy, feeding hI'm the bullshit
# attitudes and tryin to hold out that shit was useless
# the more I tried to back up, the more he kept comin
# lie after lie, shit, lieing wasn't nuthin
# tear after tear come down, tellin me to be cool
# all I need is you baby, nobody could be you
# believed him, he decieved me, just to keep me
# callin me from her spots, sayin how he need me
# i had to step back, he got me stressed out
# this aint what I planned, thought I had my life sketched out
# huh, I guess not, love me to hurt me
# hurt me to make-up, then make-up to desert me
# (chorus 2)
# (eve)
# back and forth with the he said, he said got me dizzy
# if I leave, know the routine, he beg cause he miss me
# too late, cause you had me, lost me, daddy move on
# boss-bitch, no more floss, nigga I'm gone
# arguements for hours me and her comparing notes and
# after all the screamin stop, we comparing quotes
# you got sloppy thoughts, you was that nigga let me catch you
# heart didn't hurt till I covered up your tattoo
# my statue, on a pedestal, every breath too
# never new the worst till you felt what the best do
# and I'm that, its over now, hope I stressed you
# But Niggas only do it when you lie, when I let you..

# The underworld element beckoned in a dream to
# Find a sidekick pronto I should
# Think Thelma not Daria
# So I search hard and near and far for
# Someone the description called for
# Thought seldom not Daria
# Found her in a suburban wasteland
# Swaddling clothed and caked in beach sand
# At first sight thought that I might turn and
# Run out of fear and intrigue
# I stood numb kind of military
# I'd found her I'd keep her
# Safe and sound
# Don't make a sound
# Look up at the sky shit's going down
# I heard a bang and stars collided
# Her skin drew me in just like a magnet
# Little girl my little world is yours
# I took a one way highway headed West heaven bound
# Never even thought once to turn round
# Real life plays tricks on the brain
# Pointed fingers were left in the dust and The ones who doubted rusted
# We're out of here like Vladimir
# Now I'm looking at a picture where I'm right beside you
# Eyes shine with a light that binds you
# To this fool with Super Glue
# From all the way across the nation
# You came with just your name and
# Your suitcase I'll keep you
# Safe and sound
# Don't make a sound
# Look up at the sky shit's going down
# I heard a bang and stars collided
# Her skin drew me in just like a magnet
# Little girl my little world is yours
# Big bang little girl run away with me
# And be my Thelma & Louise
# Brush that sand off your ask
# Your questions later love me long time

# I took a ride to meet an enemy
# October light shown bright through the windshield
# Right into my eyes where I was silent riding shotgun
# Chewing on some sugar free gum
# Parallel park and pay the meter
# If I die before I leave tell her I'll never leave her
# I am fine just a little broken up
# OK my nerves have never been so shot
# Can't get this shit off my mind
# I just want to be alright
# So just tell me nothing's wrong
# Then get undressed and spend the night
# The autumn sun burning logic in my brain
# I'm asking why there is pleasure when there's pain
# I'm here to pay for my mistakes in a humiliating manner
# If there is a next time I'll cover up
# I feel alone I feel shaky and uncertain
# A kind man shakes my hand and draws the curtain
# In a word he saves my life and then I exit out the enter door and smile
# Can't get this shit off my mind
# I just want to be alright
# So just tell me nothing's wrong
# Then get undressed and spend the night
# I took a ride to meet an enemy
# I faced a fear of mine and shivered but didn't blink
# I took a ride to meet an enemy to end all the madness
# And now I know that I'll be fine
# I am fine
# Can't get this shit off my mind
# I just want to be alright
# So just tell me nothing's wrong
# Then get undressed and spend the night
# Just want to be fine

# Sitting up once again...In my bedroom
# Shaking hand holds ugly head...In my bedroom
# Wish I may wish I might...In my bedroom
# Have this wish I wish tonight...In my bedroom
# Chorus:
# At night when you turn out the light, think of me, smile and feel all right
# And when you lay your head down to sleep, may I be the one who fills your dreams...
# Are you lying wide awake?...In your bedroom
# Are you trying to fall asleep?...In your bedroom
# Cuz your not thinking about me...In your bedroom
# If you were you'd wish those thoughts would leave you...In your bedroom

# At night when you turn out the light, you wonder what it was you thought you liked.
# And you ask yourself what did you see, In an idle hollow fool like me
# I'm not the one who fills my dreams.......

# It said "Fok Karina" on the wall we were leaning
# I get a feeling and she starts to grin
# Adjusted my pants as my face turns to red
# Foresight is so often blind
# Just take the 2 to the 134
# But first take the elevator to my floor
# It's good to be bad if it's better than bored
# Foresight is so often blind
# Slur to a favorite rhyme
# Girl eyes tend to hypnotize
# The trance is so divine
# Decide to be the reason why
# I stay another night
# Vodkareening through the hotel door
# Guilty is really a choice and a chore
# It's good to be bad if it's better than bored
# Foresight is so often blind
# Slur to a favorite rhyme and that's when
# Girl eyes tend to hypnotize
# The trance is so divine
# Decide to be the reason why
# I stay another night
# I took her hand and then an aspirin in the morning
# I took her hand and took her home
# It said "Fok Karina" on the wall we were leaning on
# Afraid of a common phenomenon again

# Had a two room condo back in a wealthy section
# Of the Florida flatlands where she had me kept in
# A wicked trance for a day
# Well I kind of sort of knew what was going to happen
# When she and a friend came and met me in Atlanta
# I professed my love in an animalistic manner

# That she'd come to rescue me
# Well I kind of sort of saw the sirens coming
# She was running toward me wearing almost nothing
# And my heart beat skipped when she bent down at the hip
# And her lips pressed against mine
# Like Jessica Rabbit she collects bad habits gets her drinks for free

# Yeah, that's where I first kissed you
# A modern day romance
# A perfect performance
# Acting like two fools
# Saying silly things
# Whisper sweet nothings
# Live young lovers only do
# I was shaking
# You were breathtaking
# Like the Empire State
# My voice was so far
# Not quite Sinatra
# Singing songs so great
# The clock struck one
# The night still very young
# In the city that never sleeps
# Then a whirlwind blew
# When I first kissed you
# nearly swept me
# Swept me off my feet
# When I first kissed you
# That's when I knew
# I was in love
# Because up there
# Yeah, that's where
# I first kissed you
> Extreme
# I remember it well
# I was just about three
# My dad said
# "Son what do you want to be?"
# It didn't ring no bells but I said
# "Daddy I'm a bit too young what do you want from me?"
# I'm much older now
# I'm almost a man
# I can do anything, you bet I can
# Raise a family
# Now wouldn't that be grand
# So sorry but I got bigger plans
# You can be anything in the world today
# Something like a preacher, a teacher
# A baseball player
# Those kind of things I just don't care
# I want to represent the USA
# The American Dream
# As far as the eye I say can you see
# I want to be
# I want to be the leader of the country
# When I'm President
# Things will be different
# We'll start a new government
# When I'm President
# When I'm President
# You can be in my cabinet
# I'll be your heaven sent
# President
# First things first we're gonna change the rules
# Better listen up all you boys and girls
# Your president says there'll be no after school
# So vote for me wouldn't that be cool
# Yeah! Yeah!
# Now I know there's trouble in the Middle East
# I'll spend all the money when I stop the Arms Race
# All my brothers in the desert
# Gonna have themselves a feast
# When that's done then we'll start on world peace
# So go ask Alice
# Cos you know what he said
# What did he say?
# Remember, "I wanna be elected"
> Extreme
# I've got something
# That you ought to know
# Don't even know
# Whether to come or go
# Up down
# Head's spinning around
# Wind up in
# The lost and found
# Wind me up, Wind me up
# Wind me up, Wind me up
# Wind me up, Wind me up
# Tell me why
# You make it so hard
# All I ask is
# Finish what you start
# Wind me up, Wind me up
# Wind me up, Wind me up
# Wind me up, Wind me up
# Wind me up that's
# All you do
# Wind me up and
# Leave me blue
# I'd like to see if
# You could be
# Kind enough to me
# When you
# Wind me up
# Don't take me places
# Then wanna go home
# Sometimes, I think
# I'm better off alone
# Hey girl, you know
# What you do
# Color me red
# Then leave me blue

# Lyrics Transcribed by Leonie's Team Member - Marelena
# When you walked away
# I laid awake all through the night incase you called
# Wondering why and trying
# Hard to analyze If whatever I had done I could undo
# And the beauty of it all
# Was that the only one I needed then was you
# Talking me through
# How unforseen it was
# Only a dream it was
# Only a dream
# When you walked away
# I laid awake all through the night just to recall
# Tossing and turning trying
# Hard to realize why the color of your eyes
# Could make me so blue
# And the beauty of it all
# Was that the shadows on the wall
# Were painting you being untrue
# How unforseen it was
# Only a dream it was
# Only a dream
# Would it be tonight or seem to be undignified
# If I said don't turn away till I
# Find a place to hide where I can watch it all collide
# Before my whole world falls down
# And the beauty of it all
# Is that the writing on the wall's not getting through
# I never knew how unforseen it was
# What might have been it was
# Only a dream it was
# Only a dream
# How unforseen it was
# Only a dream

# (Clear) I can see for miles
# (Clear) I can be myself
# (Clear) I can sit in place
# (Clear) I'm not part of this race
# (Clear) I'm not in this alone
# (Clear) I got freedom to roam
# (Clear) I can sit in my place
# (Clear) I withdraw from the race
# [Verse 1]
# Excuse me, but there's so much here for you to touch
# And there's I can do to make you give a fuck
# Sometimes everything ain't enough
# When the eyes are tired from wearing the tyrant's handcuffs
# If I was content I wouldn't need to stand up
# Why am I living if I can't love
# I want to scream at the top of my bleeding lungs
# Never meant to break your trust
# Just wanted to wake you up
# Once before I left in this personal surface to clarity
# Either they're scared of me or laughing hysterically
# I'm just a parody of something that apparently
# Was never properly prepared to bleed
# Oh how do I wish that I'd never learned to cry
# When your only reply is waving your hands from side-to-side
# I am lost cause I'm my own tour guide
# And if I ever talk to myself I'll probably tell lies
# So for now I sit in this disfigured toadstool
# Showing the face of a child that only smiles cause he's told to
# Sometimes they look to me for the answers and I don't know what to do
# I'm usually just as confused as you
# (Clear) I can see for miles
# (Clear) I can be myself
# (Clear) I can sit in place
# (Clear) I'm not part of this race
# (Clear) I'm not in this alone
# (Clear) I got freedom to roam
# (Clear) I can sit in my place
# (Clear) I withdraw from the race
# [Verse 1]
# The chord sprung a leak
# The mind was filled with cork crumbs
# Caressed my baby's cheek it died of boredom
# It's not a clear day until the war is done
# And I'm no longer haunted by the bullet hole
# I put in the head of a porcelain clown found porch bum
# Reciting my spells biting the nail off my sore thumb
# Leaving for good I knew that when the door swung
# I don't believe that I could stay even if I wanted to
# My brain ain't gray sky or water proof
# So by tomorrow I'll be a robot again
# The thought of the clouds coming in makes me cringe
# But I've been in the storm, submerged in the distortion
# For most of my days spent following this course in
# I'm learning to love the moment that's rolling
# Instead of openly viewing time as my opponent
# So I'm always...
# Wait, wait, wait, wait!
# Here let me cut this shit man
# It's a nice day
# Fuck sitting here and writing
# I'm going for a walk...
> Eyedea
# I just want a send a special, special thank you today
# Anyone who donated a little of something in the collection can
# God won't forget you
# Now this next song is a song about writing this song
# Now I'm not some profound visionary
# But this specific incision didn't particularly take too long
# I was just running up this back stage stairs
# And suddenly it dawned to me
# What a good idea, true inspiration
# But with no pen or paper to record the creation
# I aborted the plans of grand innovation
# And stood bored pacing on the wood floor waiting for more wars to
# Gore for my planning and
# Maybe I'm not cut out for this writing game
# I thought for a brief second
# But then it was like the lightning hit through me in a complete head spin
# And kept punching me with raising concepts rhyme patterns and song interruptions
# With long floods that dropped fire struck until I was finally finished
# And in a matter of minutes consciousness is linked with being inventive infinite
# And one of my friends happened to have a pen
# So I wrote it all down on my hand
# That was that
# Thank you
# We're just gonna
# Thank you thank you
# We're just gonna pass the collection around one more time
# Try to find it in your pockets and your hearts to donate all your money
# God won't forget you
> Eyedea
# [Verse 1]
# Sometimes it's best to give up the fight
# All that really matters is I know that I'm right
# I can't be following anyone else's ideal path of success
# I pass up that stress, feel mad for the rest, gasping for breath
# Trapped in my head, asking for less rations in death, passion is left
# Ashes to dust...
# Just consider the love of an antique pot on my window sill
# My mask is my flesh my dream is to grow wings
# And sing 'til freedom rings
# I got a rhythm but I'm eager to unplug my speaker
# And let my heart be my teacher
# It's hard to tell where all this comes from
# It's like my soul holds a song that eternity left undone
# But it'll never be finished
# That's the point
# I got to get going
# Thanks for the inspiration
# I'm walking
# Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
# I'm walking
# Walking until I find myself
# Sometimes, how close we get
# From the way it gets
# I run towards the rainbow
# But when I get there it's gone
# So next time there's a rainbow
# I'm a run away from it
# So when I turn around
# I'll see it while it's strong
# [Verse 2]
# Now I don't care about my whereabouts
# I'll clear it out, I got to go that's all I know
# I'll hit the road and find my soul in the sin
# They say there is no maybe please don't doubt
# Conceive what you can be, infinite
# That everything and anything anyway
# I see your eyes and realize I need to cry
# That you and I it's hard to hide
# What's being lied so deep inside
# Thanks for your help
# But I won't find nothing better
# In a world this beautiful
# I'll be walking forever
# I'm walking
# Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
# I'm walking
# Walking until I find myself
# [Verse 3]
# Journey I don't expect nothing
# But the un-expectable
# The only thing I know for a fact
# Is that I'll never know too much about myself
# So I'm a keep learning
# Cause I'm determined to find the pieces fire-burning
# Turning these pages just as slow as I can
# Reading every single word from the poet within
# I float with the wind and stay content
# Wherever it carries me
# There was no beginning and there won't be an end
# I'm just a piece of the galaxy
# A seed in the soil
# A stream of consciousness
# And to the seasons I'm loyal
# Don't take my movement personal
# It's not that I don't dig you
# But I can't be on the beach
# Of your sea when it boils
# And so I walk with the music
# Because to me that's all that's real
# Don't know where I'm going
# Don't have a plan
# I've been hearing instructions my whole life
# And I still think walking away from the rainbow
# Will make you more of a man
# I'm walking
# Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
# I'm walking
# Walking until I find myself
# Speaking of walking, as I walked onto the set
# The director was like, what the fuck you doing!
# Glanced around and said, my fault I'm in the wrong movie
> Eyedea & Abilities
# Sometimes gunfire's brighter than the sunshine
# Sometimes a child's scream influences every dream
# Sometimes we fool ourselves into thinkin' we've moved on
# But no way, no how, do we ever forget what we've seen
# No way, no how, do we ever forget what we've seen
# No way, no how, do we ever forget what we've seen
# No way, no how, do we ever forget what we've seen
# No way, no how, do we ever forget what we've seen
# It's now twenty-five years later, he's on the brink of fourty-three
# Still searchin' for sanity, surveyin' the floor of his distorted sea
# He remembers high-school friends jokin' about the war
# Never knew what Mom was cryin' for
# The other piece that shines in his mind
# Is the divine first-love soul-mate beauty brown-eyed queen he left behind
# He remembers holdin' her tight, watchin' the sunset at shore
# Never knew what she was cryin' for
# He got the letter in his mail by the middle of his summer
# Wouldn't have had to go if it wasn't for his new born brother
# He was barely eighteen, murdering people even younger
# And he still ducks and covers every time he hears the thunder
# He still hears the screams, smells the flesh, tastes the death
# Sees the blood, feels the pain What's to gain?
# Nothing's left but the slug that remains in his right path
# The bullet laughs every time he cries, and it drives him mad
# Trying to sleep, but the visions give him a cold sweat
# The war's been over for two decades, but he still hasn't been home yet
# Everyday he wakes and strains to repress his guilt
# And forget the horror, the violence, the kill-or-be-killed
# Fists are always clenched, teeth are always grindin'
# Real life is lost, and in a bottle he tries to find it
# "It's not fair", he mumbles through a nightmare
# Only in the fight for two years, and wound up spendin' his whole life there
# He was face to face with the devil for the "welfare" of his country
# Now he's strainin' to live, but his conscience won't let him
# It ain't flashbacks, you have to understand the tragedy, see
# He left the war, but the war never left him, see
# He left the war, but the war never left him, see
# He left the war, but the war never left him, see
# He left the war, but the war never left him, see
# He left the war
# It's now twenty-five years later, he's on the edge of a park bench
# He's asked God for help, but found his source non-existent
# He sits in the shadows, 'cause his sun burns no more
# Now he knows what Mom was cryin' for
# I used to watch old man in the park, the sight slowly drove right
# through my heart
# Wishin' I could help, but not knowin' where to start
# I'd walk away, curse the world, gush some love, and curse some more
# Now you know who I've been cryin' for
# He threw his medals in the river, but they sunk alone
# Put shades on his eyes, to hide him from the war zone in the sky
# He tried to slit his wrists about a month ago
# But he's seen so much death, he's scared to life of suicide
# If there was some way to break him out of this penitentiary
# Gulps get bigger and figures it'll chase away his memories
# But the dreams only worsen, the scenes almost burst in
# He recalls how training took away his right to be a person
# Put a gun in his hand, left him to die with the land
# The plan was the murder of man
# Politicians have a dispute, decide to send in troops
# But the truth is, they just don't understand
# Now he's runnin' out of time, and runnin' out of energy
# But till the last day, he'll be fighting for the murder of his memories
# And although he never got rid of his dog-tags
# He still wishes they'd have sent his parents and american flag (instead of him)
# He was face to face with the devil for the "welfare" of his country
# Now he's strainin' to live, but his conscience won't let him
# It ain't flashbacks, you have to understand the tragedy, see
# He left the war, but the war never left him, see
# He left the war, but the war never left him, see
# He left the war, but the war never left him, see
# He left the war, but the war never left him, see
# He left the war
# Sometimes gunfire's brighter than the sunshine
# Sometimes a child's scream influences every dream
# Sometimes we fool ourselves into thinkin' we've moved on
# But no way, no how, do we ever forget what we've seen
# No way, no how, do we ever forget what we've seen
# No way, no how, do we ever forget what we've seen
# No way, no how, do we ever forget what we've seen

# Ayo, Abilities man *Yo what up?*
# Yo, I got somethin' I gotta get off my chest right quick

# Now back to the subject, to me not givin' a damn about you
# This is my world, it just so happens that you live in it too
# But that don't mean I gotta tolerate your talk
# There's a thousand other people in this room
# that'd probably love to hear your thoughts
# But while your uncomfortably ridin' my tip
# Abilities is upstairs stealin' your shit
# You want props, stop runnin' your mouth
# Just give a pound, buy a CD, and be out
# Yo, you need to take a few steps back
# Your DJ can't scratch and your emcee can't rap

# Man you stupid motherfuckers need to learn how to act
# "Ayo, ain't that that Eyedea kid, talkin' all that crazy
# Man I'm 'bout to hyperbolate this fool, you can't see me!"
# Ever since we started winnin' battles and travelin' 'cross the land
# Fools think if they could beat you they could beat you and
# They wanna test so they step not knowin Eyedea's rep to leave 'em swept
# Up off they feet, the contest always ends like this:
# -Your cheap flimsy chump style ain't worth the ground it'll get buried beneath
# -The beats are buckin' your weak, flowin' your flow is scared of the beat(?)
# -Princess, the king's here so play the background
# -How's that sound? You just got clowned now sit your ass down
# Man these kids get on my nerves, but I can't pretend I hate 'em
# Cause whack emcees are such a great source of entertainment
# Me and Abilities watched the Blaze Battles for like a year:
# "This kid out there, got nothin' to do"
# Heh, it's funny, sometime's kids is so whack with the rappin
# Instead of actually rappin' back I just wind up laughin' like
# haha haha haha ha haha ha haha ha ha ha*
# Yo, you need to take a couple steps back
# Your partner can't scratch, and your cousin can't rap
# You all up in my face and we just came here to max
# Man you stupid motherfuckers need to learn how to act
# "Oh my God, Eyedea & Abilities, you guys are soo phat!
# My boyfriend loves you guys soo much
# You know what? Oh my God, you should sign my tits
# Oh great, this is gonna be perfect!"
# You know we love to see y'all at the shows
# But this is dedicated to the ones someone might call a *ho*
# All I gotta do is wink to get you back to my hotel
# I can't respect a person that don't respect themselves
# You're that one girl I went to highschool with
# Back then you treated me like I wasn't shit
# You say if I give you a free CD you'll show me your tits?
# You get the CD for ten bucks like everyone else you stupid *bi-yotch*
# I don't care if you just broke up with your boyfriend *No*
# I ain't tryin' to go where every other rapper's been *No*
# If I was to kick all my boys would clown so I could
# Never hold you, can't hold you, won't hold you down*
# Look all you gotta do is learn some manners
# Women and men, DJs and rappers
# There's nothin' more to say, this meeting is ajourned

# I'm gonna run from the voice of reason 'till it turns to laughter
# Against the masquerade like I don't believe in the morning after
# the chronicles contain a few hidden chapters
# Which keep our mirrors dirty, in case vanity backfires
# a cold grin curtains hunger pains and eagerness
# in one throw you could expose up my weaknesses
# I'm putty in your hands kept my ways buried'in sand
# until you learn to look through a window no one else can
# oh charity, clarity, honesty excitement
# the one with class, falsely accused, misconstrued
# anger, sorrow, pact, machinary, decisions
# collisions, instant gratification
# thinking about you programed to destruct obstacles
# What don't kill me, will just me crazier
# I'm so filthy, sorry I had to see me like this
# I sold you a lie that showed through my eyes
# It told you to cry a stained glass suicide
# They slowly chiseled down the walls we all hide behind
# It's only time before your secrets become weakened headlines
# But I'll be fine, suffocating on my own mask
# I just wish I could forget how to read between the cracks
# perceptive, unethical, digested tunnel vision
# methadone, real diamond cut tested
# resurrected perfected by well respected professionals
# head doctor, head hunter, scratched the surface
# lost somewhere, accepted own ability transparent open, curves...?
# [repeat 2X]
# I'm living in a world made of windows and mirrors
# This is safeguard covered crystallized tears
# giving out different images, same fears
# One day it's all gonna shatter, and I hope you're right here...
# see through my anxieties and insecurities rip out my insides
# put 'em on display, encaged, enraged and break the bottle
# that I've become, I run I jump I grow completely shattered fractured, captured
# glad I had the chance to be so helpless
# see through my 4 corner widow pane so plain and simple
# brain is crippled walking through a maze
# when did I decide to be an object to reflecet cruicified for my imperfections
# I answered every question peeling the tint off of my confession
# close your eyes if we can
# death to pride, lets begin
# I'm glass and its a dream
# and I don't miss a thing
# broken mirrors don't bring back nothing
# cherish image, how do I look any given day
# you can't kill me if you rebuild me

# (You're slipping)
# (You know what I'm saying?)
# I'll repeat the name for you
# (E-A, E-A)
# (You punk motherfuckers!)
> Eyedea & Abilities
# Ay one two... (Yo we're recordin'...yo, come up on the mic a little bit)
# Check, check check (a'ight)
# Ayo, yo yeah bring in them keys real quick though
# You know what I'm talkin about, yeeah
# Eyedea and Abilities in the house, two-thousand and three
# Bringin' you that DJ..MC...just some good hip hop music
# Yo, you ready to get into this? (yeah)
# Well drop that beat then...
# Ladies and Gentlemen (EA, EA)
# Ladies and Gentlemen (EA)
# [Verse 1]
# We bringin' it back to basics, situated under the basement
# The nation is guaranteed to hit the pavement
# You slept now you're bobbin' your head
# So hard your left with a permanent injury to your neck
# The turn of the century's way behind
# We raped the time and she gave birth to the First Born drafted this design
# What? You thought our second record wouldn't be live? Suprise!
# Why'd it take you so long realize only the strong survive?
# Without the need for compromise, no one's above us, in context
# Your whole genre's elevator music playin' on the way up to where my songs sit
# [Verse 2]
# You sold a lot of records, but I got a question
# How many endin' up back in the used section... all of 'em
# Yeah Abilities' beats bang
# but he ain't makin' nothin' for you, so stop callin' him
# I had enough of these pretty punk emcee/DJ duos
# pseudo-boy bands holdin' hands in public
# Your candy-coated condom-flavored karaoke cover songs
# Are no longer accepted so I suggest you exit *back*
# Back on a mission to corrupt human brain waves
# Unconcerned with circumstantial turbulence, we learn to aim straight
# With every endin' there comes a new beginnin'
# Listen we got to clue you in on just what you've been missin'
