# Words & Music by YOSHIKI
# I'm walking in the rain
# Yuku atemonaku kizutsuita karadanurashi
# Karamitsuku koori no zawameki
# Koroshitsuzukete samayou itsumademo
# Until I can forget your love
# Nemuri wa mayaku
# Tohou ni kureta kokoro wo shizuka ni tokasu
# Maiagaru ai wo odorasate
# Furueru karada wo kioku no bara ni tsutsumu
# I keep my love for you to myself
# Endless rain, fall on my heart kokoro no kizu ni
# Let me forget all of the hate, all of the sadness
# "Days of joy, days of sadness slowly pass me by
# As I try to hold you, you are vanishing before me
# You're just an illusion
# When I'm awaken, my tears have dried in the sand of sleep
# I'm a rose blooming in the desert"
# It's a dream, I'm in love with you
# Madoromi dakishimete
# Repeat
# I awake from my dream
# I can't find my way without you
# The dream is over
# Koe ni naranai kotoba wo kurikaeshitemo
# Takasugiru haiiro no kabe wa
# Sugisatta hi no omoi wo yume ni utsusu
# Until I can forget your love
# Repeat
# Endless rain, let me stay
# evermore in your heart
# Let my heart take in your tears,
# take in your memories

# I believed
# If time passes, everything turns into beauty
# If the rain stop, tears clean the scars

# Everything starts weaning fresh colors
# Every sound beginds playing
# a heartfelt melody
# Jealousy embelishes a page of epic
# Desire is embraced in a dream
# But my mind is still in chaos and..... "

# I've beeeeen this way and I can't stop (ah)
# Hands on the ball and I won't drop (no)
# Half-assed rhymes that you can't watch (no)
# It ain't cause I want to it's cause I got-ta
# Get it Crip while the gettin is good
# before the game is 10% skill and 90% Hollywood
# I don't need that, I don't believe that
# E'rybody gon' get hurt, if I do dirt
# I flirt with the idea of quittin' the game
# Nah!!  I'ma evolve continue to change
# It take brains, balls and backbones to get it on
# and keep it on, we keepin it movin, to each his own
# So I spit about it, whatever I feel about it
# I'm just bein real about it; X get hot nigga forget about it
# Speech don't failllll me now
# Dedicated to the enemies and friends that hold me down
# [Chorus: Nate Dogg]
# (We) back on line (We) came to ride
# (We) deal (We) stack (We) multiply
# (We) stay on the grind (Until) we die
# And back for mo', cause we can't get enough
# Above the rest, accept no less
# Go ahead, check the game, be my guest
# Somethin brand new and heavy to get off my chest
# Win time after time 'til there ain't none left
# Hardhat, punch the clock, back to work
# I'm bigger, stronger, faster, built to hurt
# everybody and anybody who come to my party
# like they ready to get roudy and touch somebody
# Who's that nigga y'all came to see? "X!"
# Often imitated, but cannot be, "X!"
# What's next, collect respect like paychecks
# Straight to the bank with my bitch and have safe sex
# What do you believe in?  I believe in
# seizin the moment, livin and dyin to spit with a vengeance
# Here for redemption - been around forever
# Y'all cats were just too blind to listen
# [Nate Dogg]
# It ain't my fault.. we keep droppin hits
# And you can't spit like this, so I'm takin yo' bitch
# It ain't shit changed.. we gon' bang like this
# And I'm drinkin this fifth, we still don't take no shit
# I got a "Sixth Sense," that tells me you ain't worth six cents
# I'm sick with my sixth sense
# Whattup Doc?  I'm gettin down to business
# Crooked ass the cops to the Rampart district
# Loose yourself in the music, move it or lose it
# Abuse it, let's booze it, please don't confuse it with the
# next man, it's the X Man rollin
# Stand firm, solid as the ground I'm holdin
# Make mine +Golden+, permanent +State+ issue
# Stacked with the wealth that you can't take witchu
# Long range missile, if we got issues
# I'ma squeeze this shit and nobody gon' miss you
# I'ma keep swingin 'til the medics come get you
# We busy, stay off my line, you can't get through
# Peep the design from the mastermind
# Yo Dre, bring that shit back one more time!

# at the temple of black gods i failed again
# for you - a chilvarous end for a man
# clandestine enthralling haze
# a docile sacrifice for your grace
# resurrect from the ban they put on you
# fall again - you will - what they foreknew
# only gods illuminate
# and just a slave to be is my fate
# and you will hear me
# siren's calls of temptation
# teasing you
# no limit will be
# no taboo of imagination
# i'll fill your void
# i will always savour you
# as i will always be your fool

# Once I travelled 7 seas to find my lovw
# And once I sang 700 songs
# Well, maybe I still have to walk 7000 miles
# Until I find the one that I belong
# Once I crossed 7 rivers to find my love
# And once, for 7 years, I forgot my name
# Well, if I have to I will die 7 deaths just to lie
# In the arms of my eversleeping aim
# I will rest my head side by side
# To the one that stays in the night
# I will lose my breath in my last words of sorrow
# And whatever comes will come soon
# Dying I will pray to the moon
# That there once will be a better tomorrow
# I dreamt last night that he came to me
# He said: "My love, why do you cry?"
# For now it won't be be long any more

# something infests me when I'm alone
# it's lunacy
# I want to vomit, spit out my life
# so queer is seems
# retract your reverence and slander me
# I'm the traitor of mine
# a close-up picture of my lost chastity
# there's nothing left of me anymore
# and no rain can wash away those bloody tears
# as sweet sounds of destruction reach my ears
# red lips like roses call my name
# but laughter is all the woman of now hears
# in gloom I wander, it batters me
# though I subsist of it
# the smell of incense arouses me
# abeyance maddens me
# a ginger sunset is my caress
# as I expire
# as music's fading I fade within
# there's nothing left of me anymore
# and no rain can wash away those bloody tears
# as sweet sounds of destruction reach my ears
# red lips like roses call my name
# but laughter is all the woman of now hears

# now it's hard to hold sight

# between worlds spinning round
# i'm a stranger in my universe
# but i see my sun
# and i know that it will

# you can rain down on me

# sigh - for they make you feel alive
# try - it's just one step aside
# fly - over seas of drunken wine
# lie - cause you'll never draw a line
# cry - for they leave you cold and dead
# ride - til the last of suns is set
# don't dive too deep - too deep into the sea
# come and be a child of the blue
# we make the azure dream come true
# i drift and fall - sapphire spear inside
# they come for me and softly close my eyes
# fight - for this is your last chance
# come and be a child of the blue
# leave the past, we make it new
# you will always be our child

# do you dare to taste her soul
# do you like to trick control
# did you think this world was real
# realize this was the deal
# she's ether fire - burns away all the dire
# you will feel her touch for a while
# do you see her through the waves
# do you think it's her who saves
# with a blink of radiant eye
# would you really dare to try
# she's like a fawn - just appears and then gone
# what reamins will be just this one song
# she's eternity behind her disguise
# you have almost seen a world in her eyes
# but you've known that it would never be born
# she's flown away like a leave in a storm
# she's bliss - she's ether - she's dark - she's nirvana

# i breathe the scent of your hair
# your emerald eyes are closed
# there's still some music in the air
# feels like time no more flows
# we sit, you're in my arms
# watching the first daylight gleam
# you say: "i like your warmth"
# a voice just in a dream
# i was dreaming of the wind
# i was dreaming like a child
# a prince and princess fairy tale
# and so you disappear
# i was dreaming of the fire
# of the time when it was wild
# i was dreaming far too sweet
# and so you disappear
# in chaos waters i do swim
# and you're the stone one's thrown into
# a frail creature now gets dim
# as the gold turns into blue
# made me think you were so damn near
# like a bright shining star
# but reaching out you disappeared
# for real you are so very far

# we scintillate like cedar stones
# in plasma veil as ancient ones
# in cold war years you were my fears
# but just to gain the power to reign
# satan's bllod in our veins

# but noone dies when blackseas dry
# and noone kill. forever this will

# no sense of life
# and none afterwards
# what I call wisdom is a flower
# that can seldom be found
