# Kar nekoe, sva si bila.
# ?e dolgo, nisva si.
# Malokdaj se sreeava,
# nobeden ne zardi.
# Ali res mogoee je,
# da v mno?ici,
# obraz, ki nekoe mi bil je vse
# zdaj komaj ?e spoznam.
# So oei, ki so me tedaj,
# v mislih spremljale vse dni.
# Zgubile svoj sijaj.
# Saj morda bilo je vse,
# slepilo in privid.
# In ljubezni najine,
# bilo nikoli ni.

# Ne verjamem, da le čas
# lahko srečo spremeni,
# a če niste v sreči tej, ljubezni ni.
# Iz daljave slišim glas,
# žvižg odmeva skozi noč,
# šele zdaj vem, da je to posledni vlak.
# Rekla si, da moraš proč
# in da kmalu vrneš se,
# vedel sem, da to je njeno slovo.
# Iz daljave...
# Spremil sem te, ko si šla
# rad bi tekel za teboj,
# vpil in prosil vrni se, a sem le stal.
# Iz daljave...
# Pravijo, da sreča je
# če v ljubezni hrepeniš,
# če to ni sreči tej, ljubezni ni.
# Iz daljave...
# In tako ostal sem sam,
# na postajah svojih sanj,
# v meni vse umrlo je, le ti živiš.
# Iz daljave...

# Pridi, dala ti bom cvet,
# Ki raste le v meni,
# Le zate cveti!
# Pridi, dala ti bom cvet,
# Odprla bom zate
# Vse svoje lati!
# O pamladi nisem sanjala,
# Saj v rokah jo drzim.
# Vecnosti ne bom oznanjala,
# Se smrti ne bojim.
# Umrla bom zato,
# Da v tebi se rodim,
# Ljubi moj.
# Pridi, dala ti bom cvet,
# Cvetela sem zate,
# Utrgati smeš me le ti.

# That feeling incomplete, you carry their baggage, the guilt that holds you down

# Hey where did we go, days when the rain came.
# Down in the hollow, playin' a new game.
# Laughin' and a runnin' , hey hey, skippin' and a jumpin'
# In the misty mornin' fog with our hearts a thumpin' at you,
# The Brown-Eyed Girl
# You're my Brown-Eyed Girl
# Now what ever happened, Tuesday is so slow,
# Goin' down the old man river, with a transistor radio
# Standin' in the sunlight laughin'
# Hidin' behind a rainbow wall
# Slippin' and a slidin', all along the waterfall with you,
# The Brown-Eyed Girl
# You're my Brown-Eyed Girl.
# Do you remember when, ah we used to sing
# Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
# Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
# La dee dah
# So hard to find my way, now that I'm all on my own
# I saw you just the other day, my how you had grown,
# [.. ] Sometimes overcome thinkin' bout,
# Makin love in the green grass, behind the stadium with you.
# The Brown-Eyed Girl
# You, my Brown-Eyed Girl.
# Do you remember when, ah we used to sing

# I can´t recall the hurting words that I once said
# So long ago, still indignation clouds your head
# And it´s enough to know the pain of losing friends
# You perpetuate certain sensless hate
# And I can picture you today as you say
# "I used to know that guy" And as you speak they watch your face split in two
# And when you see me
# It´s always, hey Joe,
# How is it goin' bro?
# Where have you been man?
# We used to be such good friends
# Two-faced, you don´t care
# You know what you can do with it
# I can´t pretend
# And there you go again
# You ought to bury the hatchet
# And leave behind all of the lies
# And your disguise
# You know that I just want to
# Bury the hatchet
# How much more will you permit?
# Think about it you´ll admit
# You and I have got to bury the hatchet
# Am I really all that bad?
# Sometimes I second guess
# Often times I wonder why my head is such a mess
# But put yourself in my shoes and picture if you can
# All these insecuriries create that bitter sad man you see
# Hurting
# Not me
# I forgive, I forget
# I won´t say the things I´ll regret
# Not this time
# I will stop, but just between you and me
# It´s a loss
# I can´t recall the hurting words that I once said
# So long ago, still indignation clouds your head
# 'Cause it´s enough to know the pain of losing friends
# Fingers point at you
# Isn´t that what a child would do?
# And as you speak they´d watch your face split in two
# And when you see me
# It´s always, hey Joe,
# How is it goin' bro?
# Where have you been man?
# We used to be such good friends
# Two faced, you don´t care
# You know what you can do with it

# On the last day of God's creation
# Blood will flow from stone
# Earthquakes will destroy Your nation
# And swallow the king's throne
# And flood will follow fire
# To wash away the stains
# So finally He can rest in peace
# Now nothing of man remains
# In the kingdom of God
# The kingdom of God
# Now times was man's invention
# For regulating his ways
# But time has lost its meaning
# In cities of eternal days
# Ang every city became Godom
# Man bore the mark of Cain
# Until God raised atomic fire
# Now nothing of man remains
# In the kingdom of God
# The kingdom of God
# Now the last traces fade away
# Of His creation gone wrong
# Fish return to the river
# And whales sing their ocean song
# The bears roam in the mountains
# And buffaloes roam the plains
# Eagles fly in freedom
# Now nothing of man remains
# In the kingdom of God
# The kingdom of God
# Let silence be the music
# That settles on the Earth
# And thunder be the rhythm
# That drowns man's last words
# And let melody be the sound
# Of the wind and the lashing rain
# Blowing away man's harmonies
# Until nothing of him remains
# In the kingdom of God
# The kingdom of God
# So nothing of man remains
# In the kingdom of God

# Endless mornings cut by the dawn razor
# Whipping the nightmares to a froth
# Endless questions with no answers
# No replacement for what's been lost.
# Lost
# Everything suffocates in the dust of pase, fortunes squandered
# The empire of lies to whome you pandered
# Suffer a self-imposed exile, taste the bitter fruits of denial
# In the presence of greatness the humble can only bow.
# Frost on the breath of life
# Empty of warmth of light
# Full of nothing but deprivation
# Eternal winter.
# Tell me a liewith the best of intetntions
# Mute in the age of mass communication
# Dark days lead to darker nights
# Frozen, out of time
# Id dies for the blessed ego, the once mighty laid low.
# Frost on the breath of life
# Empty of warmth or light
# Full of nothing but deprivation
# You taught hate, I'll teach you fear
# Open the eyes, kill despair
# You tried to squeeze the life from me
# Son of bi***, I'm going to break you

# If there was a single day I could live... a single breath I could take
# I'd trade all the others away.
# The blood's on the wall, so you'd might as well just admit it
# And bleach out the stains, commit to forgetting it.
# You're better off empty and blank, than left with a single pathetic trace of this
# Smother another failure, lay this to rest.
# Console yourself, you're better alone
# Destroy yourself, see who gives a f***
# Absorb yourself, you're better alone
# Destroy yourself.
# I'll chain you to the truth for the truth shall set you free
# I'll turn the screws of vengeance and bury you with honesty
# I'll make all your dreams come to life, then slay them as quickly as they came
# Smother another failure, lay this to rest.
# Console yourself, you're better alone
# Destroy yourself, see who gives a f***
# Absorb yourself, see who gives a f***.

# Send the childrean to the fire, sons and daugthers stack the pyre
# Stoke the flame of the empire, live to lie another day
# Face of hypocrisy, raping the democracy

# Constructed a monument to denail and excess
# Sunk so low, crawled so far back there's nowhere left to regress.
# If these walls could talk, they would tell a horror story
# Never-ending winter, ciolence and infidelity
# Shadows fall through broken panes
# Careless words that are filled with hate
# Just enough to keep it together, never enough to make it work.
# All the tongues here are forked.
# We are a hailstorm of broken glass, follow the path of least expectance.
# A huge stinking pile of sick, pile it higher and higher.
# Light the match, start the fire.
# Level this place and take us with it.

# Crack of dawn brings naught but pain.

# Walk the faded line, cursed crawl of time

# Whithin my heart and my soul
# I'll wait for you
# Adagio
# All of these nights without you
# All of my dreams surround you
# I see and I touch your face
# I fall into your embrace
# When the time is right, I know
# You'll be in my arms
# Adagio
# I close my eyes and I find a way
# No need for me to pray
# I've walked so far
# I've fought so hard
# Nothing more to explain
# I know all that remains
# Is a piano that plays
# If you know where to find me
# If you know how to reach me
# Before this light fades away
# Before I run out of my faith
# Be the only man to say
# That you'll hear my heart
# That you'll give your life
# Forever you'll stay
# Don't let this light fade away
# No No No No No
# Don't let me run out of faith

# You won't let go

# Que reste-t-il de nos amours ?
# Quand s'endorment les jours
# Tous les bateaux
# Et les ruisseaux
# Chantent encore si gaiment
# Et au gre du vent
# Seul un piano se souvient
# Si dans un reve tu me cherche
# Si en priere tu m'esperes
# Avant que nos feux s'eteignent
# Avant que ma foi s'impregne
# Soit le seule homme a me dire
# Qu'tu seras ma vie
# Que tu resteras
# Toujours en moi

# Tell me her name

# Tell me again
# I want to hear
# Who broke my faith in all these years
# Who lays with you at night
# When I'm here all alone
# Remembering when I was your own
# I'll let you go
# I'll let you fly
# Why do I keep on asking why
# I'll let you go
# Now that I found
# A way to keep somehow
# More than a broken vow
# Tell me the words I never said
# Show me the tears you never shed
# Give me the touch
# That one you promised to be mine
# Or has it vanished for all time
# Chorus
# I close my eyes
# And dream of you and I
# And then I realize
# There's more to life than only bitterness and lies
# I close my eyes
# I'd give away my soul
# To hold you once again
# And never let this promise end
# Chorus
# Translation:
# Vaine Promesse
# Dis moi tout d'elle
# Je veux savoir
# Si elle est belle
# Quand tu l'attends
# Je voudrais voir sa tete
# Comprendre pourquoi tu l'aimes
# Et pourquoi nous c'est plus pareil
# Dis moi son nom
# Je veux l'entendre
# Qui en un mot a su te prendre
# Celle qui est dans tes nuits
# Quand toute seule dans mon lit
# Je me raconte nos souvenirs
# Tu peux partir
# Et t'envoler
# Meme si je vis comme un regret
# Tu peux partir
# Je survivrais
# De nous je garderai
# Plus qu'une vaine promesse
# Dis moi les mots que j'ai manque
# Pleure pour les fois qu'tu as triche
# Embrasse-moi
# Comme dans le temps des amants
# Ou est-il trop tard a present
# Refrain
# Je ferme les yeux
# Et reve de nous deux

# If you cannot stand beside me
# If there isn't love, there is only pride
# I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up this fight
# Undo this leash
# When you say I tied
# When only our fears are to blame this time
# And what am I to you
# Just spit it out
# I'm not afraid of the words that you hide
# After all we have been through
# I can only look at you
# Through the eyes you lied to
# I'm givin' up, givin' up
# I'm givin' up on you
# After all if there is no way out

# When did it all crash
# When did it start to fall apart

# All of my tears have been frozen
# After these years in this pain
# My heart has finally chosen
# To beat a bit faster again
# Now I feel the awakening
# I don't look back anymore
# I am mysteriously standing on the good side of my soul
# All I recall is the moment
# Sadness is fading away
# It is for passion I'm falling but now I'm back on my feet again
# I wanna rewrite the story
# Not even what seemed insane
# How could I ever feel sorry for being stronger than I am?
# I've cried enough
# Over the priceless time I've lost
# I've learned the going gets too tough
# Now you regret love
# I've cried enough
# What you'll see on my face again
# Is nothing but the rain
# I've cried enough
# Why would I try to deny it?
# Most of my dreams are a mess
# But what didn't kill me in fact has taught me
# Life's a big game of test
# Although in I believe in the future
# I keep in mind all the past
# Now that I live in the present
# I don't care about the rest
# I've cried enough
# Over the priceless time I've lost
# I've learn the going gets too tough
# Now you regret love
# I've cried enough

# Is the best friend you have in the world
# That moment in time
# Will help you to survive
# Silence
# Now that you've seen it
# You don't need to go back at all
# And when you feel that
# Cold room inside
# Stand tall
# You will embrace it
# As you recall
# It made you stronger after all
# Silence (Silence) Is the moment between everyone
# Is the best friend you have in the world
# That moment in time
# Will help you to survive
# Silence
# Silence
# Let your consciousness finally be heard
# It's unconscious
# But you'll hear the burst
# The voice inside will bring you back to life
# (Silence, silence)
# It's the moment in time
# (Silence, silence)
# Silence (Silence, silence)
# Let it be

# Elle descendait dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un train du sud au nord
# Elle nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢avait jamais quittÃƒÂ© son ÃƒÂ®le encore
# La Sicile ÃƒÂ©tait son rivage
# Et la famille, son paysage
# La mer et le volcan, ses seuls trÃƒÂ©sors
# Il lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢attendait dans le froid, seul sur le quai
# Comme un ami, un frÃƒÂ¨re, pour lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢escorter
# MÃƒÂªme sÃ¢â‚¬â„¢il ne parlait pas sa langue
# Ils se comprenaient comme on tremble
# Quand on sait que le destin vient de passer
# CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢est une belle histoire
# NÃƒÂ©e dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un roman rose et noir
# Tout les sÃƒÂ©pare
# MÃƒÂªme le hasard
# Ils regardaient la vie comme un chemin
# OÃƒÂ¹ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢on ne se perd quÃ¢â‚¬â„¢en se lÃƒÂ¢chant la main
# Bien que les nuits aient ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© plus froides
# Que leurs chaleureuses engueulades
# Ce qui les unit ÃƒÂ©loignait leur chagrin
# CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢est une belle histoire
# NÃƒÂ©e dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un roman rose et noir
# Tout les sÃƒÂ©pare
# MÃƒÂªme le hasard

# Free the dream within
# The stars are crying
# A tear... a sign
# Excapes from heaven
# ... And worlds end
# Breathe the dream within
# The mystifying
# Suspended within...
# Look beyond
# Where hearts can see
# Dream in peace
# Trust love.. believe
# We tramble and spin
# Suspended within...
# Free the dream within
# The voices calling
# A song... a prayer
# From deep inside you
# ... To guide you
# Be the dream within
# The light is shining
# A flame on the wind
# Salvation begins
# Look beyond
# Where hearts can see

# We can run away together
# If that's what you want
# We can hide away forever
# If that's what you want
# So just
# Close the door
# Let nobody else in our head
# Close the door
# We can lay here in our bed
# Chorus:
# Cause anything else is wasting time
# When all I've wanted
# Out of my life
# Is just to fly away
# Here by your side
# Until the end of time
# Till the last goodbye
# Let's just live here in the moment
# Sharing something real
# Let's now spend these hours talking
# Just give me something I can feel
# Baby cause
# Close to me
# You let a ray of light in me free
# Close to me
# We don't know where I and you began

# Let's shut the world out

# I was hopin' that maybe you'd show me

# Till I get over you
# I can save one prayer for love
# Till I get over you
# I can live, I can live
# Till I get over you…
# And I could never give enough
# Couldn't save it with all my love
# Watched you walk out leaving me

# Soon I found
# There was no other
# There you are
# Framed against the sky
# You are my life, I pray for when

# To love again
# I see the rain in the sky
# I see your face
# Through every tear that I cry
# With every breath and every sound
# I can hear another voice and swear that you're around

# Cause I know
# The memory won't let go
# Until you're mine
# To love…again (again)
# Who's to say what lives in the past
# Who's to say that love won't last
# Time's been standing still
# Waiting so patiently until
# Until that one day when
# When I will have you

# There you are
# Framed against the sky
# You are my life
# And I pray for when

# Ah…
# How did I ever get to here

# I used to be so strong alone

# Now I don't know what to do
# Was I too proud or just too blind
# What does it matter
# When love was in these hands of mine
# I let it shatter
# The pieces scattered to the wind
# I'll never have them here again
# But I'll remember how we were
# The rest of time
# You are my heart
# How could I ever let you go
# You are my soul

# How much you mean
# To me you are my heart
# Ah…yeah
# I think I see you everywhere
# Isn't that crazy
# I still reach out to feel you there
# Lying beside me
# I've learned a lot since you've been gone

# And so
# Fear was gone
# I knew there was nothing else I'd ever want
# I know you
# You're not from here
# I've waited for you to appear
# To take my breath away
# And make me weep
# You're not from here
# Not from this here and now
# Just a touch of yours
# And I fly, I fly and I fly...
# I can't get used to missing you
# If this is how it's gotta be
# I need an angel to watch over me
# No one can hold the hands of time
# But I can hold you in my mind
# Over and over like a melody
# For now (now)
# I'll stand still
# For now
# I'll be filled by the memory of your skin
# I know you
# You're not from here (you're not from here)
# You don't belong to lies and tears
# The greatness of your soul
# Makes me weep
# You're not from here
# Not from this here and now
# Just a touch of yours
# And I fly, and I fly, and I fly...
# You, you're not from here
# I've waited for you to appear

# Is breaking your heart
# Through the fire
# To the wire
# When the flames are burning hot
# They take you higher
# Through the fire
# There's a feeling that I can't ignore
# Like a stranger at my door
# So revealing that I cannot hide
# When you settle up the score
# Voices say -- night and day
# Live your life as if each second
# Was the final one
# Through the fire
# To the wire
# When the night out of control
# Is breaking your heart
# Through the fire
# To the wire
# When the flames are burning hot
# They take you higher
# I look for signs that you are here tonight
# When the passion calls the pleasure to the flame
# Then I ask you of the meaning when you talk of love
# Would you take the leap of faith?
# Would you throw it all away?

# Verse one
# I don't know why I feel this way but I do
# I'm worried this time that we won't make it through
# I don't know how we let things go so wrong but we did
# Could our love just be hiding or is it gone
# I just got to know
# Will we let our feelings show this time
# 'Cause...
# Chorus
# I don't wanna break your heart
# But I much rather be apart
# Than live our lives reluctantly
# Knowing we weren't meant to be
# And I don't wanna walk away
# But things just can't go on this way
# Together or apart from me
# Where do you really wanna be
# Verse Two
# It was the same old story of boy meets girl
# You wanted me, I thought I could give you the world
# Some where along the way we went astray
# Now it's all I can do just to give you a smile today
# I just got to say (yes I do)
# Baby can we find our way this time
# 'Cause

# I don't wanna break your heart

# Che divida con te i tuoi guai.
# Mai! tu non molare mai!
# Rimani come sei,
# Insegui il tuo destino,
# Perch? tutto il dolore che hai dentro
# Non potra mai cancellare il tuo cammino
# E allora scoprirai
# Che la storia di ogni nostro minuto
# Appartiene soltanto a noi.
# Ma se ancora resterai,
# Persa senza una ragione
# In un mare di perch?
# Dentro te ascolta il tuo cuore
# E nel silenzio troverai le parole.
# Chiudi gli occhi e poi tu lasciati andare,
# Prova a arrivare dentro il pianeta del cuore
# E difficile capire
# Qual e la cosa giusta da fare
# Se ti batte nella testa un'emozione.
# L'orgoglio che ti piglia,
# Le notti in cui il rimorso ti sveglia
# Per la paura di sbagliare,
# Ma se ti ritroverai
# Senza stelle da seguire
# Tu non rinunciare mai
# Credi in te! Ascolta il tuo cuore!
# Fai quel che dice anche se fa soffrire.
# Chiudi gli occhi e poi tu lasciati andare,
# Prova a volare oltre questo dolore.
# Non ti ingannerai
# Se ascolti il tuo cuore,
# Apri le braccia fino quasi a toccare
# Ogni mano, ogni speranza, ogni

# Perch? poi ti portera fino al cuore

# In questo girotondo d'anime
# chi si volta e perso e resta qua
# io so per certo amico
# mi son voltato anch'io
# e per raggiungerti ho dovuto correre
# ma piu mi guardo in giro e vedo che,
# c'e un mondo che va avanti anche se
# se tu non ci sei piu
# se tu non ci sei piu
# e dimmi perch?
# in questo girotondo d' anime
# non c'e un posto
# per scrollarsi via di dosso
# quello che ci e stato detto
# e quello che ormai si sa
# e allora sai che c'e
# c'e che c'e, c'e che prendo un treno
# che va a paradiso citta
# e vi saluto a tutti e salto su
# prendo il treno e non ci penso piu
# un viaggio ha senso solo senza ritorno
# se non in volo
# senza fermate ne confini
# solo orizzonti neanche troppo lontani
# io mi prendero il mio posto
# e tu seduta li al mio fianco
# mi dirai destinazione paradiso

# alma que se vuelve no se va
# lo s? por cierto amigo tambi?n yo me he venido
# para alcanzarte tuve mucho que correr
# y si me tiro y miro en torno mio
# vere que el mundo sigue tan feliz

# y dime porque en este carrusel un sitio no se ve
# en donde nos podamos todos
# todo lo que ya se ha dicho y todo lo que se dira

# Llamo una y otra vez
# Pero tu no estas en casa: ?Dejarme un mensaje?

# Prova e vedrai ci sarà sempre un modo
# Dentro di noi per poi riprendere il volo
# Verso il sereno
# Non siamo angeli in volo venuti dal cielo

# E resto immobile qui
# Senza parlare... non ci riesco a stancarmi di te
# E cancellare tutte le pagine con la tua immagine
# E vivere..
# Come se non fosse stato mai amore?
# .... Come se non fosse stato amore
# Come se non fosse stato mai..?
# E vorrei fuggire via, vorrei nascondermi
# Ma resto ancora così, senza parlare, senza dirti ?non te ne andare?
# Non mi lasciare tra queste pagine
# E poi, e poi, e poi
# Vivere
# Come se non fosse stato mai amore
# Come se non fosse stato amore

# La solitudine e un peccato
# Per tutti quelli come me
# Que nella vita hanno perduto
# Un grande amore dentro se
# Quando l'amore ti fa male
# Non puo resistere di piu
# Ma come me c'e una tribu
# Di gente che alla fine non si arrende
# Dimmi dove sei
# Adesso che ti sto cercando
# In tutti giorni miei
# Per te cosa darei ti prego
# Ah Per tutti quelli come me
# In tutti giorni miei
# Ti prego dimmi dove sei
# En un mundo que,
# vive sin amor,

# Y la inmensidad,

# Y vuela sobre el gesto de la gente,
# a todo lo m?s noble indiferente,
# aleja el beso c?lido de amor,
# de puro amor...
# En un mundo que,

# d?di?e pour la france!
# Pour marcher
# Hors de tes traces
# Pour t'oublier
# Entre le feu et la glace
# Je laisserai les larmes
# De celui qui passe
# J'emporte au loin
# La flamme d'un seul jour
# J'emporte au loin
# Le fleuve sans retour

# Oublie-moi, oublie-moi
# tanto che come il sole all'improvviso
# scoppiera, scoppiera...
# nel mondo
# io non amero
# tanto che poi il cuore non mi fara male.
# E se fosse per nostalgia
# Tutta questa malinconia che mi prende
# Tutte le sere
# E se fosse la gelosia
# Che mi fa vedere cose
# Che esistono soltanto nella mia mente
# E se fossero emozioni
# Tutte quelle sensazioni di fastidio e di paura che ho
# Quando vedo i tuoi pensieri
# E capisco che da ieri
# Tu te ne eri gia andato via
# E se fosse una canzone
# fatta solo per ricordare
# Quei momenti in cui sei stato mio eh..
# E se fosse un?illusione
# Tutta questa benedetta passione
# Che per un istante mi ha portato via

# verso un giorno disperato
# ma io ho sete
# ho sete ancora.
# E vivro, si vivro
# tutto il giorno per vederti andar via
# fra i ricordi e questa strana pazzia
# e il paradiso, che non esiste
# chi vuole un figlio non insiste.
# Tu dimmi quando, quando
# Io come un albero nudo nudo senza te
# senza foglie e radici ormai
# abbandonata cosi
# per rinascere mi servi qui
# e vedo noi stretti dentro noi
# legati per non slegarsi mai
# in ogni lacrima tu sarai per non dimenticarti mai
# E mi manchi amore mio
# tu mi manchi come quando cerco Dio
# e in assenza di te
# io ti vorrei per dirti che
# tu mi manchi amore mio
# il dolore e forte come un lungo addio
# e l'assenza di te
# e un vuoto dentro me
# I can't pretend anymore
# That I'm not affected, I'm not moved
# I can't lie to myself, that I'm not, always thinking of you
# You make me strong
# You show me I'm not weak to fall in love
# When I thought I'd never need, now I can't get enough
# I always made it on my own
# I always thought that I would keep control
# You changed everything I believe in
# Now I just can't fight this feeling baby
# I raise my hands and I surrender
# 'Cause your love is too strong, and I can't go on
# Without your tender arms around me
# I raise my hands and I surrender
# I don?t wanna resist, 'cause your touch and your kiss
# Have shattered my defenses

# Non c'è... via d'uscita per questo amore
# Non c'è... non c'è vita per me, più
# Non c'è... non c'è altra ragione che mi liberi l'anima
# Incantenata a notte di follia
# Anche in prigione me ne andrai per te
# Solo una vita non basta per me
# E anche l'estate ha le sue nuvole
# E tu sei l'uragano contro me
# Strappando i sogni nei giorni miei te ne sei andato di fretta perché
# Non c'è... non che il veleno di te sul cuore
# Non c'è... via d'uscita per questo amore
# Non c'è... non chevita per me, più
# Non c'è... altra ragione per me
# Se esiste un Dio no può scordarsi di me anche se
# Fra lui e me c'è un cielo nero nero senza fine

# Ormai per me sei diventeto l'unica ragione
# Se c'è un confine nell'amore giuro lo passerò
# E nell'imenso vuoto di quei giorni senza fine ti amerò

# Questo volerti per me
# Averti adosso per non fare asciugare
# Dalla boca il sapore di te
# Sei il bene e il male
# Una battaglia un carnevale
# Sei la passione che
# No, non ha tregua per me, dolcemente
# Mi spiazzi il cuore ed io, ti porter?
# Dentro le mie tasche, ovunque andrai andrai
# Come una moneta, un amuleto
# Che tra le mie mani, stringer?
# Sei la mia prigione, l'evasione dentro me
# Oltre la ragione
# Solamente io conosco cosa c'?
# Quell'amore che io ho per te
# Io te porter?
# Dentro le mie tasche, ovunque andrai
# Come un incantesimo segreto
# Per i giomi vuoti che vivr?
# Per inseguirti in ogni viaggio, che farai
# Dentro le mie tasche, ovunque che andrai
# Come una moneta, un amuleto
# Che tra le mie mani, stringer?.

# nei tuoi occhi che mi stano a guardare, non dimenticare
# E dificile per me imparare a vivere
# senza abbandonarmi al mio presente

# Ero qui. eri qui
# parlare adesso non ha piu senso, o forse si
# Per che una vita sola non puo bastare
# per dimenticare quanto si puo amare
# al tuo nome e alla tua voce pensare senza farmi male
# E una vita sola non puo bastare
# per dimenticare una storia che vale
# ogni minimo particolare, non dimenticare, non dimenticare
# eh, eh, eh...
# Ero qui

# eri qui
# (che cosa ha piu di me)
# sto cercando una ragione parlane adesso
# non ha piu senso o forse si
# Per che una vita sola non puo bastare
# per dimenticare come si puo amare
# quanto sole che si puo atravesare

# Girls you know you'd- better, watch out (Watch out!)
# Some guys, some guys are only about (About!)
# That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)
# That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)
# Throw your hands in the air!
# Admit two shots in the atmosphere!
# [Verse One - Lauryn]
# It's been 3 weeks since you've been looking for your friend
# The one you let hit it and never called you again
# Remember when he told you he was about the benjamins?
# You act like you ain't hear him, but gave him a little trim
# To begin, how you think you're really going to pretend
# Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
# Plus when, you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
# If you did it then, then you'll probably fuck again
# Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian
# A Muslim, sleeping with the Gin
# Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
# Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?
# Showing off your ass because your thinking it's a trend
# Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again!
# You know I only say it because i'm truly genuine
# Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem
# Baby girl! Respect is just the minimum
# Niggas fucked up and your still defending them
# Now -- Lauryn is only human
# Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
# Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
# It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
# Look at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
# Fake nails done by Koreans
# Come again
# Yo! A-When when come again! (Yeah-Yeah!)
# When when come again!! (Yeah-Yeah!)
# My friend come again!!! (Yeah-Yeah!)
# [Chorus - Lauryn]
# Guys you know you'd better, watch out (Watch out!)
# Some girls, some girls are only, about (About!)
# That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)
# That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)
# [Verse Two - Lauryn]
# The second verse is dedicated to the men
# More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
# Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
# Don't care who they offend
# Popping yang (Like you got yen!)
# Let's not pretend, they wanna pack pistol by they waist men,
# Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
# The pretty face men claiming that they claiming that they did a bid men
# Need to take care of their three and four kids
# But they face a court case when the child support's late
# Money taking and heart breaking
# Now you wonder why women hate men
# The sneaky silent men
# The punk domestic violence men
# Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men!
# How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?!
# How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?!
# How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?!
# Unh-Unhh Come Again!
# Bro-Straight come again!
# Sit straight come again!
# Watch out, watch out
# Look out, look out
# Watch out, watch out
# Look out, look out
# Watch out, watch out
# Look out, look out
# Watch out, watch out
# Look out, look out

# "Kill the Guy" in Carter Park
# Rode a Mongoose 'til it's dark

# Possibly speak tongues
# Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist
# Rap this in fine linen, from the beginning
# My practice extending across the atlas
# I begat this
# Flipping in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
# You can't match this rapper slash actress
# More powerful than two Cleopatras
# Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti
# MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti
# My rhymes is heavy like the mind of sister Betty (Betty Shabazz!)
# L-Boogie spars with stars and constellations
# Then came down for a little conversation
# Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
# Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum
# Now hear this mixture, where Hip Hop meets scripture
# Develop a negative into a positive picture
# Now Everything Is Everything

# Sometimes it seems
# We'll touch that dream
# But things come slow or not at all
# And the ones on top, won't make it stop
# So convinced that they might fall

# To make a better situation
# Tomorrow, our seeds will grow
# All we need is dedication
# Let me tell ya that...

# Get yours in this capitalistic system
# So many caught or got bought you can't list them
# How you gonna idolize the missing?
# To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
# Even when they comin' gunnin'
# I stand position
# L's known the mission since conception
# Let's free the people from deception
# If you looking for the answers
# Then you gotta ask the questions
# And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto
# Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto
# Why black people always be the one to settle
# March through these streets like Soweto
# Like Cain and Abel, Ceasar and Brutus, Jesus and Judas
# Backstabbers do this
# Forgive them father for they know not what they do(2x)
# It took me a little while to discover
# Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
# Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves
# A friend once said, and I found to be true
# That everyday people, they lie to God too

# Forgive them father for they know not what they do

# He was the ocean and I was the sand
# He stole my heart like a thief in the night
# Dulled my senses blurred my sight
# I used to love him but now I don't
# I used to love him but now I don't
# I chose a road of passion and pain
# Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
# Gave up my power ceased being queen
# Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
# Torn and confused wasted and used
# Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
# Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated
# For something to happen that just wasn't fated
# Thought what I wanted was something I needed
# When momma said no I just should have heeded
# Misled I bled till the poison was gone
# And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn
# I used to love him but now I don't
# I used to love him but now I don't
# Father you saved me and showed me that life
# Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
# Showed me that love was repect and devotion
# Greater than planets deeper than any ocean
# See my soul was weary but now it's relenished
# Content because that part of my life is finished
# I see him sometimes in the look of his eyes
# Is one of a man whose lost treasured untold
# But my heart is gold I took back my soul
# And totally let my creator control
# The life which was his to begin with
# I used to love him but now I don't

# It's funny how money change a situation
# Miscommunication leads to complicatioon
# My emancipation don't fit your equation
# I was on the humble, you-on every station
# Sone wan' play young Lauren like she dumb
# But remember not a game new under the sun
# Everything you did has already been done
# I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
# My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
# Now understand L. Boogie's non-violent
# But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
# Can't take a threat to mi new-born son
# L.'s been this way since creation
# A groupie call, you fall from temptaion
# Now you wanna ball over separation
# Tarnish my image in your conversation
# Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion
# You might win some but you just lost one
# You might win some but you just lost one
# You might win some but you just lost one
# You might win some but you just lost one
# You might win some but you just lost one
# Now, now how come your talk trun cold
# Gained the whole world for the price of your soul
# Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
# Now you're all floss, what a sight to behold
# Wisdom is better than silver and gold
# I was hopeless I'm on Hope Road
# Every man want to act like he's exempt
# When him need to get down on his knees and repent
# Can't slick talk on the day of judgement
# Your movement's similar to a serpent
# Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
# Consequence is no coincidence
# Hypocrites always want to make it seem like good intent
# Never want to face it when it's time for punishment
# I know that you don't wanna hear my opinion
# But there come many paths and you must choose one
# And if you don't change then the rain soon come
# See you might win some but you just lost one
# You might win some but you just lost one
# You might win some but you just lost one
# You might win some but you just lost one
# You might win some but you just lost one
# You might win some but you really lost one
# You just lost one, it's so silly how come
# When it's all done did you realls gain from
# What you done done, it's so silly how come
# You just lost one
# Now don't you understand man universal law
# What you throw out comes back to you, star
# Neverunderestimate those who you scar
# Cause karma, karma, karma  comes back to you hard
# You can't hold God's people back for long
# The chain of Shatan wasn't made that strong
# Trying to pretend like you r word is your bond
# But until you do right, all you do is go wrong
# Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
# And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone
# Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
# And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
# Now, some might listen and some might shun
# And some may think that they've reached perfection
# If you look closely you'll see what you've become
# Cause you might win some but you just lost one
# You might win some but you just lost one
# You might win some but you just lost one
# You might win some but you just lost one
# You might win some but you just lost one
# You might win some but you really lost one
# You just lost one, it's so silly how come
# When it's all done did you realls gain from
# What you done done, it's so silly how come
# You just lost one    (Repeat to end)

# Uh, uh, the unexpected, uh
# Multidimensional, am I lazier?
# Sounds of the Refugee All Stars, yeah
# The sweetest thing I've ever known
# Was like the kiss on the collarbone
# The soft caress of happiness
# The way you walk, your style of dress
# I wish I didn't get so weak
# Oh, oh, ooh baby just to hear you speak
# Makes me argue just to see
# How much you're in love with me
# See like a queen, a queen upon her throne
# It was the sweet, sweet, the sweetest thing I've known
# It was the sweet, (sweet) sweetest thing I've known
# I get mad when you walk away
# (Don't walk away from me)
# So I tell you leave when I mean stay
# Warm as the sun dipped in black
# Fingertips on the small of my back
# More valuable than all I own
# Like your precious, precious, precious, precious, precious, precious baby dark skin tone
# It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known
# It was the, oh
# I tried to explain (I can't explain)
# (I can't explain it)
# Oh, but baby it's in vain
# Speaking on my mother's phone
# The touching makes me think I'm grown
# (You ain't grown)
# Sweet prince of the ghetto
# (Sweet prince of the ghetto)
# Your kisses taste like Almoretto
# Intoxicating (intoxicating) oh so intoxicating (intoxicating)
# How sad (it's so sad) how sad that (so sad) all things come to an end, ho
# But then again I'm, I'm not alone
# It was the sweet, sweetest thing I've known
# (Know what I mean)
# It was the sweet, sweetest thing I've known
# I sometimes watch you in your sleep, yeah
# Oh excuse me if I get to deep, hey
# (Know what I mean)
# It was the sweet (the sweet) the sweetest thing I've known
> Lauryn Hill
# Unsure of what the balance held
# I touched my belly overwhelmed
# By what I had been chosen to perform
# But then an angel came one day
# Told me to kneel down and pray
# For unto me a man child would be boren
# Woe this crazy circumstance
# I knew his life deserved a chance
# But everybody told me to be smart
# Look at your career, they said
# "Lauryn, baby, use your head"
# But instead I chose to use my heart
# Now the joy of my world is in Zion
# Now the joy of my world is in Zion
# How beautiful if nothing more
# Then to wait at Zion's door
# I've never been in love like this before
# Now let me pray to keep you from
# The perils that will surely come
# See life for you, my prince, has just begun
# And I thank you for choosing me
# To come through unto life to be
# A beautiful reflection of his grace
# For I know that a gift so great
# Is one only God could create
# And I'm reminded every time I see your face
# That the joy of my world is in Zion
# Now the joy of my world is in Zion
# Now the joy of my world is in Zion
# Now the joy of my world is in Zion
# Marching, marching, marching, marching to Zion
# Marching, marching, marching
# Marching, marching, marching, marching to Zion
# Marching
# Beautiful, beautiful Zion

# It's potion like this ocean that might carry me
# In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me
# And every word, every second, and every third
# Expresses the happiness more clearly than ever heard (uh)
# And when I play them, every chord is a poem
# Telling the Lord how grateful I am cause I know him (what? word)

# dove il tempo scorre più invano
# di una certezzo forse perduta e sepolta
# Ma c'è posto anche qui pe te
# Si c'è posto anche qui per te
# In questo mio cammino avrai tutto quello che vuoi, che vuoi
# La tua vanità è più forte della mia volontà
# ma in fondo è giusto che tu mi consumi così, così
# Ma alle due e mezza mi accorgo che è già tardi
# per pensare di arrivare in orario da te
# che mi conduci ogni volta che vuoi
# alla tua porta celeste e molesta
# Oggi in veste d'amante
# Oggi in veste d'amante
# ma sono già per domani un tuo ricordo costante, costante
# La tua vanità è più forte della mia volontà
# Ma in fondo è giusto che tu mi consumi così, così
# Xunah, Xunah, Xunah
# Xunah, Xunah, Xunah
# Xunah, Xunah, Xunah
# Ma ora è tardi e non c'è tempo per vivere
# quei giochi di lotta che piacciono a te
# domani è un altro giorno
# e forse accadrà
# che andremo a vivere insieme felici
# Ora dormi che è tardi
# Ora dormi che è tardi
# La luna è piena e avrai
# nuovi sogni e speranze ed incanti
# La tua vanità è più forte della mia volontà
# e in fondo è giusto che tu mi consumi così, così

# The limits of our yesterdays
# If it brings us down,
# it wouldn't be the first time
# Over and over,
# we put our hearts on the line
# Every time we fall,
# we get a little stronger, baby
# Every time we walk away,
# it hurts a little more
# Someday we may find
# We can make it last this time
# Until then we give it all
# Every time we fall..
# When you're gone, you'll still burn in me
# And I'm jealous of the sun that warms you
# But still I know, I'm walking in your dreams
# And I ain't seen the last of you
# Kuz there's a part of you
# That never really leaves
# Over and over, you keep coming back to me
# Every time we fall,
# we get a little stronger, baby
# Every time we walk away,
# it hurts a little more
# Someday we may find
# We can make it last this time
# Until then we give it all
# Every time we fall..
# When one road ends
# There's always another one to try
# So we go through these changes,
# time and time again
# For you and me, there's no good-bye,
# no good-bye..
# Kuz there's a part of you
# That never really leaves
# Over and over, you keep coming back to me

# And grace my fears relieved.
# How precious did that grace appear
# The hour I first believed.
# When we've been dead ten thousand years
# Bright shining as the sun,
# We've no less days to sing God's praise
# Then when we first begun.
# Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
# That saved a wretch like me.
# I once was lost, but now I'm found.
# Was blind, but now I see.

# Time, sometimes the time just slips away
# And your left with yesterday
# Left with the memories
# I, I'll always think of you and smile
# And be happy for the time
# I had you with me
# Though we go our seperate ways
# I won't forget so don't forget
# The memories we made
# Please remember, please remember
# I was there for you
# And you were there for me
# Please remember, our time together
# The time was yours and mine
# While we were wild and free
# Please remember, please remember me
# Goodbye, there's just no sadder word to say
# And it's sad to walk away
# With just the memories
# Who's to know what might have been
# We'll leave behind a life and time
# I'll never know again
# Please remember, please remember
# I was there for you
# And you were there for me
# And remember, Please remember me

# Please remember, our time together
# The time was yours and mine
# While we were wild and free
# Then remember, please remember me
# And how we laugh and how we smile
# And how this heart was yours and mine
# And how a dream was out of reach
# I stood by you, you stood by me
# We took each day and made it shine
# We wrote our names across the sky
# We ride so fast, we ride so free
# And I knew that you had me

# Stillness filled the Heavens, on crucifixion day.
# Some say it rained, I don't know if it's true.
# Well, I can just imagine ten thousand angels cried
# That would seem like rain to me and you.
# The angels all stood ready to take Him from the tree
# They waited for the words from His voice.
# And when he asked the father why has thou forsaken me.
# They watched the saviour die of his own choice.
# I've never seen ten thousand angels cry
# But I'm sure they did
# As they stood by
# And watched the saviour die.
# God turned his head away
# He couldn't bear the sight
# It must have looked like rain
# When ten thousand angels cried.
# As the sun slipped away
# The skies turned to grey
# And when Jesus gave his all
# That's when the tears began to fall
# I've never seen ten thousand angels cry
# But I'm sure they did
# As they stood by
# And watched the saviour die.
# God turned his head away
# He couldn't bear the sight
# It must have looked like rain
# When ten thousand angels cried.
# It must have looked like rain

# Some say love it is a river

# Some say love it is a razor
# That leaves your soul to bleed.
# Some say love it is a hunger
# An endless, aching need
# I say love it is a flower,
# And you it's only seed.
# It's the heart afraid of breaking
# That never learns to dance
# It's the dream afraid of waking
# That never takes the chance
# It's the one who won't be taken,
# Who cannot seem to give
# And the soul afraid of dying
# That never learns to live.
# And the night has been too lonely
# And the road has been too long.
# And you think that love is only
# For the lucky and the strong.
# Just remember in the winter
# Far beneath the bitter snow
# Lies the seed that with the sun's love,
# In the spring, becomes a rose.

# It was an April morning, When they told us we should go
# As I turn to you, You smiled at me
# How could we say no?
# With all the fun to have, To live the dreams we always had
# Woa the songs to sing, When we at last return again
# Sending off a glancing kiss, To those who claim they know
# To know the streets the seaman hears, The devil is in his hole
# Oh to sail away, To sandy lands and other days
# Oh to touch the dream, Hides inside and never seen, yeah
# Into the sun the south the north, Lies the first of hope
# The shackles of commitment fell, In pieces on the ground
# Oh to ride the wind, To tread the air above the din
# Oh to laugh aloud, Dancing as we fought the crowd
# To seek the man whose pointing hand
# The giant step unfolds
# With guidance from the curving path
# That churns up into stone
# If one bell should ring, In celebration for a king
# So fast the heart should beat,
# As proud the head with heavy feet, yeah
# (Cool Guitar Solo)
# Days went by when you and I
# Made an eternal summers glow
# As far away and distant
# Our mutual time to grow
# Oh the sweet refrain
# Soothes the soul and calms the pain
# Oh Albion remains, sleeping now to rise again
# Wandering upon the rings
# What place to rest the search
# The mighty arms of Atlas
# Hold the heavens from the earth
# The mighty arms of Atlas
# Hold the heavens from the earth
# From the earth
# Ooooooooooooooh
# I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way (2x)

# To chase a feather in the wind
# Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
# There moves a thread that has no end.
# For many hours and days that pass ever soon

# Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace,
# Await their place within the ring of calm;
# Still stand to turn in seconds of release,
# Await the call they know may never come.
# In times of lightness, no intruder dared upon
# To jeopardize the course, upset the run;
# And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun
# As love in the halls of plenty overrun.
# Aaah, ahhh...
# Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast,
# Unending dances shadowed on the day.
# Within their walls, their daunting formless keep,
# Preserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay.
# Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep,
# Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray;
# And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed,
# But no one seemed to question in anyway.
# Aaah, ahhh...
# How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land
# To seek the unsuspecting and the weak;
# And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand
# Toward the foe that threatened from the deep.
# Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand
# Adrift upon a sea of futile speech?
# And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan'
# ...............reach
# Singin'....
# Where was your word, where did you go?
# Where was your helping, where was your bow? Bow.
# Dull is the armour, cold is the day.
# Hard was the journey, dark was the way. Way.
# I heard the word; I couldn't stay. Oh.
# I couldn't stand it another day, another day-ay,
# Another day, another day.
# Touched by the timely coming,
# Roused from the keeper's sleep,
# Release the grip, throw down the key.
# Held now within the knowing,
# Rest now within the peace.
# Take of the fruit, but guard the seed.
# They had to stay!
# Held now within the knowing,
# Rest now within the beat.
# Take of the fruit, but guard the seed...

# Mmm, I'm telling you now,
# The greatest thing you ever can do now,
# Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now,

# Spent my days with a woman unkind, Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
# Made up my mind to make a new start, Going To California with an aching in my heart.
# Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
# Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.
# The sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
# The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
# as the children of the sun began to awake.
# Seems that the wrath of the Gods
# Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
# I think I might be sinking.
# Throw me a line if I reach it in time
# I'll meet you up there where the path
# Runs straight and high.
# To find a queen without a king,
# They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la
# Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
# Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.
# Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
# Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.

# I am a traveler of both time and space, to be where I have been
# To sit with elders of the gentle race, this world has seldom seen
# They talk of days for which they sit and wait and all will be revealed
# Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace, whose sounds caress my ear
# But not a word I heard could I relate, the story was quite clear

# Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace, like thoughts inside a dream
# Heed the path that led me to that place, yellow desert stream
# My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again
# Sure as the dust that floats high in June, when movin' through Kashmir.
# Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails, across the sea of years
# With no provision but an open face, along the straits of fear

# And the voices of those who stand looking.
# Ooh, it makes me wonder,
# Ooh, it really makes me wonder.
# And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
# Then the piper will lead us to reason.
# And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
# And the forests will echo with laughter.
# If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
# It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
# Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
# There's still time to change the road you're on.
# And it makes me wonder.
# Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
# The piper's calling you to join him,
# Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
# Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.
# And as we wind on down the road
# Our shadows taller than our soul.
# There walks a lady we all know
# Who shines white light and wants to show
# How everything still turns to gold.
# And if you listen very hard
# The tune will come to you at last.
# When all are one and one is all
# To be a rock and not to roll.
# And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

# Measuring a summer's day,
# I only finds it slips away to grey,
# The hours, they bring me pain.
# Tangerine, Tangerine,
# Living reflection from a dream;
# I was her love, she was my queen,
# And now a thousand years between.
# Thinking how it used to be,
# Does she still remember times like these
# To think of us again?
# And I do.

# Baby sometimes seem to slip into days
# When a minute seems like a lifetime

# Oh time moves so slow
# I've been watchin for the hands to move
# Until I just can't look no more
# How come twenty four hours
# Baby sometimes seems to slip into days
# A minute seems like a lifetime
# Baby when I feel this way
# To sing a song for you
# I recall you used to say
# "Oh baby this one's for we too"
# Which in the end is you anyway
# How come twenty four hours
# Baby sometimes slip into days
# A minute seems like a lifetime
# Oh baby when I feel this way
# There was a time that I stood tall
# In the eyes of other men
# But by my own choice I left you woman
# And now I can't get back again

# Queen of Light took her bow, And then she turned to go,
# The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom, And walked the night alone.
# Oh, dance in the dark of night, Sing to the morning light.
# The dark Lord rides in force tonight, And time will tell us all.
# Oh, throw down your plow and hoe, Rest not to lock your homes.
# Side by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all.
# I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below,
# I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, waiting for the eastern glow.
# The apples of the valley hold, The seeds of happiness,
# The ground is rich from tender care, Repay, do not forget, no, no.
# Dance in the dark of night, sing to the morning light.
# The apples turn to brown and black, The tyrant's face is red.
# Oh the war is common cry, Pick up you swords and fly.
# The sky is filled with good and bad that mortals never know.
# Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow,
# Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow.
# The pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermath,
# The drums will shake the castle wall, the ring wraiths ride in black, Ride on.
# Sing as you raise your bow, shoot straighter than before.
# No comfort has the fire at night that lights the face so cold.
# Oh dance in the dark of night, Sing to the morning light.
# The magic runes are writ in gold to bring the balance back. Bring it back.

# I don't want to ever lose my faith
# In all the little simple things.
# And even if it all falls down,
# I know it'll come back around.
# I never wanna not believe,
# That someone has a plan for me.
# Live every moment as if, its the last one.
# Find all the love deep within, give it away.
# Be thankful for all that I've been given.
# From now on, this is how I want to write,
# The story of my life.
# I wanna turn the pages of the past.
# Take what I've learned and then never look back.
# Still I never want to get too far ahead,
# Or worry about how the story ends.
# Live every moment as if it's the last one.
# Find all the love deep within, give it away.
# Be thankful for all that I've been given.
# From now on, this is how I want to write,
# The story of my life.

# Between his goodbye
# And by the way how have you been?
# He talked about the weather
# I thought of nights I held him so close
# There I go
# Thinkin with my heart again
# His smile brought back the best times
# Sweet memories of nights together
# Stirrin up those old feelins
# That got me thinkin bout forever
# He said I'd best be goin
# There's someone waitin for me outside
# And I'm dyin
# There he goes
# And here I go

# Howling winds for lullabys
# No one there to soothe her fright
# Nowhere to turn but the inward light

# While they are still here in bloom
# Does there have to be a reason
# If you don't think we'll be gone real soon
# Life is here can you taste it
# The future no one can see
# So step aside and let it be
# Tomorrow may wash away
# Don't put off what you do today
# Take advantage while you are here
# 'Cause this moment is all there is
# Don't live in fear and weakness
# Don't live and hide it all, does your
# Your ability to taste the sweetness, sweetness
# And that is what we are here for
# Life is real, don't you fake it
# Oh the future no one can see

# What did I do with my life?

# And even though I really love you
# I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
# It'll all get better in time
# I couldn't turn on the TV
# Without something there to remind me
# Was it all that easy
# To just put aside your feelings
# If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh
# Hurt my feelings but that's the path
# I believe in
# And I know that time will heal it
# If you didn't notice boy you meant everything
# Quickly I'm learning to love again
# All I know is I'ma be ok
# [Chorus:]
# Thought I couldn't live without you
# It's gonna hurt when it heals too
# It'll all get better in time
# And even though I really love you
# I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
# It'll all get better in time
# Since there's no more you and me
# It's time I let you go
# So I can be free
# And live my life how it should be
# No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you
# Yes I will

# Thought I couldn't live without you
# It's gonna hurt when it heals too

# Closed off from love
# I didn’t need the pain
# Once or twice was enough
# And it was all in vain
# Time starts to pass
# Before you know it you’re frozen
# But something happened
# For the very first time with you
# My heart melts into the ground
# Found something true
# And everyone’s looking round
# Thinking I’m going crazy
# But I don’t care what they say
# I’m in love with you
# They try to pull me away
# But they don’t know the truth
# My heart’s crippled by the vein
# That I keep on closing
# You cut me open and I
# Keep bleeding
# Keep, keep bleeding love
# I keep bleeding
# I keep, keep bleeding love
# Keep bleeding
# Keep, keep bleeding love
# You cut me open
# Trying hard not to hear
# But they talk so loud
# Their piercing sounds fill my ears
# Try to fill me with doubt
# Yet I know that the goal
# Is to keep me from falling
# But nothing’s greater
# Than the rush that comes with your embrace
# And in this world of loneliness
# I see your face
# Yet everyone around me
# Thinks that I’m going crazy, maybe, maybe
# But I don’t care what they say
# I’m in love with you
# They try to pull me away
# But they don’t know the truth
# My heart’s crippled by the vein
# That I keep on closing
# You cut me open and I....
# Keep bleeding
# Keep, keep bleeding love
# I keep bleeding
# I keep, keep bleeding love
# Keep bleeding
# Keep, keep bleeding love
# You cut me open
# And it’s draining all of me
# Oh they find it hard to believe
# I’ll be wearing these scars
# For everyone to see
# I don’t care what they say
# I’m in love with you
# They try to pull me away
# But they don’t know the truth
# My heart’s crippled by the vein
# That I keep on closing
# You cut me open and I....
# Keep bleeding
# Keep, keep bleeding love
# I keep bleeding
# I keep, keep bleeding love
# Keep bleeding
# Keep, keep bleeding love
# You cut me open and I....

# There's nothing I could say to you
# Nothing I could ever do to make you see
# What you mean to me
# All the pain, the tears I cried
# Still you never said goodbye and now I know
# How far you'd go
# I know I let you down
# But it's not like that now
# This time I'll never let you go
# I will be, all that you want
# And get myself together
# Cause you keep me from falling apart
# All my life, I'll be with you forever
# To get you through the day
# And make everything okay
# I thought that I had everything
# I didn't know what life could bring
# But now I see, honestly
# You're the one thing I got right
# The only one I let inside
# Now I can breathe, cause you're here with me
# And if I let you down
# I'll turn it all around
# Cause I would never let you go
# I will be, all that you want
# And get myself together
# Cause you keep me from falling apart
# All my life, I'll be with you forever
# To get you through the day
# And make everything okay
# Cause without you I cant sleep
# I'm not gonna ever, ever let you leave
# You're all I've got, you're all I want
# Yeah
# And without you I don't know what I'd do
# I can never, ever live a day without you
# Here with me, do you see,
# You're all I need
# And I will be, all that you want
# And get myself together

# And I can barely look at you
# But every single time I do
# I know we’ll make it anywhere
# Away from here
# Light up, light up
# As if you have a choice
# Even if you cannot hear my voice
# I’ll be right beside you dear
# Louder louder
# And we’ll run for our lives
# I can hardly speak I understand
# Why you
# Can’t raise your voice to say
# To think
# I might not see those eyes
# Makes it so hard not to cry
# And as we say
# Our long goodbye
# I nearly do
# Light up
# Slower slower
# We don’t have time for that
# All I want is
# To find an easier way
# To get out
# Of our little heads
# Have heart my dear
# We’re bound to be afraid
# Even if
# It’s just for a few days

# He’s the kind of guy who’s always passin’ by
# and never has time to spend
# And he’ll take you for a spin
# and won’t look within to find out who you are
# And he numbs himself with weed, he’s from the coldest breed
# who judge by what they see
# And I thought he was smart enough to know that the girl on his arm will
# never calm his storms
# Chorus:
# Watch out!  He’ll charm you.
# Smoother than the L.A. weather, that’s how he holds himself together
# He’s colder than the winter, I wrap my coat around together
# Cataract, it’s charm attack that leaves me hungry well,
# I’m no savior, but I tried to save you
# Ooh.. my.. love
# It’s raging high inside
# And he has his minions with no real opinions
# ‘cause they only walk on glass
# And your lies become the truth
# and give me proof that you really care
# And with your gorgeous friend you have the world so dim
# believe an and everything you say
# Chorus
# (Music)
# Smoother than the L.A. weather, that’s how he holds himself together
# He’s colder than the winter, I wrap my coat around together
# Cataract, it’s charm attack that leaves me hungry well,

# Ooh... ooh... (2x)
# And he stamps out every emotion and
# he dampens each and every explosion

# The birds they sang
# At the break of day
# Start again
# I heard them say
# Don't dwell on what
# Has passed away
# Or what is yet to be
# The wars they will
# Be fought again
# The holy dove
# Be caught again
# Bought and sold
# And bought again
# The dove is never free
# CHORUS
# Ring the bells that still can ring
# Forget your perfect offering
# There is a crack in everything
# That's how the light gets in
# We asked for signs
# The signs were sent
# The birth betrayed
# The marriage spent
# The widowhood
# Of every government
# Signs for all to see
# Can't run no more
# With the lawless crowd
# While the killers in high places
# Say their prayers out loud
# But they've summoned up
# A thundercloud
# And they're going to hear from me
# CHORUS
# You can add up the parts
# But you won't have the sum
# You can strike up the march
# There is no drum
# Every heart
# To love will come
# But like a refugee

# So we're drinking and we're dancing
# And the band is really happening
# And the Johnny Walker wisdom running high
# And my very sweet companion
# She's the Angel of Compassion
# And she's rubbing half the world against her thigh
# Every drinker every dancer
# Lifts a happy face to thank her
# And the fiddler fiddles something so sublime
# All the women tear their blouses off
# The men they dance on the polka-dots
# And it's partner found and partner lost
# And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
# It's closing time
# We're lonely, we're romantic
# And the cider's laced with acid
# And the Holy Spirit's crying, "Where's the beef?"
# And the moon is swimming naked
# And the summer night is fragrant
# With a mighty expectation of relief
# So we struggle and we stagger
# Down the snakes and up the ladder
# To the tower where the blessed hours chime
# And I swear it happened just like this
# A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
# The Gates of Love they budged an inch
# I can't say much has happened since
# But closing time
# I loved you for your beauty
# But that doesn't make a fool of me
# You were in it for your beauty too
# I loved you for your body
# There's a voice that sounds like God to me
# Declaring that your body's really you
# I loved you when our love was blessed
# And I love you now there's nothing left
# But sorrow and a sense of overtime
# And I miss you since the place got wrecked
# By the winds of change and the weeds of sex
# Looks like freedom but it feels like death
# It something in betwen, I guess
# It's closing time
# We're drinking and we're dancing
# But there's nothing really happening
# The place is dead as Heaven on a Saturday night
# And my very close companion
# Gets me fumbling gets me laughing
# She's a hundred but she's wearing
# Something tight
# I lift my glass to the awful truth
# Which you can't reveal to the ears of youth
# Except to say it isn't worth a dime
# And the whole dam place goes crazy twice
# And it's once for the Dvil and it's once for Christ
# But the boss don't like these dizzy heights
# We're busted in the blinding lights
# Of closing time
> Leonard Cohen
# The man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread
# "I never even knew how much I wanted you," she said
# His muscles, they were numbered, and his style was obsolete
# "Oh bay, I have come too late."
# She knelt beside his feet
# "I'll never see a face like yours in years of men to come
# I'll never see such arms again in wrestling or love."
# And all his virtues burning in the smokey holocaust
# She took unto herself most everything her lover lost
# Now the master of this landscape, he was standing at the view
# With a sparrow of St. Francis that he was preaching to
# She beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood
# She said, "I'll make a place between my legs, I'll teach you solitude."
# He offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room
# He promiised her protection for the issue of her womb
# She moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon
# She stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon
# She took his much admired Oriental frame of mind
# And the heart-of-darkness alibi his money hides behind
# She took his blonde madonna and his monastery wine
# "This mental space is occupied and everything is mine."
# He tried to make a final stand beside the railway track
# She said, "The art of longing's over and it's never coming back."
# She took his tavern parliament, his cap, his cocky dance
# She mocked his female fashions and his working-class moustache
# The last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get
# A woman's education, but he's not a woman yet
# And the last time that I saw her she was living with a boy
# Who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy
# So the great affair is over, but whoever would have guessed
# It would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed
# It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star
> Leonard Cohen
# It's coming through a hole in the air
# >From those nights in Tiananmen Square
# It's coming from the feel
# That it ain't exactly real
# Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there

# >From the sirens night and day
# >From the fires of the homeless
# >From the ashes of the gay
# Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.
# It's coming through a crack in the wall
# On a visionary flood of alcohol
# >From the staggering account
# Of the Sermon on the Mount
# Which I don't pretend to understand at all
# It's coming from the silence
# On the dock of the bay
# >From the brave, the bold, the battered
# Heart of Chevrolet
# Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.
# It's coming from the sorrow on the street
# The holy places where the races meet
# >From the homicidal bitchin'
# That goes down in every kitchen
# To determine who will serve and who will eat
# >From the wells of disappointment
# Where the women kneel to pray
# For the grace of God in the desert here
# And the desert far away
# Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.
# CHORUS
# Sail on, sail on
# O mighty Ship of State!
# To the Shores of Need
# Past the Reefs of Greed
# Through the Squalls of Hate
# Sail on, sail on, sail on...
# It's coming to America first
# The cradle of the best and of the worst
# It's here they got the range
# And the machinery for change
# And it's here they got the spiritual thirst
# It's here the family's broken
# And it's here the lonely say
# That the heart has got to open
# In a fundamental way
# Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.
# It's coming from the women and the men
# O baby, we'll be making love again
# We'll be going down so deep
# That the river's going to weep
# And the mountain's going to shout amen!
# It's coming like the tidal flood
# Beneath the lunar sway
# Imperial, mysterious
# In amorous array
# Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.
# CHORUS
# I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean
# I love the country but I can't stand the scene
# And I'm neither left or right
# I'm just staying home tonight
# Getting lost in that hopeless little screen
# But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags
# That time cannot decay
# I'm junk but I'm still holding up
# This little wild bouquet
# Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.
> Leonard Cohen
# I was born in a beauty salon
# My father was a dresser of hair
# My mother was a girl you could call on
# When you called she was always there
# CHORUS
# But don't go home with your hard-on
# It will only drive you insane
# You can't shake it (or break it) with your Motown
# You can't melt it down in the rain
# I've looked behind all of the faces
# That smile you down to your knees
# And the lips that say, come on, taste us
# And when you try to, they make you say please
# Here comes your bride with her veil on
# Approach her, you wretch, if you dare
# Approach her, you ape with your tail on
# Once you have her she'll always be there
# So I work in that same beauty salon
# I'm chained to the old masquerade
# The lipstick, the shadow, the silicone
# I follow my father's trade
# CHORUS
> Leonard Cohen
# I touched you once too often
# Now I don't know who I am
# My fingerprints were missing
# When I wiped away the jam
# I called my fingerprints all night
# But they don't seem to care
# The last time that I saw them
# They were leafing through your hair
# CHORUS
# Fingerprints, fingerprints
# Where are you now, my fingerprints?
# I thought I'd leave this morning
# So I emptied out your drawer
# A hundred thousand fingerprints
# Floated to the floor
# You hardly stopped to pick them up
# Yo udon't care what you lose
# You don't even seem to know
# Whose fingerprints are whose
# CHORUS
# And now you want to marry me
# And take me down the aisle
# And throw confetti fingerprints
# You know that's not my style
# Oh, sure, I'd like to marry you
# But I can't face the dawn
# With any girl who knew me
# When my fingerprints were on
# CHORUS
> Leonard Cohen
# Now I've heard there was a secret chord
# That David played, and it pleased the Lord
# But you don't really care for music, do you?
# It goes like this
# The fourth, the fifth
# The minor fall, the major lift
# The baffled king composing Hallelujah
# Hallelujah
# Hallelujah
# Hallelujah
# Hallelujah
# Your faith was strong but you needed proof
# You saw her bathing on the roof
# Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
# She tied you
# To a kitchen chair
# She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
# And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# You say I took the name in vain
# I don't even know the name
# But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
# There's a blaze of light
# In every word
# It doesn't matter which you heard
# The holy or the broken Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# I did my best, it wasn't much
# I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
# I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
# And even though
# It all went wrong
# I'll stand before the Lord of Song
# With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# Hallelujah, Hallelujah

# I loved you in the morning
# Our kisses deep and warm,
# Your head upon the pillow
# Like a sleepy golden Strom.
# Yes, many loved before us
# I know that we are not new,
# In city and in forest
# They smiled like me and you,
# But now it's come to distances
# And both of us must try,
# Your eyes are soft with sorrow,
# Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.
# I'm not looking for another
# As I wander in my time,
# Walk me to the corner
# Our steps will always rhyme,
# You know my love goes with you
# As your love stays with me,
# It's just the way it changes
# Like the shoreline and the sea,
# But let's not talk of love or chains
# And things we can't untie,
# Your eyes are soft with sorrow,
# Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.
# I loved you in the morning
# Our kisses deep and warm,

# Like a sleepy golden Strom.
# Yes, many loved before us

# But let's not talk of love or chains

# I need you, I knew I was in danger
# Of losing what I used to think was mine
# You let me love you till I was a failure
# Your beauty on my bruise like iodine
# I asked you if a man could be forgiven
# And though I failed at love, was this a crime?
# You said, don't worry, don't worry, darling
# There are many ways a man can serve his time
# You covered up that place I could not master
# It wasn't dark enough to shut my eyes
# So I was with you, oh sweet compassion
# Compassion with the sting of iodine
# Your saintly kisses reeked of iodine
# Your fragrance with fume of iodine
# And pity in the room like iodine
# Your sister fingers burned like iodine
# And all my wanton lust was iodine
# My masquerade of trust was iodine
# And everywhere the flare of iodine
> Leonard Cohen
# She stands before you naked
# You can see it, you can taste it
# But she comes to you light as the breeze
# You can drink or you can nurse it
# It don't matter how you worship
# As long as you're
# Down on your knees
# So I knelt there at the delta
# At the alpha and the omega
# At the cradle of the river and the seas
# And like a blessing come from heaven
# For something like a second
# I was healed and my heart
# Was at ease
# CHORUS
# O baby I waited
# So long for your kiss
# For something to happen
# Oh something like this
# And you're weak and you're harmless
# And you're sleeping in your harness
# And the wind going wild
# In the trees
# And it's not exactly prison
# But you'll never be forgiven
# For whatever you've done
# With the keys
# It's dark and it's snowing
# O my love I must be going
# St. Lawrence River
# Is starting to freeze
# ANd I'm sick of pretending
# I'm broken from bending
# I've lived too long on my knees
# Then she dances so graceful
# And your heart's hard and hateful
# And she's naked
# But that's just a tease
# And you turn in disgust
# >From your hatred and from your love
# And she comes to you
# Light as the breeze
# CHORUS
# There's blood on every bracelet
# You can see it, you can taste it
# And it's please baby
# Please baby please
# And she says, drink deepy pilgrim
# But don't forget there's still a woman
# Beneath this
# Resplendent chemise
# So I knelt there at the delta
# At the alpha and the omega
# I knelt there like one who believes
# And like a blessing come from heaven
# For something like a second
# I was cured and my heart
# Was at ease
> Leonard Cohen
# I believe that you heard your master sing
# When I was sick in bed
# I suppose that he told you everything
# That I keep locked away in my head
# Your master took you traveling
# Well, at least that's what you said
# And now do you come back to bring
# Your prisoner wine and bread
# You met him at some temple
# Where they take your clothes at the door
# He was just a numberless man in a chair
# Who had just come back from the war
# And you wrap up his tired face in your hair
# And he hands you the apple core
# Then he touches your lips, now so suddenly bare
# Of all the kisses we put on sometime before
# And he gave you a German shepherd to walk
# With a collar of leather and nails
# And he never once made you explain or talk
# About all of the little details
# Such as who had a worm and who had a rock
# And who had you through the mails
# Now you love is a secret all over the block
# And it never stops not even
# When your master fails
# And he took you up in his aeroplane
# Which he flew without any hands
# And you cruised above the ribbons of rain
# That drove the crowds from the stands
# Then he killed the lights in a lonely lane
# And an ape with angel glands
# Erased the final wisps of pain
# With the music of rubber bands
# And now I hear you master sing
# You kneel for him to come
# His body is a golden string
# That your body is hanging from
# His body is a golden string
# My body has grown numb
# O now you hear you master sing
# Your shirt is all undone
# And will you kneel beside this bed
# That we polished so long ago
# Before you master chose instead
# To make my bed of snow
# Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red
# And you are speaking far too low
# No, I can't make out what your master said
# Before he made you go
# And I think you're playing far too rough
# For a lady who's been to the moon
# I've lain by this window long enough
# You get used to an empty room
# And your love is some dust
# In an old man's cuff
# Who is tapping his foot to a rune
# And your highs are a ruin
# you want too much
# Let's say you came back sometime too soon
# I loved your master perfectly
# And I taught him all that he knew
# He was starving in some deep mystery
# Like a man who is sure what is true
# And I sent you to him with my guarantee
# I could teach him something new
# And I taught him how you would long for me
# No matter what he said, no matter what you do
# I believe that you heard you master sing
# While I was sick in bed
# I'm sure that he told you everything
# I must keep locked away in my head
# Your master took you traveling
# Well, at least that's what you said
# And now do you come back to bring
# Your prisoner wine and bread.
> Leonard Cohen
# Frankie Laine was singing Jezebel
# I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel
# I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
# I said, look, you don't know me now
# But very soon you will
# So won't you let me see
# Won't you let me see
# Won't you let me see
# Your naked body
# Just dance me to the dark side of the gym
# Chances are I'll let you do most anything
# I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
# They're many parts of me to touch, you have your choice
# But no you cannot see
# No you cannot see
# No you cannot see
# My naked body
# We are dancing close, the band is playing "Stardust"
# Balloons and paper streamers floating down on us
# She says, you've got a minute left to fall in love
# In solemn moments such as this I've put my trust
# And all my faith to see
# All my faith to see
# All my faith to see
# Her naked body
> Leonard Cohen
# I built my house beside the wood
# So I could hear you singing
# And it was sweet and it was good
# And love was all beginning
# Fare thee well my nightingale
# 'Twas long ago I found you
# Now all your songs of beauty fail
# The forest closes 'round you
# The sun goes down behind a veil
# 'Tis now that you would call me
# So rest in peace my nightingale
# Beneath your branch of holly
# Fare thee well my nightingale
# I lived but to be near you
# Tho' you are singing somewhere still
# I can no longer hear you
> Leonard Cohen
# Some people say
# It's what we deserve
# For sins against g-d
# For crimes in the world
# I wouldn't know
# I'm just holding the fort
# Since that day
# They wounded New York
# Some people say
# They hate us of old
# Our women unveiled
# Our slaves and our gold
# I wouldn't know
# I'm just holding the fort
# But answer me this
# I won't take you to court
# Did you go crazy
# Or did you report
# On that day
# On that day
# They wounded New York
> Leonard Cohen
# The walls of this hotel are paper thin
# Last night I heard you making love to him
# The struggle mouth to mouth and limb to limb
# The grunt of unity when he came in
# I stood there with my ear against the wall
# I was not seized by jealousy at all
# In fact a burden lifted from my soul
# I heard that love was out of my control
# A heavy burden lifted from my soul
# I learned that love was out of my control
# I listened to your kisses at the door
# I never heard the world so clear before
# You ran your bath and you began to sing
# I felt so good I couldn't feel a thing
# And I can't wait to tell you to your face
# And I can't wait for you to take my place
# You are the Naked Angel in My Heart
# You are the Woman with Her Legs Apart
# It's written on the walls of this hotel
# You go to heaven once you've been to hell
# A heavy burden lifted from my soul
# I heard that love was out of my control
> Leonard Cohen
# O the sisters of mercy they are not
# Departed or gone,
# They were waiting for me when I thought
# That I just can't go on,
# And they brought me their comfort
# And later they brought me this song.
# O I hope you run into them
# You who've been traveling so long.
# Yes, you who must leave everything
# That you cannot control;
# It begins with your family,
# But soon it comes round to your soul.
# Well, I've been where you're hanging
# I think I can see how you're pinned.
# When you're not feeling holy,
# Your loneliness says that you've sinned.
# Well they lay down beside me
# I made my confession to them.
# They touched both my eyes
# And I touched the dew on their hem.
# If your life is a leaf
# That the seasons tear off and condemn
# They will bind you with love
# That is graceful and green as a stem.
# When I left they were sleeping,
# I hope you run into them soon.
# Don't turn on the light
# You can read their address by the moon;
# And you won't make me jealous
# If I hear that they sweeten your night
# We weren't lovers like that
# And besides it would still be all right
# We weren't lovers like that
# And besides it would still be all right.
> Leonard Cohen
# Come over to the window, my little darling,
# I'd like to try to read you palm
# I used to think I was some kind of gypsy boy
# Before I let you take me home.
# Chorus: So long Marianne, it's time that we began
# to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again
# Well, you know that I love to live with you,
# But you make me forget so very much
# I forget to pray for the angel
# And then the angels forget to pray for us.
# Chorus
# We met when we were almost young
# Deep in the green lilac park
# You held on to me like I was a crucifix
# As we went kneeling through the dark.
# Chorus
# Your letters say that you are beside me now
# Then why do I feel alone?
# I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
# Is fastening my ankle to a stone.
# Chorus
# For now I need your hidden love
# I'm cold as a new razor blade
# You left when I told you I was curious
# I never said that I was brave.
# Chorus
# O you are really such a pretty one
# I see you've gone and changed your name again
# And just when I climbed this whole mountainside
# To wash my eyelids in the rain.
# Chorus
> Leonard Cohen
# The stories of the street are mine
# The Spanish voices laugh
# The Cadillacs go creeping down
# Through the night and the poison gas
# I lean from mu window sill
# In this old hotel I chose.
# Yes, one hand on my suicide
# And one hand on the rose.
# I know you've heard it's over now
# And war must surely come,
# The cities they are broke in half
# And the middle men are gone.
# But let me ask you one more time
# O children of the dust,
# These hunters who are shrieking now
# Do they speak for us?
# And where do all these highways go
# Now that we are free?
# Why are the armies marching still
# That were coming home to me?
# O lady with your legs so fine
# O stranger at your wheel
# You are locked into your suffering
# And your pleasures are the seal.
# The age of lust is giving birth
# But both the parents ask the nurse
# To tell them fairy tales on both sides of the glass
# Now the infant with his cord
# is hauled in like a kite
# And one eye filled with blueprints
# One eye filled with night
# O come with me my little one
# And we will find that farm
# And grow us grass and apples there
# To keep all the animals warm
# And if by chance I wake at night
# And I ask you who I am
# O take me to the slaughter house
# I will wait there with the lamb.
# With one hand on a hexagram
# And one hand on a girl
# I balance on a wishing well
# That all men call the world
# We are so small between the stars
# So large against the sky
# And lost among the subway crowds
# I try to catch your eye.
> Leonard Cohen
# Suzanne takes you down to her place newer the river
# You can hear the boats go by
# You can spend the night beside her
# And you know that she's half crazy
# But that's why you want to be there
# And she feeds you tea and oranges
# That come all the way from China
# And just when you mean to tell her
# That you have no love to give her
# Then she gets you on her wavelength
# And she lets the river answer
# That you've always been her lover
# And you want to travel with her
# And you want to travel blind
# And you know that she will trust you
# For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.
# And Jesus was a sailor
# when he walked upon the water
# And he spent a long time watching
# From his lonely wooden tower
# And when he knew for certain
# Only drowning men could see him
# He said "all men will be sailors then
# Until the sea shall free them"
# But he himself was broken
# Long before the sky would open
# Forsaken, almost human
# He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
# And you want to travel with him
# And you want to travel blind
# And you think maybe you'll trust him
# For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.
# Now Suzanne takes you hand
# And she leads you to the river
# She is wearing rags and feathers
# From Salvation Army counters
# And the sun pours down like honey
# On our lady of the harbour
# And she shows you where to look
# Among the garbage and the flowers
# There are heroes in the seaweed
# There are children in the morning
# They are leaning out for love
# and they will lean that way forever
# While Suzanne holds the mirror
# And you want to travel with her
# And you want to travel blind
# And you know that she will trust you
# For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.
> Leonard Cohen
# I met a woman long ago
# Her hair the black that black can go
# Are you a teacher of the heart
# Soft she answered No.
# I met a girl across the sea
# Her hair the gold that gold can be
# Are you a teacher of the heart
# Yes but not for thee.
# I met a man who lost his mind
# In some lost place I had to find
# Follow me the wise man said
# But he walked behind.
# I walked into a hospital
# Where none was sick and none was well
# When at night the nurses left
# I could not walk at all.
# Morning came
# and then came noon
# Dinner time the scalpel blade
# Lay beside my silver spoon
# Some girls wander by mistake
# Into the mess that scalpels make
# Are you the teachers of my heart
# We teach old hearts to break.
# One morning I woke up alone
# The hospital, the nurses gone
# Have I carved enough, my lord
# Child, you are bone.
# I ate and ate and ate,
# No, I did not miss a plate
# Well, how much do these suppers cost
# We'll take it out in hate.
# I spent my hatred every place
# On every work on every face
# Someone gave me wishes
# And I wished for an embrace.
# Several girls embraced me,
# Then I was embraced by men
# Is my passion perfect
# No, do it once again.
# I was handsome, I was strong
# I knew the words of every song
# Did my singing please you
# No, the words you sang were wrong.
# Who is it whom I address
# Who takes down what I confess
# Are you the teachers of my heart
# We teach old hearts to rest.
# Well, teachers are my lessons done
# I cannot do another one
# They laughed and laughed and said
# Well, child are your lessons done.
# Are your lessons done
# Are your lessons done.

# The sea so deep and blind
# The sun, the wild regret
# The club, the wheel, the mind,
# O love, aren't you tired yet?
# The club, the wheel, the mind
# O love, aren't you tired yet?
# The blood, the soil, the faith
# These words you can't forget
# Your vow, your holy place
# O love, aren't you tired yet?
# The blood, the soil, the faith
# O love, aren't you tired yet?
# A cross on every hill
# A star, a minaret
# So many graves to fill
# O love, aren't you tired yet?
# So many graves to fill
# O love, aren't you tired yet?
# The sea so deep and blind
# Where still the sun must set
# And time itself unwind
# O love, aren't you tired yet?
# And time itself unwind
# O love, aren't you tired yet?
> Leonard Cohen
# Give me back my broken night
# My secret room, my secret life
# It's lonely here
# There's no one left to torture
# Give me absolute control
# Over every living soul
# And lie beside me, baby
# That's an order!
# Give me crack and anal sex
# Take the only tree that's left
# And stuff it up the hole
# In your culture
# Give back the Berlin Wall
# Give me Stalin and St. Paul
# I've seen the future, brother
# It is murder
# CHORUS
# Things are going to slide in all directions
# Won't be nothing
# Nothing you can measure anymore
# The blizzard of the world
# Has crossed the threshold
# And it has overturned
# The order of the soul
# When they said repent
# I wonder what they meant
# When they said repent
# I wonder what they meant
# When they said repent
# I wonder what they meant
# You don't know me from the wind
# You never will, you never did
# I'm the little Jew
# Who wrote the Bible
# I've seen nations rise and fall
# I've heard their stories, heard them all
# But love's the only engine of survival
# Your servant here, he has been told
# To say it clear, to say it cold
# It's over, it ain't going
# Any further
# And now the wheels of heaven stop
# You feel the devil's riding crop
# Get ready for the future
# It is murder
# CHORUS
# There'll be the breaking of the ancient
# Western code
# Your private life will suddenly explode
# There'll be phantoms
# There'll be fires in the road
# And the white man dancing
# You'll see the woman
# Hanging upside down
# Her features covered by her fallen gown
# And all the lousy little poets
# Coming round
# Trying to sound like Charlie Manson
# Give me back the Berlin Wall
# Give me Stalin and St. Paul
# Give me Christ
# Or give me Hiroshima
# Destroy another fetus now
# We don't like children anyhow
# I've seen the future, baby
# It is murder
# CHORUS
> Leonard Cohen
# It's true that all the men you knew were dealers
# who said they were through with dealing
# Every time you gave them shelter
# I know that kind of man
# It's hard to hold the hand of anyone
# who is reaching for the sky just to surrender.
# And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
# you find he did not leave you very much
# not even laughter
# Like any dealer he was watching for the card
# that is so high and wild
# he'll never need to deal another
# He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
# He was just some Joseph looking for a manger.
# And then leaning on your window sill
# he'll say one day you caused his will
# to weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
# And then taking from his wallet
# an old schedule of trains, he'll say
# I told you when I came I was a stranger
# I told you when I came I was a stranger.
# But now another stranger seems to want you to ignore his dreams
# as though they were the burden of some other
# O you've seen that man before
# his golden arm dispatching cards
# but now it's rusted from the elbow to the finger
# And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
# Yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter.
# You hate to watch another tired man
# lay down his hand
# like he was giving up the holy game of poker
# And while he talks his dreams to sleep
# you notice there's a highway
# that is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
# It's curling up like smoke above his shoulder.
# You tell him to come in sit down
# but something makes you turn around
# The door is open you can't close you shelter
# You try the handle of the road
# It opens do not be afraid
# It's you my love, you who are the stranger
# It is you my love, you who are the stranger.
# Well, I've been waiting, I was sure
# we'd meet between the trains we're waiting for
# I think it's time to board another
# Please understand, I never had a secret chart
# to get me to the heart of this
# or any other matter
# Well he talks like this
# you don't know what he's after
# When he speaks like this,
# you don't know what he's after.
# Let's meet tomorrow if you chose
# upon the shore, beneath the bridge
# that they are building on some endless river
# Then he leaves the platform
# for the sleeping car that's warm
# You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
# And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
# And you say ok the bridge or someplace later.
# And then sweeping up the jokers
# that he left behind
# you find he did not leave you very much
# not even laughter
# Like any dealer he was watching for the card
# that is so high and wild
# he'll never need to deal another
# He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
# He was just some Joseph looking for a manger.
# And leaning on your window sill
# he'll say one day you caused his will
# to weaken with your love and warmth and shelter

# an old schedule of trains
# he'll say I told you when I came I was a stranger
# I told you when I came I was a stranger.

# Hurt once and for all into silence.
# A long pain ending without a song to prove it.
# Who could stand beside you so close to Eden,
# When you glinted in every eye the held-high
# razor, shivering every ram and son?
# And now the silent loony bin, where
# The shadows live in the rafters like
# Day-weary bats,
# Until the turning mind, a radar signal,
# lures them to exaggerate
# Mountain-size on the white stone wall
# Your tiny limp.
# How can I leave you in such a house?
# Are there no more saints and wizards
# to praise their ways with pupils,
# No more evil to stun with the slap
# of a wet red tongue?
# Did you confuse the Messiah in a mirror
# and rest because he had finally come?
# Let me cry Help beside you, Teacher.
# I have entered under this dark roof
# As fearlessly as an honoured son
# Enters his father's house.
> Leonard Cohen
# As the mist leaves no scar
# On the dark green hill
# So my body leaves no scar
# On you and never will
# Through windows in the dark
# The children come, the children go
# Like arrows with no target
# LIke shackles made of snow
# CHORUS
# True love leaves no traces
# If you and I are one
# It's lost in our embraces
# Like stars agains the sun
# As a falling leaf may rest
# A moment on the air
# So your head upon my breast
# So my hand upon your hair
# And many nights endure
# Without a moon or star
# So will we endure
# When one is gone and far
# CHORUS
> Leonard Cohen
# From bitter searching of the heart,
# Quickened with passion and with pain
# We rise to play a greater part.
# This is the faith from which we start:
# Men shall know commonwealth again
# From bitter searching of the heart.
# We loved the easy and the smart,
# But now, with keener hand and brain,
# We rise to play a greater part.
# The lesser loyalties depart,
# And neither race nor creed remain
# From bitter searching of the heart.
# Not steering by the venal chart
# That tricked the mass for private gain,
# We rise to play a greater part.
# Reshaping narrow law and art
# Whose symbols are the millions slain,
# From bitter searching of the heart
# We rise to play a greater part.

# Baby, I've been waiting
# I've been waiting night and day
# I didn't see the time
# I waited half my life away
# There were many invitations
# And I know you sent me some
# But I was waiting
# For the miracle to come
# I know you really loved me
# But, you see, my hands were tied
# I know it must have hurt you
# It must have hurt your pride
# To stand beneath my window
# With your bugle and your drum
# While I was waiting
# For the miracle to come
# You wouldn't like it baby
# You wouldn't like it here
# There's not much entertainment
# And the critics are severe
# The Maestro says it's Mozart
# But it sounds like bubble gum
# When you're waiting
# For the miracle to come
# CHORUS
# Waiting for the miracle
# There's nothing left to do
# I haven't been this happy
# Since the end of World War II
# Nothing left to do
# When you know that you've been taken
# Nothing left to do
# When you're begging for a crumb
# Nothing left to do
# When you've got to go on waiting
# For the miracle to come
# I dreamed about you, baby
# It was just the other night
# Most of you was naked
# But some of you was light
# The sands of time were falling
# >From your fingers and your thumb
# And you were waiting
# For the miracle to come
# Baby, let's get married
# We've been alone too long
# Let's be alone together
# Let's see if we're that strong
# Let's do something crazy
# Something absolutely wrong
# While we're waiting
# For the miracle to come
# CHORUS
# When you've fallen on the highway
# And you're lying in the rain
# And they ask you how you're feeling
# Of course you say you can't complain
# If you're squeezed for information
# That's when you've got to play it dumb
# You just say you're out there waiting
# For the miracle to come

# Traveling lady stay awhile
# Until the night is over
# I'm just a station on your way
# I know I am not your lover.
# Well, I lived with a child of snow
# When I was a soldier
# And I fought every man for her
# Until the nights grew colder.
# She used to wear her hair like you
# Except when she was sleeping
# And then she'd weave it on a loom
# Of smoke and gold and breathing.
# And why are you so quiet now
# Standing there in the doorway?
# You chose your journey long before
# You came upon this highway.
# Traveling lady stay awhile
# Until the night is over
# I'm just a station on your way

# We took some salty bacon and a hammock for a bed.
# Then we mixed it with the Spaniards in the middle of the Med.
# Well we hired our funds
# Saw the pretty girls a comin'.
# There wasn't quite as many as there was a while ago
# We hired some more and then we started runnin'

# Well cannon balls flew and the ship began to sink,
# The water started risin' so we really had to think.
# And then by chance stood a man as black as coal
# So we grabbed him by the trousers and we plugged hin in the hole.
# Sing Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico
# Well we fired from the side port and we fired from the back
# And then we fired from the galley and through every little crack.
# We fired so much that the cook started cooking.
# Didn't have to worry so we flew the union jack.

# Chorus:
# Veronica's the song that's in my head
# Veronica's the name I've often said
# But her friends say she's too good for me
# It's kinda like west side story
# She's the only one for me
# She's the only girl I see
# I can't seem to find a damn thing wrong with her
# Veronica
# Verse 1:
# Every day I see your friends talkin' about me
# But I know there's something there that no one can see
# It reminds me of Romeo and Juliet
# Like we're living on a movie set
# Montague and Capulet
# Make your daddy sweat
# Because he wishes we had never met
# She says that I just make her world round
# God knows I feel it too,
# I'm so in love, I'm so in love, I'm so in love with you...
# Chorus
# Your brothers say, it's over now they're looking for me
# But I know there's something there that no one can see
# It reminds me of Romeo and Juliet
# Like were living on a movie set
# I'm a shark and youre a jet
# Make your mommy sweat
# Cause she wishes we had never met
# She says I just make her world go round
# I know 'cause I feel it too, I'm so in love with you
# Veronica
# Chorus:
# Rap:
# check-check-check-check-uhhh
# Johnny rocket, got her number in my pocket
# We was on the run, daddy got a gun, stop it!
# Playin' with veronica, she's got me now
# But her brother got a biscuit and it might go pow
# I'm shaking-to break in-and makin'-and bakin'-to do-
# Wit'cha and yo crew-and ain't doin-nothing
# But-grabbin a mic-and I'm smackin a mic
# And I'm still on beat
# You can't stop the blood rush and you can't stop love
# So it's time to knuckle up and pray to the lord above
# She says that I just make the world go round
# God knows I feel it too, I'm so in love with you
# Chorus (x3)

# Saw her on a Friday outside some rundown saloon
# She was cryin' over someone that she felt left much too soon
# I said, "hey girl don't you cry tonight, let me take you out on this town"
# She looked at me and smiled as one last tear splashed off the ground
# With half a wink she asked me, "what are you, some kind of creep?"
# I told her, "no, I guess I just feel your vibe is kinda deep"
# The moon hung over SoHo and I counted 16 stars
# I pointed to the brightest one and said, "now that one's ours"
# She's a dandelion, up on a hill above the sea
# She's not exactly everything I thought that she might be
# She's a dandelion, she looks like everything I need
# I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
# Then I hold on, hold on, hold on
# Hold on, hold on, hold on
# She just might be poison, but I took her to my roof top
# I said, "are you afraid of heights?", she said, "no, I am not"
# I said, "hey girl, don't you lie to me, tell me everything you feel"
# We danced around in circles, she said, "I think we found something real"
# She's a dandelion, up on a hill above the sea
# She's not exactly everything I thought that she might be
# She's a dandelion, she looks like everything I need
# I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
# Then I hold on, hold on, hold on
# Hold on, hold on, hold on
# Down in Union Square, I saw her walking all alone
# I walked a little slower just so I'd remain unknown
# She met someone on 17th that she knew him all too well
# My little peice of heaven has a secret she won't tell
# With half a smile she took his hand and then they walked away
# I realized I wouldn't see my girl after today
# I fell in love with a dandelion and she's all I ever had
# At first she looked so sweet but in the end she tastes so bad
# She's a dandelion, up on a hill above the sea
# She's not exactly everything I thought that she might be
# She's a dandelion, she looks like everything I need
# I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
# Then I hold on, hold on, hold on
# Hold on, hold on, hold on
# She's a dandelion, up on a hill above the sea
# She's not exactly everything I thought that she might be
# She's a dandelion, she looks like everything I need
# I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
# Then I hold on, hold on, hold on
# Hold on, hold on, hold on

# I said lets talk about it
# As she walked out on me and slammed the door
# But I just laugh about it
# 'Cause she's always playin' those games
# Deep down I know she loves me
# But she's got a funny way of showin' me how she
# cares
# Last night she did a doughnut on my lawn
# And drove out with her finger in the air
# Oh, yeah
# Sometimes its black
# Sometimes its white
# Sometimes she's wrong
# Sometimes I'm right
# Sometimes we talk about it
# Or we figure it out
# But then she'll just change her mind
# Sometimes she's hot
# Sometimes I'm cold
# Sometimes my head wants to explode
# But when I think about it
# I'm so in love with her
# Every other time
# Yeah, every other time
# Sometimes we sit around
# Just the two of us on the park bench
# Sometimes we swim around
# Like the dolphins in the ocean of our hearts
# But then I think about the time
# When we broke up before the prom
# And you told everyone that I was gay, OK
# Sometimes I walk around the town
# For hours just to settle down
# But I take you back and you kick me down
# 'Cause that's the way, uh-huh uh-huh, I like it
# Sometimes its black
# Sometimes its white
# Sometimes she's wrong
# Sometimes I'm right
# Sometimes we talk about it
# Or we figure it out
# But then she'll just change her mind
# Sometimes she's hot
# Sometimes I'm cold
# Sometimes my head wants to explode
# But when I think about it
# I'm so in love with her
# Every other time
# Yeah, every other time
# Every other time
# Keep it up homegirl
# Don't you quit
# You know
# The way you scream is the ultimate
# And when I
# Walk away just watch the clock
# I bet I
# Don't even get around the block
# I said let's talk about it
# As she walked out on me and slammed the door
# One day we'll laugh about it
# 'Cause we're always playin' those games
# Every other time
# Sometimes its black
# Sometimes its white
# Sometimes she's wrong
# Sometimes I'm right
# Sometimes we talk about it
# Or we figure it out

# Oooh
# Yeah
# I'm wishing on a falling star
# Wondering where you are
# I wish
# Wish for you on a falling star
# Wondering where you are
# Do I ever cross your mind
# In the warm sunshine
# She's from, the city of angels
# Like Brady Davis, James Dean and Gable
# Never know what she means to me
# I fell for the girl that's on TV
# Met her at a counter affair
# She wore a green dress & every body was there
# Felt out of place till she looked into my eyes
# Shook your hand around 9 p.m.
# And I, never thought I'd be the same again
# Never had to be on a movie screen
# To be the lady in all my dreams
# Shooby doo-wap & scooby snacks
# Met a fly girl and I can't relax
# The only problem is she's a movie star
# Oh oh
# My friends they won't believe me
# If they could only see me
# At the risk of sounding cheezy
# Think I fell for the girl on TV
# Wish for you on a falling star
# Wondering where you are
# Do I ever cross your mind
# In the warm sunshine
# She's from, the city of angels
# Like Brady Davis, James Dean and Gable
# Never know what she means to me
# I fell for the girl that's on TV
# Everybody knows her name
# Wanna take a picture and their glad she came
# But I just want to be there when she's down
# Down (Be there when she's down)
# I don't want her autograph
# I just want to call her up and make it hap
# Never had to be on a movie screen
# To be the leading lady in all my dreams
# Shooby doo-wap & scooby snacks
# Met a fly girl and I can't relax
# The only problem is she's a movie star
# Oh oh
# My friends they won't believe me
# If they could only see me
# At the risk of sounding cheezy
# Think I fell for the girl on TV
# Wish for you on a falling star
# Wondering where you are
# Do I ever cross your mind
# In the warm sunshine
# She's from, the city of angels
# Like Brady Davis, James Dean and Gable
# Never know what she means to me
# I fell for the girl that's on TV
# (I wish for you on a falling star)
# I'm wishing on a star
# And I'm wondering where you are
# (Wondering where you are)
# Do I cross your mind
# In the warm sunshine
# (Rap)
# So I wish for you on a bright shining star
# Every where I look there you are
# Its the girl in the green dress
# She took my breath away
# And now I look to the sky
# For a better day
# To the beach shore and scooby snacks
# I met a fly girl and I can't relax
# Never had to  be on a movie screen
# Cuz she's the leading lady in all my dreams
# I wish
# Wish for you on a falling star
# Wondering where you are
# Do I ever cross your mind
# In the warm sunshine
# She's from, the city of angels
# Like Brady Davis, James Dean and Gable
# Never know what she means to me
# I fell for the girl that's on TV

# Wondering where you are

# Ooh
# I can't believe the night is gone
# Now its time to take you home
# Girl as you come in close to give me one last kiss
# You're making it hard to be so me
# Don't want to leave you like this no
# Cause
# I don't want to kiss you good-night
# If a kiss means this night is over
# I don't want to have to say good bye no no no

# When this night could lead to so much more
# I wanna hold you (hold you)
# I wanna touch you (touch you)
# Don't want to kiss you
# Don't want to kiss you goodnight
# I used to see you in my dreams
# (Hoping one day they'd come true)
# And then you gave yourself to me
# But now we're standing here and I'm holding you
# And this never felt so right
# Don't want to leave you here
# Can I come inside
# And kiss you where you like
# I don't want to kiss you good-night
# If a kiss means this night is over
# I don't want to have to say good bye no no no
# Girl don't leave me standing at your door

# I'd take my time to make you breathless
# Girl we can do it again and again
# I don't want to kiss you good-night
# If a kiss means this night is over
# I don't want to have to say good bye no no no

# It's only you I see
# Its driving me crazy
# Only got a one track mind
# Thinking about the way your body moves
# When you go by
# It was making me want you
# (Get me hooked up)
# Think (I think about you)
# About (I think about you)

# You (All the time girl)

# Hey girl whatcha you tryin to do
# I mean like whatcha tryin to put my body through
# Got me  tripping showing off your rose tatoo
# Right above your ankle
# What cha trying to make me do?
# Go insane
# I can't need I can't sleep all i do is fantasize
# 'Bout that look thats in your eye

# You got me thinking

# (Girl I just think of you I don't know what else to do)
# Hey girl whatcha you tryin to do
# I mean like whatcha tryin to put my body through
# I wonder if there is a chance for me
# One possibility that I could make love to you
# Instead of dreaming and hoping so hard and long
# Make it come true
# (Make it come true)
# Check this out
# I said
# (Tarajaca do me vu) tell me what you wanna do
# The world is spinning but I want to say a word to you
# She said she never had a real boyfriend
# And Mr. T Means Love don't you hurt me again
# Check the prognosis you got the style to content me
# With out you in my life I guess the whole thing would be empty
# Chicken pop love you don't stop you got me thinking
# Visualize your body as i'm thinking
# I'm thinking
# Think (Constantly I got you on my mind)
# About (I keep thinking of you all the time)
# You all of the time

# Veronica's a song thats in my head
# Veronica's a name I've often said
# But her friends say she's too good for me
# Its kinda like a west side story
# She's the only one for me
# She's the only girl I see
# Can't seem to find a damn thing wrong with her
# Veronica
# Everyday I see her friends talking 'bout me
# But I know there's something there that no one can see
# It reminds me of Romeo and Juliet
# Like we're living on a movie set
# Montague and Capulet
# Make your daddy sweat
# Cuz he wishes we had never met
# Says that I can make her world go 'round
# God knows I feel it too
# I'm so in love
# I'm so in love

# Johnny rock it
# Got her number in my pocket
# We was on the run
# Daddy got a gun
# Stop it
# Playing with veronica
# She got me now
# But her father got a biscut and it might go pow
# I'm shakin and breakin and makin and bakin and doing what she aint
# Crooning and tuning i'm dropping the mike and smacking the mike
# And i'm still gonna be
# You can't stop the gold rush and you can't stop love
# So its kinda like a love being prayed to the Lord above
# Says that I just make the world go 'round
# God knows I feel it too
# I'm so in love...with you

# From way far across the sea
# Came an eritrean maiden she
# Had a one track mind and eyes for me
# Half blinded in the war
# With a pale young Anglican
# Who said he'd help her all he can
# Showed her Jesus and his little un-holy friend
# She had no mind to please him
# Just say 'ta-ra' and leave him behind
# There's a little boy in a stairwell who says
# 'I hate people like you'
# Got matches & cable TV half of less than 50p
# We all clambered over the balcony
# Banging on the window waking Steve
# Bringing with a true love his un-holy friend
# If you really need it
# You just won't leave it behind
# So baby please kill me
# Oh baby don't kill me
# But don't bring that ghost round to my door
# I don't wanna see him anymore
# Please kill me
# Oh baby don't kill me
# Just don't bang on about yesterday
# I wouldn't know about that anyway
# Monkey asked the mouse before
# If she loved anybody more than he
# It turns you into stone
# Now I'm reversing down the lonely street
# To a cheap hotel when I can meet the past
# And pay it off and keep it sweet

# That does as I wish
# But when I get downtown
# And see what's around
# I just know there's got to be
# A better place to be found
# I said oh, come on baby, oh, come on
# The river runs red and I think I'm dyin'
# Well I knew there'd come a day
# When my mind would say "Hey are you afraid"
# Well all I know is that I been down here tryin'
# Well, I'll bleed on through the night
# I suppose I'll be dead by the morning light
# No don't be surprised if you mind when you find me
# The river runs red and I think I'm dyin'

# It disturbs me to see that you're growing old.
# It concerns me to be the one you want to hold.
# Too busy running on fuel, thank God you made it through.
# Let's spend the times we've missed and turn these days to gold.
# Too busy running on fuel, thank God you made it through.

# Lost as father and son.

# Seasons change and so did your son.
# Strife with emotions that can't be one.

# Quando tutte le parole sai che non ti servon più
# quando sudi il tuo coraggio per non startene laggiù
# quando tiri in mezzo Dio o il destino o chissà che
# che nessuno se lo spiega perch? sia successo a te
# quando tira un pò di vento che ci si rialza un pò
# e la vita è un pò più forte del tuo dirle "grazie no"
# quando sembra tutto fermo la tua ruota girerà.
# Sopra il giorno di dolore che uno ha.
# Tu tu tu tu tu tu...
# Quando indietro non si torna quando l'hai capito che
# che la vita non è giusta come la vorresti te
# quando farsi una ragione vora dire vivere
# te l'han detto tutti quanti che per loro è facile
# quando batte un pò di sole dove ci contavi un pò
# e la vita è un pò più forte del tuo dirle "ancora no"
# quando la ferita brucia la tua pelle si farà.
# Sopra il giorno di dolore che uno ha.
# Tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu...
# Quando il cuore senza un pezzo il suo ritmo prenderà
# quando l'aria che fa il giro i tuoi polmoni beccherà
# quando questa merda intorno sempre merda resterà
# riconoscerai l'odore perch? questa è la realtà
# quando la tua sveglia suona e tu ti chiederai che or'è

# rosseggiava la città
# già nostra ed ora straniera
# incredibile e fredda;
# come un istante "deja vu"
# ombra della gioventù
# ci circondava la nebbia.
# Auto ferme ci guardavano in silenzio
# vecchi muri proponevan nuovi eroi
# dieci anni da narrare l'uno all'altro
# ma le frasi rimanevan dentro in noi
# "cosa fai ora, ti ricordi,
# eran belli i nostri tempi,
# ti ho scritto è un anno,
# mi han detto che eri ancor via".
# E poi la cena a casa sua,
# la mia nuova cortesia,
# stoviglie color nostalgia.
# E le frasi quasi fossimo due vecchi
# rincorrevan solo il tempo dentro in noi
# per la prima volta vidi quegli specchi
# capii i quadri, i soprammobili ed i suoi.
# I nostri miti morti ormai,
# la scoperta di Hemingway
# il sentirsi nuovi
# le cose sognate e poi viste
# la mia America e la sua
# diventate nella via
# la nostra città tanto triste.
# Carte e vento volan via nella stazione
# freddo e luci accese forse per noi lì
# ed infine in breve la sua situazione
# uguale quasi a tanti nostri film:
# come in un libro scritto male
# lui si era ucciso per natale
# ma il triste racconto sembrava
# assorbito dal buoi
# povera amica che narravi
# dieci anni in poche frasi
# e io i miei in un solo saluto.
# E pensavo dondolato dal vagone
# "cara amica il tempo prende il tempo dà
# noi corriamo sempre in una direzione
# ma qual sia e che senso abbia chi lo sa
# restano i sogni senza tempo
# le impressioni di un momento
# le luci nel buio

# It's like I just woke up one morning
# Looked at the way that we live
# Thought things could be so much better
# There must be better than this
# And if I relocated
# To where the grass is greener
# Maybe I'd be happy again
# But I'm a little bit disappointed
# Cos now I've got my freedom
# But I'm still looking over the fence
# It's always the same
# At the end of the day
# You always want what you haven't got
# It's like the hands on the clock stopped turning
# Right at the moment you left
# You went looking for something better
# You stopped me dead in my tracks
# It's a bittersweet emotion
# That I'm feeling baby, now you're happy again
# But I'm a little bit disappointed
# Cos now you've got your freedom
# But you're still looking over the fence
# It's always the same
# At the end of the day
# You always want what you haven't got
# It's always the same
# It won't ever change
# You always want what you haven't got
# Thought if I relocated
# To where the grass is greener
# Maybe I'd be happy again
# But I'm a little bit disappointed

# I know you feel the same way to
# And I know you feel the same as I do
# So let's put all this bullshit aside
# Spread them legs and let me inside
# [Verse 1]
# I'm cruising in a regal
# With a desert eagle
# I see this hyna jockin
# Players know I'm stoppin'
# I have to turn around
# But first I look around, I
# Have to watch my back
# I don't know where this bitches boyfriends at
# I pull up to her side and I tell her jump in
# My rolas bumpin'
# Notice something's on my mind
# You're looking fine and you know it
# You know your ass and titties look good
# Because you show 'em, I wanna hold 'em
# Kiss 'em and come and you can suck it
# I love it when a bitch trips in front of me
# Girl don't be frontin' me
# Let me see how bad you are
# Let me see how far you can take it down your throat
# Try not to choke
# You don't need to swallow
# But suck me â€˜till I'm hallow
# And then call me up tomorrow
# Oh, I'm sorry! Did I take it too far?
# If you don't wanna fuck, get the fuck up out my car
# [Verse 2]
# I love the girls that flirt
# Look at the little mini-skirt
# That she's wearin'
# I know she's lovin' it when I'm starin'
# I got my eyes on her, her eyes on me
# I guarantee later on we'll be fucking in between the sheets
# I know you feel the same way to
# Your boyfriend don't have to know what we do
# As long as no finds out and goes out
# And runs their mouth about me and you
# We can do what we do
# Whenever you want to
# Call me on the phone
# I'll show up alone
# Ready to bone
# Making you moan
# I'll take off your clothes
# And we're both getting ours
# When we're bumpin my flows
# Nobody knows like a big secret
# And that's the way I wanna keep it
# Just between me and you, you and me
# Will know what we do
# So stop acting like you don't want to
# I know you want to
# [Verse 3]
# You know I'm not the type of guy
# To sit around and watch you lie
# Know that I'm the type of guy
# I'll fuck you I ain't gon stick and die
# I'll never waste no time
# On a bitch that can't make up her mind
# It's now or never so make your choice
# I know you like my voice when you hear my tongue flip
# Picture me doing it on your clit
# Or picture me rubbing it with my dick
# Any way you like I'll give it to you quick
# Let me see your tits
# Put your nipple to my lips
# I'll kiss your whole body
# When we're acting naughty
# I love to see your body
# On top of my body
# Smoking on some yeska while we're drinking Bacardi
# When your man gets you mad, call me up and we'll party
# I know you feel the same way to
# And I know you feel the same as I do
# So let's put all this bullshit aside
# Spread them legs and let me inside

# [Chorus 2x]
# I roll slow through my city and Norwalk be the spot
# Where Lil Cuete kicks it, drinking, smoking pot
# Strolling through the One-Ways, the fun ways where I stay
# And if you got some pleto homeboy bring it my way
# [Verse 1]
# I'm nothing but the real thing and to me you ain't nothing
# So step up to me ese so I can show you something
# You know I'm always packing; I'm everything you're lacking
# And somebody like you, can't handle someone like me
# I'm never taken lightly
# And if you think I'm bluffing come and try me
# And you'll see I'm just like my click
# I'm getting crazy, amazing to be this fucking sick
# A lot of down ass vatos but your the one I picked
# To me you're just a bitch, a stupid ass lame
# Not even from a gang, just trying to claim the fame
# I'll tell you one more time, its Norwalk what I bang
# We're all sick in the mente, crazy insane
# [Verse 2]
# I'm downing fools that shit talk
# I represent the sick box
# I'm wrapping fools in zip blocks
# He had nothing but sick thoughts
# Money filled in big pots
# We're never using eye drops
# Never will our high stop
# Never will our high stop
# Bitches late at night tripping off the cloud of pipes
# Starting a gun-fight with another rival
# Shooting 'em down with a rifle
# The number One Gun is me
# Remember when you change the Q in to C
# But fuck the C I'll cross it out
# Right before I take you out
# I'm taking a trip to the beach
# And I'm throwing him off the at pier
# Fear when I'm near, no one will hear
# When I'm throwing him under
# Fool, it's the one whenever you think that I'm leaving
# I'm leaving you bleeding
# The Demon deceive 'em whenever I'm coming ahead
# Shooting them all until their dead, until their dead
# [Chorus 2x]
# Yeah...Little Peter Cuete
# If anybody got offended by this motherfucking album
# I just got one thing to say to you..
# FUCK YOU!! Huh... little gun and I'm out

# I remember one year
# My mom took me school shopping
# It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
# All hopped in the car
# We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
# My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
# I didn't say nothing at first
# I just turned up my nose
# She said, "What's wrong? This shirt cost $50"
# I said, "This shirt is whack and it's not worth this dollar!"
# The next half hour was the same old thing
# My mother buying me clothes from 1993
# And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
# I asked her for Asissant and she bought me Skips!
# I said, "Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep"
# She said, "You're only a kid, you don't have a rep yet"
# So to you all the kids all across the land
# There's no need to argue
# Parents just don't understand
# Nah, Nah
# They don't understand

# My mom's bounced out for a week's vacation and
# She left the keys to the 5 double-o
# Gee, mom
# Well, how's she gonna know
# I'll just take it for a little spin
# And see what it looks like with 20 inch rims
# Then I be the man in my neighborhood
# Well, maybe I shouldn't
# Yeah, of course I should
# Payin' attention, cuz the plot is hot
# Yo, I pulled the car up to the end of my block
# That's when I saw this 9 piece starin' at my grill
# My CDs blarin from the radio
# Then she tried to pretend like she ain't noticed Nick
# So I blow a kiss like I know this chic
# She said, "Was that for me?"
# I said, "Yeah, you know it hun.
# Come take a ride with the young Billy B. William."
# She said, "How do I know you're not sick?
# You could be some kind of lunatic"
# "Uh, c'mon sugar, it's Nick for Nick,
# besides would a lunatic push a whip like this?"
# [3lw & Nick Cannon:]
# I agree that we were on our way
# He was lookin real good so we brought a Mustang
# Who's car is this?
# I'm a little curious
# So I stepped on the gas
# Fast and furious
# Wasn't impressed with the way he burned rubber
# The car phone rang
# "Yo, who is it?"
# "Your mother"
# On the phone wielin', the way my mom sounded
# There was no way to avoid being grounded
# I can't believe it
# I just made a mistake
# Well, parents are the same no matter time or place
# So to all you kids
# Across the land
# Take it from me
# Parents just don't understand
# [Chorus (Repeat to Fade)]
> Lil Romeo
# [Lil' Romeo]
# Little Soldiers need love
# Little kisses and hugs
# Come get wit these thugs
# I'm tellin' you I'm livin' it up
# We can walk through the park, hold hands to it stop
# It's somethin' about you I don't know but it touches my heart
# In school you make me blush
# Yeah It's all about us
# Haters constantly hatin' always talkin' bout us
# Understand I'm your man, so why go talk to a friend
# Regardless of what they say, we gonna rap to the end
# My little mommy, I'm sayin' my little dime piece
# My baby, my boo, my future wifey
# I'm keepin' it real thats why you friends don't like me
# They jealous, they want a little soldier like me
# Chorus: Lil' Romeo (repeat 2x)
# Little soldiers need love
# Little soldiers need love
# Little soldiers need love
# Don't, Don't, Don't hurt me again
# [Lil' Romeo]
# Four months past
# We still pitchin' letters in class
# I'm bugs your babes bunny, you always makin' me laugh
# We ride bumper cars and rollarcoasters together
# Your my best friend, I'll remember you forever
# Like when the first time I saw you I just had ta speak
# Heard of love it first sight so it just had ta be
# I took your hand
# Your my girl I'm your man
# It's funny ain't it, yesterday we was just friends
# Everyday I think about you, some times I dream about you
# If I had to go on without you it wouldn't be fair
# I know so much about you, look ma there's somethin I need to tell you
# Chorus: Lil' Romeo (repeat 2x)
# [Lil' Romeo]
# I hear you movin'
# What about us? What are you doin'?
# Two years now, everything we hoped for is ruined
# How could you leave how could you do this to me
# I'm to young to be in love, how foolish of me
# Thinkin' sometimes love comes to an end
# I can't believe it I'm never gonna see you again
# How could you hurt me
# You said you would never desert me
# But these feelings that I have for you
# You was my first kiss, my first love
# 1,000 miles away, we can't even hug
# If we could do it all over I would keep it the same
# Romeo and Juliett, write your name in the sand
# Chorus: Lil' Romeo (repeat 2x)
> Lil Romeo
# [Lil Romeo talking]
# Yo, I know we too young to be feelin' like this
# We was ment for eachother

# Lil' Wyte's the name - their ain't a day pass
# That I ain't in trouble, this changes the game
# And turns a summer sault to a double
# They hatin' me now - I vapped out and they gon' feel my rumble
# But it is all gravy - I'm running and ain't 'bouta stumble
# Backoff a few years and you will find some crooked decisions
# I managed them clear and did not let them break down my vision
# That's all I don't need - somebody try'na stop what I'm givin'
# But there's just too many hoes out there to give one bi*** my pimpin'
# I'm bringin' ya Memphis - I just joined the white rapper convention
# Back in the day - I blazed my hay and dreamed about recognition
# But I done made it, they hate it
# I love it, becuz of DJ Paul and Juicy J - I got so far from above it
# Pushin' and shovin' they don't know of that I'm posted on a regular
# Good 'ole boy from around the way - might be small but don't test me brah
# Question brah, listen brah, yes thats what I'm stressin' brah
# Yes thats me in your hood, 2-doo' Cutlass - what I'm flexin' brah
# [Chorus: Lil' Wyte]
# Jus' the good 'ole boys - hangin' out geddin' high
# Jus' the good 'ole boys - watchin' cops ridin' by
# Jus' the good 'ole boys - sittin' round drinkin' beer
# Jus' the good 'ole boys - we was the clique the haters feared
# Jus' the good 'ole boys - never really wanted blow
# Jus' the good 'ole boys - was overloaded on that dro
# Jus' the good 'ole boys - 2 doo' Cutlass what we flexin'
# Jus' the good 'ole boys - if you in the road you better move we comin' yo direction
# [Lil' Wyte]
# Don't let yo window catch a cloud - I'm as high as you
# I know you wish this song would keep on bumpin' through a pound or .2
# But it's all good - it's gonna go off - like everything that goes up comes down
# I make sounds come out my mouf - then put now snawls to make 'em melt
# Watch me guarantee the game - nothing but some f***ing pain
# Put cyanide in cyringes and inject it in they veins
# Threw up on the league the hardest music Memphis seen in a while
# Hit me quick wit' Triple 6 and then let out +Mystic Style+
# I was hook and good 'ole boys like me was catching the vibe
# I survive - I strive now look at me - I'm all in the sky
# Keep in mind, I was the one overlooked alla the times
# Deep inside, I thought that I was the one never would rise
# Here I am, I'm spittin' it out and bringin' it too ya taday
# Ain't no gangsta, just a Bay, area represento wit' something to say
# So if you want me come get me - y'kno where I'm at
# I'm prolly there right now, but there's no way good 'ole boy
# Like me go out without my Crown now
# [Lil' Wyte]
# It's like this, good 'ole boys - I don't get what they can out this game
# Whether we are, down in our slums or we on top of this thang
# Cuz I've got, some real ones rollin' with me down for the cause
# Even if the, situation get sticky they ain't 'bouta pause
# So I must, watch over my fleet and lead em all inta victory
# Mystery how did I get here, all the rest is just history
# Liberty is what I'm seekin' to get away from misery
# Mess with me - you'll be f***ed up
# Cause I'll let out inner energy
# Never was a problem child - always kept up with the game
# The slang, and somehow everyone in the hood knew my name
# It ain't my fault it made me, too be something that you ain't
# It is my fault I'm doing, something that y'kno you cant
# Man I remember gettin' drunk, drinkin' my self unda the flo'
# Reminiscin' of throwing up - makin' love to the camode
# I did my dirt, didn't I get caught and still serf' birds in the end
# But that's all right cuz All I need's my little girl and my pen

# Start this night out right so i dont fall on my face
# I got some red necks wit me ready to get drunk and shot da gauge
# They got 6 shots of tequila and half a bottle of bacardi
# The bottle came from someones cooler when we left the bonfire party
# They constantly askin fo mo and tryin to pour me up a shot
# Incredible hulk mixed wit vodka and a skotch on the rocks
# Crown royal wit coke a bud light my eye balls afloat
# So much f***in liquid in me i got to hit da pi**er fo sho
# Keepin up wit hill billys actin silly drunker then sh**
# This might compare to my smokin song but pimpin this is not it
# This is my drinkin song so you know wut you got to do
# Drink twelve or twenty one or wut eva you do but dont stop at two
# [Chorus x2]
# This is my drinkin song
# And there aint no rules wut you waitin on
# Pop a bottle pour your self a shot or even brew your own
# If your goin to drink might as well drink until you hit the floor
# Afta you hit the floor get yo ass up and pour a couple mo
# Aight im alright listen to my words I have dranken up half the bar
# And still yet a swurl I heard
# I looked down at red neck he look like he was about to hurl
# Brother robby actin similiar but was spinnin like the world
# Now real rednecks can get drunk like some sh** ive neva seen
# Ten shots bud lights fo chasin and ready for round eleventeen
# Demolition derbys at the races rodeos and hill streets
# When ever legal liqour sold white folks will meet
# But we all want to get f***ed up and when i say we
# Im talkin about every nationality on this g.l.o.b.e
# And some do, some dont, some might like it, some wont,
# I'll tell you wut i love this so much im f***ed up right now

# We jump in slappa's car dont worry this fool wasnt driven
# The outcome would of been ridiculous and we wouldnt of survived
# Believe it or not i was the most sober of the five of us
# Liquor in me got to pi** again i feel like im bout to bust
# Good thing we got out the exit fo me to handle my buisness
# I jumped out to drain my lizard and god as my witness
# I see a truck load of moonshine hideing behind some trees
# Wit the keys in it and nobody around
# No one but me this mean we can get drunker and crunker
# And make us some cheese from mariana arkansas
# Through the woods back to tennessee
# This event start anotha good ol'boy fraiser drinkin day
# In the back of a chevelle pick up shootin of this daze

# [Chorus: repeat 4X]
# Drop it off drop it off
# bi*** I got a sawed off
# Put that money in the bag
# Hoe I'll blow yo ass off
# [Verse One]
# It all started out cool and calm, we had it under control
# We had blueprints to the bank from roof to floor
# My nigga Paul had them yawks and bullet-proof vests
# Juicy dropped off the 600 the get away the best
# We had an in-sider that was working for Union Planners
# She told us everyday at 6 o clock they turn off the cameras
# At 6 o five the guards go on break for milk and banannas
# Six thirty guards come back from break and back on with the cameras
# So that gives us twenty five minutes to get in and out
# We gotta do this sh** so quick and slick without a doubt
# I got some folks that be down to ride all it takes a shout
# And if its business they comin quicker thats what they bout
# God as my witness we gonna get this one some way some how
# With thirty million dollars in diamonds we cant miss out
# The plans in action tomorrow we gon case it out
# Give me twenty four more hours and we gon clean it out
# [Verse Two]
# It's going down five o'clock and we loadin the trucks up
# Get the 40's get the vests get the masks get the pump
# Dont forget the smoke bombs to cloud them out when we get done
# Man this sh**s about to get so hecked up under the sun
# Six o clock pullin up and we know surveillance off
# Six o five guards are breaking and were waiting on the cough
# Thats the sign to come in and lay everyone on the ground
# Units in faces of customers so they dont make a sound
# Keep your guns up and your masks on till the cash gone
# Now lets get this thirty million in diamonds and mash on
# 8 minutes left on the clock before the cameras click
# Back into rotation on the bank and they scope out the sh**
# Got the jewerly got the loot, situations looking cool
# All of a sudden a cop comes outta no where and he start to shoot
# So many rounds is wizzin by me I dont see how I aint dead
# Smooth? stepped in the way with a AK and shot the cop in his head
# [Verse Three]
# We got the diamonds in the stash spot, and 10 in he tank
# But the police on our tail an officer down in the bank
# So we hit the gas threw the masks, lost the vests and ditched the gats
# Made a corner, hit it fast, man these folks all on our ass
# Push the 600 to the limit, we doin a dance
# Fraiser hit the brakes goin 150 tryin to make em crash
# Trippin in the back seat cause im high up off that mary jane
# Talkin crazy, its over this time and it aint funny man
# Ballin down Lamar dodgin cars and we aint tryin to stop
# My Rolley onion came off of a side street and smacked a cop
# But they still comin, its seven of em, and they catchin quick
# After Sunroof I through a smoke bomb and they got lost in it
# Make a left a right a quick left, pullin to this driveway
# Turn your tail lights off and just park and dont go no where just stay
# Pokey off our trail hot as hell but we still gotta shoot
# Back to headquarters to come forward seperatin the loot

# Run the bizzo fo' shizzo roll up another blunt my nizzo
# I got to maintain, I got to get changed
# I got to rip this mic, from California to Maine
# And take it over to Spain, send it to the Dominicans
# Tell 'em to examine it and start jammin' all of my sinitist
# Make sure that they remember this, like if it was some religious shit
# The white, gold, ghetto, platinum, rap hoggin', i'm rippin it
# And take it to the bank, get to deposit it, take a slip and fill it out

# [Verse Two - Lil' Wyte]
# Check it out i'm new on the scene, Lil' Wyte lighted with gasoline
# Fire breathin' gettin' closer to the grass that isn't green
# Which means your team is piled over in the back
# Sixteen bars on the side and knowledge on every track
# Holdin' it down, never happenin', gettin' my crown, keep on rappin'
# And even at 75 i'ma still be able to work my magic
# Beater, i'm pacin in front of the next new generation
# Rising legacy shinin' the cross of soberbination
# Need a passport and luggage and a new wardrobe
# Fifty billion but I will settle for 2.4
# Check the scans i'm the man in this independent land
# No video or no single countin' g's like I be damned
# This white cat can rap and put on a good show
# It's funny how this music can put me down to the flo'
# I got to give it raw I got to give it dirty
# What ever city you reppin' beat 'em down if you heard me

# [Verse Three - Lil' Wyte]
# See I done seen the brighter days with plenty hating rays
# My album hit a hundred thousand now shit been going my way
# I give my props to my pops give my props to my mouth
# Give my props to the camp give my props to the south
# Now i'm drunk and i'm high but I bet you already knew it
# You buck as me you buck as us and we twice as buck as u
# Security started movin' to the middle of the crowd
# Only if he got a gun I agree to shut it down
# I ain't trying to get shot by no motherfucking punk
# I know by days this shit too many drinkin' and all of a sudden crunk
# Pick me up let me out blow me up and bump me loud
# Too many styles be coming up out of me that when I break I hit the crowd
# I have a high page game face eye balls poppin' out
# With this shit tryin' to stay awake what you think?
# Only cracker good enough to be down with the six
# Clearly understood that this is some original gangsta shit
# [Chorus - Lil' Wyte]
# Will you beat 'em to the flo' in the club?! (I sho will!)
# Will you jack 'em even if they ain't dub?! (I sho will!)
# If he actin' like a bitch!, we gon' treat 'em like a bitch!

# Man, I'm messed up  the hell  what kind of pill was that
# GOD  man it sound like I hear someone screaming
# what the fuck  man I'm sooo fucked up, God I promise let me live
# tonite  man I will never get high again
# [Lil Wyte]
# I'm slummed out right now, that ain't no suprize
# Dilated pupils seein doubles out of both my eyes
# I hit up a little spark, got 'em for no charge, and fuck with his boy
# Zanex bars call 'em totem poles or even tonka toys
# I popped half and then popped the other half and hit the crown
# Then put my shot glass down and poured another round
# I'm starting to fill everything I just put into my body
# Liquor and the bars got me right though I might look retarded
# Get up out my way little quicka with the K
# Even though I'm fucked up I'ma still maintain
# Got sumthin in my brain like do damn thang
# Like tell the same mayne's ass soft insane
# I'ma monsta when I'm high specially on some bars
# Don't need to cop lyrically can catch a charge
# Runnin down the street yellin fuck the police
# With Reeboxs on my feet high on 4 more bars
# I'ma hold my crown and I'ma rep my Memphis pop my pills, smoke all my deeros
# Be fucked up fall out in public fallin out on crackers and negros
# Ho you think you know Lil Wyte I'm telling you rightcha now
# You hold out I'ma find out better pull 'em out and pass them sticks around
# Totem poles, Candy bars, even Yellow ladders
# Tonka toys, White sticks it don't really matter
# If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you
# If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you
# Totem poles, Candy bars, even Yellow ladders
# Tonka toys, White sticks it don't really matter
# If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you
# If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you

# One little pill you can break down into fo's
# Guaranteed when mixed with liquor it gone have on the flo'
# Take advantage of the power the sticks put off every hour
# Try to over do it you gone find yourself off in the shower
# This is not some powder the effects are completely differant
# You are not a coward if you pop one and get scared of the shit
# You might forget what you did the night before if you want 'em
# Better get somebody to be witcha only if they ass is sober
# Gotta keep my fuckin brain on chicken lane change only if the beat bang
# I'll be able to do my thang no what I got to do know why I gotta rock
# Fucked up or not I'ma take this shit to the top
# If you see me in the streets betta believe me this cracker is off the hezzy
# Memphis, Tennessee is my stopping ground and zanex bars just went down in me
# This weed in me and Henessey all over my academics T
# Was fucked up and doubled in for shit but fallin up out the S-U-V
# They serious don't play with 'em if you can't handle 'em come my way
# We'll rock 'em to the BAY and we'll deal 'em up on the slang
# When I bump my female in an all night bang with a BIOTCH!

# I run the set, man, causing chaos everywhere
# Wanna make a bet, man
# I'll have you pulling out your hair
# This is a have-to-do job
# But on a need-to-know basis
# Don't keep your eyeballs on the prize
# Don't keep up with the faces
# I roll with murderers, robbers
# Drug dealers, killers, and rapists
# Also an army on the porch
# With plenty rockets a'waitin
# Come test my patience, fool
# And find out how Lil Wyte will react
# I'll have these haters, fool
# Flopping like some fish on their back
# They got me f***ed up
# I'm about to load them trucks up
# When I get crazy then you
# Just might feel some hot stuff
# This was not on my agenda
# I was just only playing
# But since you're testing my gangsta
# It's too damn late for praying
# [Chorus - 2x]
# Automatic gun fire busting at you hoes
# To get my point across
# You got raw bullet to your dome
# Is what I'm about to toss
# Sold me a short sack
# Now you about to feel the trauma
# Sulfuric acid, so clogged
# In a pine box for your momma
# What am I about to do
# Some says you already know
# Bring your family in this? No!
# I ain't as cool as you folks
# This sh**s between me and you
# But between you and me
# I got a feeling it might be all up to G-O-D
# And you can talk all of the trash
# You want it don't even matter
# As long as my album keep selling
# My pockets gonna get fatter
# I guess the static is because
# I am the chosen one
# Deadly circumstances come with job
# Better have your gun
# You might be found bleeding
# Seeking for the perpetrator
# Something tells me he real far
# And you won't find him, player
# Quit your crying, bi***ing
# And your whining, hating
# Faking, fronting
# I'll run your ass up up off the block
# 'Cause I'm a motherf***ing
# Static addict, static addict, loco with that automatic
# Static addict, static addict, crazy with the gun

# Can come and scoop me after school
# Like I'm supposed to be on it
# Naw ain't no sippin' over here
# It's Big Pimpin' over here
# And I hope that I make myself clear
# That when it comes to honeys yo I got some minutes
# And I ain't tryna get serious till I'm up in my twenties
# It's just the paper that I'm after
# The drop with the top I'mma cop when I'm able
# And that's all that matters
# So if I told you something shorty
# I'm taking that back
# Cause I'm just too young to get down like that

# A young entrepenuer wit amazin' talent
# In order to be the best you must take the challenge
# I'm tryin' a be number one cause number two don't matter
# People try to pull you down when you climb the ladder
# Niggaz hate to see you up but they love it when you down
# That's why I'm always quiet when I come around
# Cause - talk is cheap, that's why I rap
# I'm gettin' NBA money wit no salary cap
# Momma, it feel good puttin' money in ya mailbox
# This for my niggaz locked up in the cell blocks
# [Chorus: Lil' Flip, Heather Markey] - (Repeat 2X)
# Sun don't shine, that's why I spit these rhymes
# To ease my mnd

# [Verse 2: Lil' Flip]
# In life (in life), you go through joy and pain
# And when somebody close die, it give you a migraine
# And a whole lot a stress, a whole lot a tears
# Days turn into nights, nights turn into years
# I'm not happy here, I want another atmosphere
# I gotta get away, just to get my mind clear
# That's why I smoke so much, cause it relieve my stress
# Just imagine - everyday I gotta wear my vest
# I gotta watch my back cause niggaz plottin' a jack
# When you see these movin' like crack, you feel that?
# And to my niggaz in jail, you better keep ya head up (keep ya head up)
# To my niggaz in the hood, keep ya bread up
# [Chorus: Lil' Flip, Heather Markey] - (Repeat 2X)
# [Verse 3: Lil' Flip]
# If I died today, shit, I lived my life
# And if I could do it again, I'd do it twice
# No mo' movin' white or shootin' dice
# Or creepin' late night tryin' a screw ya wife (ha ha ha!)
# Cause I'm a changed man, wit the heart of a lion
# Even if I was a midget, I'd fight a giant
# I never give up (I never give up), I'm from the home of the brave (home of

# We don't have to be in love (love)
# We can just be friends!
# I will be right there, beginning to the end!
# I can bring my girls (girls), you can bring your friends (friends)
# We can both have fun, don't want this stuff to end!

# I take private jets to Vagas, man
# It's twenty bread each pick cause I'm major man
# We can cruise the world in a Bently Azure

# You couldn't ask for more cause we got it all (we got it all)
# Cause you my baby girl right?, right?

# So how you love that, or do you really hate it
# Or do you love the rims on my drop top Mercedes
# I pack a 3-80, cause I got to watch my back

# They keep learning over and over, the same lessons
# Boys be hanging out on the block, hitting licks
# Then go waste all they money, on a new pair of kicks
# All they profits is spent, on some food and new clothes
# So they taking prison chances, for a new wardrobe
# It don't make sense, and it sho don't make dollas

# I got the mask, I got the strap, soon as I find the gloves
# We gonna start exposin' off like Farhrenheit 9/11
# [Verse 2: Jadakiss]
# I'ma speak clearly 'cause I don't think they hearin' me

# I'ca get it right to ya, sticky green white to ya
# Wear whatever you want, bullets goin' right through ya

# sh**, that's a license to kill niggaz
# [Verse 3: T.I.]
# I refuse to lose, I rather give these weak dudes the blues
# And separate them from they jewels, teach 'em don'ts and do's
# I raise tools, make crews make decisions confused
# All spectators can say is, 'This lil' nigga's a fool'
# A short fuse with some loose screws, some unscrewed
# Better prove, you niggaz p**** as the Moulan Rouge
# So who guardin' who, you know who to you know what
# To you know where, goin' 'gainst 'em's too unfair

# Bolinsiaga, flimsy condo with bimbos in south of Kalan Gro in pimp mode
# The inf' glow on his clothes and you know it's over

# Was a young black man, now I'm trying to raise one
# The good die fast, the devil he work slow
# How you gon hate a man, that you barely even know
# I look the other way, turn my head
# Instead, they'd rather see me broke or even dead

# For the spectators, it was sooner or later
# Skater, don't cost you nothing to be a hater

# At times, I don't know what to say
# And all I do is pray, day to day
# But still, I feel my strength might die
# Like right now, I'm tryin' hard not to cry
# Even when I close my eyes, I still see it
# Damn, I just don't believe it
# The bad times I buried, like the cemetery
# Unworthy people playin' beneficiaries
# A lotta people eatin' off of one man's death
# Don't you worry B.I., I'mma ride to my last breath
# You killas, caused a lotta devastation
# You have no idea what you did to this nation
# I fuckin' hate you, excuse my frustration
# But just when I'm about to quit, God tells me to just

# Frank White, the man with the money and the fame
# Passed away, now bitches wanna claim his name
# I been with my nigga before he came in the game
# No one's, no V's, we used to take the train
# Just us and the Mafia goin' out to parties
# I guess back then we was real nobodies
# But he was my nigga, and I was his bitch
# I rolled hard with him, how could I forget him
# Had beef with yo wife that ain't patched up
# But still got love for your kids
# Even wrote 'em in my will
# And I'mma make sure the fam keep a decent meal
# No matter what I got to do, or who I got to kill
# Shit is real, baby, there ain't no appeal
# If I'm fucked up, imagine how Mrs. Wallace feels
# Sometimes I sit and think how it would be if we was married
# Of if I woulda kept the child that I carried
# So to my ladies, don't think I haven't walked in yo shoes
# Or thought this was only happenin' to you, righ'
# Here's my shoulder, you can lean on this boo
# Cuz trust me, I know it's sad but you got to...
# [Repeat Chorus]
# [Kim - Verse Three]
# So I guess you know the story of how it all ends
# Depressed, stressed, don't know who's my real friends
# One thing's for sure, I can count on my mens
# D-Roc, Money, L, Lil' Cease, and PD
# My whole B.I. family, remind me of you
# We miss you so much, I love you so much
# Never thought life without you would be so rough
# But I know we gon make it
# We ain't happy, but we fakin'
# And to New York, thanks for the support
# And all our real fans, I'm shoutin' out the whole land
# This is somethin' young kids just won't understand
# How they took away this beautiful man
# Who shared so many memories
# I could go on and on, but a song can only be so long
# It's been hard, but I told God that I put up a fight
# So here's a Long Kiss Goodnight, Frank White

# My Aunt Dot left a glot, there's some blood on the sheets
# Told me to clean the shit up, then she hit the streets
# Even though I'm her neice, she copped me a piece
# Wack-ass caliber, nickel-plated with the Salender, what?
# She don't know I like my guns pretty
# Like my boy Pastor Troy with the twin Glizzy's
# I haerd a knock at the door
# To my surprise, I saw these two familiar eyes
# Who are you? (What up, I'm Shaince, don't remember me?)
# She called me by my government name Kimberly
# Who sent you?
# [Lil' Shanice]
# My mom sent me
# Her name is Dotty
# She packed a note in my knapsack, along with a shotty
# [Lil' Kim] (Lil' Shanice)
# Heh, she was cute and mad fly
# She had the Prada knapsack, with the hat to match
# Bararri hiking boots with the mink Bubble Goose
# And I could see she was admiring my mink ski-suit
# Then she handed me the note (Here, read this)
# I just stared her up and down cause I couldn't believe it
# Then I opened it
# It said bitches is out to get you
# Your so-called friends put a bomb in ya Benz
# I'm on a mission now to do some harm to your friends
# They know where you live, so evacuate the crib
# And oh, the little girl, that's ya cousin Shanice
# Since I can't be with her, I need you to babysit her
# Besides, she looks up to you
# You're her idol, and tomorrow is her first violin recital
# And she would be more than happy if you could take her
# Peace, my number is on back of the paper, hit me later
# Damn, what went wrong?
# Can't we all just get along? And make hit songs
# Bitches all up in my ass like a thong
# If this was a show, ya'll hoes would get gone
# Cause if it's on, then it's on, bring it on
# What the fuck you waitin' for? Come on, let's get it on
# What? What's takin' you so long
# I've got plans for future to bring back ya head like Medusa
# Chorus
# Girls be actin' stink and mad funny
# Ya'll bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
# Can't stand the pain, then pop a Humphry
# I know it hurts
# (I'm feelin' ya'll)
# Girls be actin' stink and mad funny
# Ya'll bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
# Can't stand the pain, then pop a Humphry
# I know it hurts
# (I'm feelin' ya'll)
# (Lil' Shanice)
# Uh, we in the Range and it's fucked up weather
# It's snowin' and I'm tryin' to put the whole shit together
# How Laverne, she always wanted to be like me
# Dress like me, and look like me
# And Nicole, it's like she lived in my house
# Askin' me for money, day in and day out
# And last but not least, the grimmiest one Tiesha
# She planned it all, come to find out her name is Keisha
# Come on Shanice, I'm takin' you to my house in Alpine
# (I wanna go with you)
# Uh, be quiet and we'll get along fine
# [Lil' Shanice]
# Come on please, I wanna be just like you
# 600 Mercedes and 380's in my doll babies
# Crazy brogette's in my barrets
# And H-class rocks inside my baby G-shots
# Fuck Bonnie and Lancock, I don't love them hoes
# But anything goes when it comes to bank rolls
# Diamonds on my toes, X and O's
# Versace hottie in designer clothes
# Stick little Lincoln and Dutch, them take 'em to Toys 'R Us
# Make them spend they G's, then kick 'em out, make 'em catch the bus
# The S, the H, the A, the N, the I, the C, the E
# But all my friends call me Miss Little Queen Bee
# What what, I like the gleam
# Know what I mean?
# Ever see the Professional? Well I can clean
# [Lil' Kim] (Aunt Dot)
# You know what? I like you, little big person
# Rule number one, no cursin', but anyway
# What you know about that? You too young for that
# When I was your age, I would've got hung for that
# Then I picked up the phone, to call my Aunt Dot
# So she can fill me in a little more about the plot
# Hold on, 9-1-7 5-3-8-2-1-2-2
# (Hello?) Yo, what's the deal?
# Body's gettin' spunnin' out, I mean whats this all about?
# [Aunt Dot]
# See it's sorta like what Tonya Harding did to Nancy
# They don't want you to win no more
# But probably don't want you to attend no more
# And I guess that's why they ain't your friends no more
# The other day when I was comin' out the grocery store
# I saw the bitch Nicole in front of the salon next door (For real?)
# Yep, and I choked the bitch out
# Placed one to the heart
# Tied up her hands and feet, threw into my back seat
# Then I dumped her on a dead end street
# The other two, yeah, they still linger
# But don't lift a finger, I'ma get 'em
# So just play and come home
# When we hang up, get rid of your phone
# [Lil' Kim]
# Woo, when Aunt Dot comes, oh brother
# It's like five Bloody Mary's, one after another
# Hmmph, she have you stressed
# No wearin' white, no sex
# And when she get vexed, guess what happen next?
# Cause them other two girls that's still on the menu
# Is the reason why the story is to be continued...
# Chorus
# Girls be actin' stink and mad funny

# That's how we do it, you chicks is no thrill
# Doin' it Flinstones style, car with no wheels
# Still on tricycles, riding bicycles
# Our diamonds be so white they look like icicles
# I'm getting sick and tired of hearing all these rough drafts
# On the countdown, don't make me laugh
# Got my own company, I'm chief of the staff
# They say we twins then I'm the better half

# [Lil' Mo]
# Got a strange call from a girl
# In the midst of the night, uh huh
# She said you better call your man
# Cause he sleepin' right here tonight
# So I put on my coat
# And my hat and then put on my shoes, yeah yeah
# I said bitch don't you move
# Cause I'll be seeing you soon
# It only took me
# Chorus
# In five minutes, I was knockin' at the door
# In two minutes, I had her on the floor
# In one minute, I was fightin' wit' my man
# Yes I did it, and I told his tail to scram
# In five minutes, I was knockin' at the door
# In two minutes, I had her on the floor
# In one minute, I was fightin' wit' my man
# Yes I did it, and I told his tail to scram
# [Lil' Mo]
# Saw a few scratches on my car
# Just the other day, yeah yeah yeah
# Neighbor around my way
# Said she saw you drivin' away
# So I put two together
# And I found myself ready to go, whoa whoa
# Before she even knew it
# I was comin' down the road
# It only took me
# Chorus
# In five minutes, I was knockin' at the door
# In two minutes, I had her on the floor
# In one minute, I was fightin' wit' my man
# Yes I did it, and I told his tail to scram
# In five minutes, I was knockin' at the door
# In two minutes, I had her on the floor
# In one minute, I was fightin' wit' my man
# Yes I did it, and I told his tail to scram
# Bridge
# Be a hoe
# I'm kickin' you up out the door
# I hope you know
# Like Coolio, you gotta go
# Don't even think
# I'm gonna let you hang around
# Got your drawz down
# Lookin' stupid like a clown
# Be a hoe

# Cause you know these jackers trip, when you ride on swangs
# And when the light hit ya ice, man ya ice go bling
# But if you run up on this harder gun, it might go bang
# In fact don't even doubt it, boy your life gon end
# Hit the valet, hopped out dressed to kill
# And I don't ever wait in line, I know Ed and Dell
# Went straight to the bar, like what's the deal
# And they already know, put my Cris' in a pail
# Got my Cristal, fired up a do-do square
# Nigga let's ball, Fat Rat's in this bitch West-West y'all
# You niggaz know, how I do it
# I'm looking for a bad bitch, so she can swallow my fluid
# [Hook - 2x]
# I'm in the club, getting high with all of my thugs
# Drinking Cris', niggaz showing me love what
# I'm in the club, getting high with all of my thugs
# Drinking Cris', bitches showing me love what
# [Lil' O]
# I gave dap to real playas, from the South to the North
# Then ran up on a bitch, with a back like a horse
# She said ain't you Fat Rat, with the Lac and the Porsche
# She was all on my sack, I could tell by her voice
# I told her look here baby, I got all kinds of toys
# But fuck that, are we cutting like Pastor Troy
# Cause them tits, bout the size of some asteroids
# And I love nuttin' on breasts, ask them boys
# Then the DJ seen my face, and started playing my song
# And the crowd went crazy, when "Back, Back" came on
# Then he backed on to, "We Ain't Broke No Mo"
# We all started throwing up broke, cause we ain't broke no mo'
# Big balling, we don't roach no mo'
# Giving thanks to the father, we ain't gotta slang coke no mo'
# But we always celebrate, for our niggaz on lock
# That's why we fire up the dro, and make the Cris' go pop
# [Hook - 2x]
# [Lil' O]
# Now it's 3 in the morning, and a nigga's lit
# I'm drunker than a motherfucker, man I'm out this bitch
# Told the valet, to bring me my drop
# I seen boo from earlier, I told her what's up you gon give me some cot
# She said cool Lil' O, it's however you want it
# You just gotta be the G, you wan' hop up on it
# I said bitch say no mo', don't spoil the moment
# Cause I'ma beat the pussy up, like it's my opponent
# Now she hopped in the drop, we went straight to the room
# And she's trying to be the bride, well I ain't the groom
# Bent her ass right over, jumped dead in her womb
# Bust a nut told her bitch, check out time's at noon

# I got a AK-47, with bullets like cone heads
# And when I let it loose, it eat niggaz like corn bread
# You niggaz wanna fuck with me, well gon head

# I'm Mr. AK, Mr. Aim-Cock-And-Shoot
# I'm Mr. Come-Through-In-A-Lexus, and pop the roof
# On all you hating ass niggaz, that's off of Screw

# ha-ha, money's good, ha-ha
# Bitches is crazy, but you know what
# Ain't nothing sweeter than revenge
# Feel me (feel me)
# I've been waiting for the day, I can get my revenge
# Now my money right, nigga I'm a made man
# To let shit ride, wasn't never in the plan
# Whoever did me wrong, I'll pay em back times ten
# I was treated like rubbers, I was used and threw away
# It's hard knowing my dogs, wanna do me away
# See we was close, and man that's what really hurts the most
# See I was short of roast, if I wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost
# See we was kin folk, now what was between us is jeopardized
# You crossed Poppy, now I'm peeping your weakness like leopard eye
# Should I let him slide, forgive him let God step inside
# But we better collide, severe our ties and let him fry
# And show him it's real, we heathen up a slow in his grill
# Or let him make it, even though I know I owe him the steel
# The Devil's tempting me, to let these niggaz know how I feel
# But I won't never have peace, within my soul if I kill
# You know the deal, my mind keeps painting dramatic scenes
# Cause my friends basically did me, with no Vaseline
# But I'm the raw cat, niggaz who want static bewteen
# Cause testing me, is like smoking while bathing in gasoline
# It wasn't really nice, I got a car on my motor
# My nigga screaming through the phone, said he sold a soda
# Said the product wouldn't sell, like there's no promoters
# Every graham straight vanished, like hocus pocus
# These are dope back, besides Hector know that
# Bout my money, have his family kissing Kodak's
# With ten bricks in the Benz 6, I'm well connected
# Motorized stash spot, no smell detected
# It's getting hectic, I got the power like snap
# I was a ghetto chemist, who turned powder to crack
# I need revenge, cause this was passed over due
# Revenge, if it's the last thing I do
# Revenge, silencers no sound
# Revenge, what goes around comes around
# Revenge is sweet, revenge is just a part of the streets
# He made it harder, for my daughter to eat
# [Hook - 2x]
# [Lil' O]
# When they said you was a snitch, I should of cracked your jaw
# Put a bat to your cranium, and cracked your skull
# But I trusted you, I was like that's my brah
# We grew up together, he would never rat to laws
# You called and asked for raw, said you need it non-soft
# I dropped it off and left, but before I got far
# Laws hopped out, yelling stop the car
# And if you try something fly, we gon stop your heart
# You set the trap, nigga I'ma get you back
# You like a soldier with no gun, you need protection black
# Right when you think it's all good, and ain't expecting that
# I'ma pop up in your rear, and go and split your hat
# Mafia style, kill you in front your wife and your child
# Ask em how they want you done, cooked spicy or mild
# Laugh loud while I watch the slugs, slicing you down
# And I'ma celebrate go wild, and have a night on the town bitch

# Verse I
# I just kicked it at home, I polished up the chrome
# Call the ruca on the phone, let her know Im home alone, Its
# Seven thirty and the sun is going down, Its a
# Summer night and the fun is going down
# I picked her up and she looks all dolled up (She looks good)
# Sitting passenger in my rag impala (yeah)
# I let her know she looks beautiful to me
# The world is an ugly place but shes such a site to see
# The kind of woman that would put up a fight for me
# The kind that wants to spend summer nights with me
# The temp was eighty and Im cruising with my lady
# Playing some Ralphie Pagan, Ohh Baby Baby
# I see my home boys and theyÃƒÂ¢re crusing in their rides (Hey was up homes)
# With their ladies sitting by their side
# People think we look crazy, but I think we look classy
# But then again thats only if you ask me
# Chorus:
# Summer days just sitting around but when the sun goes down Ill be ready to party

# Verse II
# My home boys throwing a back yard boogie,
# So every body gets together to unwind, relax and have a fun time
# The dj is spinning so I grab the mic and be like
# Aint nothing like them summer nights
# The party is packed with beautiful woman and
# A gang of the homies that want to get with them
# And theyll say anything just to hit em
# And its usually a nice summer night when they did em
# I dont know, it must be something in the air
# Cant help but have a good time, because the feeling is there
# To some people the feeling is rare
# They're at the pad saying God dam I wish I was there
# To have a drink, have a tok and hook up
# With some one fine but the kind that looks up
# Got to keep some pisto in the cup
# Party until the sun comes up or we give up
# Chorus:
# Summer days just sitting around but when the sun goes down Ill be ready to party

# Aint nothing like them summer nights
# Verse III
# Them summer nights can keep a smile on your face
# Gotta try to have a good time with your life otherwise it's just a waste
# Either way Im gonna party just in case
# Like prince partied like it was 99, in 87, 88
# I couldnt ask for no better weather, Im right next to the Pacific to be specific
# The candy paint job glows under the moon light
# As I close out my summer night and say good night
# Its time to put the top up and park it, drop it
# Unplug the ground, roll up the windows and lock it
# Walk into the pad and fall into bed
# As she lays on my chest to rest her sleepy head
# And we do this all night long
# From dust till dawn
# But its not the quite the same when summer nights are gone
# But even when theyre gone, it wont be long
# Eight more months and once again its on
# Chorus:
# Summer days just sitting around but when the sun goes down Ill be ready to party
# (Par-ty)
# Aint nothing like them summer nights
# Keep the top on drop while the girls looking hot, hit the volo and we just dont stop

# Bubble gum, balled up all the hustlers
# Y'all know how to work it when it's time to compete
# On the field, on the court, over any high steep
# And break, and you know it when you see your clone
# And right now that's all I see goin on, holla at me
# Game time, all I think about is bringing home the trophy
# If your team is better mine, you really gotta show me
# Really gotta beat me, really gotta trash talk
# Mistreat me, and send my squad back home
# Cuz I don't know loose to much
# Matter fact, I ain't never lost at all
# When I'm playin Hardball (that's right)
# So, if you on the mound about to pitch to me

# What? What?
# Money stretch
# Lil' Zane, what'cha saying?
# ATL's finest, what? What?
# Man you can check my lifestyle
# And see that I'm quite wild
# Seven twenty-eight night child
# Universal and versatile
# You study my style
# Trying to live spiritual
# And y'all looking now
# I can see right now
# Y'all will never understand me
# I call my best friend my family until they cross me
# Alcohol and weed cost me
# So I limit it
# Running niggas over like Emmitt did without a squad
# Drag you about a hundred yards
# Many bumps and scars
# Pull out in the hottest cars with my entourage
# Smoke more L's than Debarge
# With connects worldwide like Macintosh
# I practice living large
# Niggas out of town don't understand these kids (say what?)
# Niggas comin' to get me can't find where I live
# I got two or three cribs stack the mill in the mill
# Y'all get none of this dough shit y'all fiends stay ill
# Money stretch like a rubber band
# So wrap the grands up
# Catz got beef with me
# Go call your menz up
# Coming up unexpected
# Fucking your plans up
# Bustin' rounds lay it down
# It's not a game
# Money stretch like a rubber band
# So wrap the grands up
# Catz got beef with me
# Go call your menz up
# Coming up unexpected
# Fucking your plans up
# Bustin' rounds lay it down
# Now throw your hands up
# Name rings up in Hollywood
# But I'mma true nigga, I'mma stay Hollyhood
# I never change, might be a little busy though
# A little nigga from a big ass city yo
# I love the dough
# Give me hits, give me more chips
# I stay legit so the feds can't tell me shit
# I came in with nothing to lose
# Now I put my heart into making you move
# I'm far flung
# And the charts say I'm number one
# You number two nigga
# Check on the Billboard
# Who under who nigga?
# Far from an amateur, a money maker
# Leave your chick alone with me
# I bet I'll take her
# The game's taught me one thing
# Don't let her break you
# Money make the world go ‘round
# And the girls go down
# And even paralyzed niggas gonna feel me now
# For you nerds that study my words, ya heard
# Money stretch like a rubber band
# So wrap the grands up
# Catz got beef with me
# Go call your menz up
# Coming up unexpected
# Fucking your plans up
# Bustin' rounds lay it down
# (None of us fuck around)
# Money stretch like a rubber band
# So wrap the grands up
# Catz got beef with me
# Go call your menz up
# Coming up unexpected
# Fucking your plans up
# Bustin' rounds lay it down
# Now throw your hands up
# You steady being on the corner right
# Niggas ain't seen me in a while
# You probably thought I died
# You devils love to see a nigga down and teary eyed
# I call you idiot cause you don't know me really yet
# I'm from the ghetto and getting dough is all I know
# I'm on the low
# I'm a mystery to 5-0
# Cause they don't know
# Damn my check is caught in studio
# Business is lovely, see me in the videos
# Bitches wanna fuck me
# Worldwide nigga ride
# I'mma about to go to where some people call the other side
# And live my life in paradise, keep my family tight
# But I can't keep the way I'm going
# If the dough ain't right
# My last days I can't live my life inside a cage
# I'm getting money and you hataz don't do nothing for me
# Either you with me or against me
# Nigga let it show
# I get the dough non-stop when the track's hot
# And you know
# What? Now what?
# I ain't even gonna rhyme no more
# Y'all get the picture
# Money stretch like a rubber band
# So wrap the grands up
# Catz got beef with me
# Go call your menz up
# Coming up unexpected
# Fucking your plans up
# Bustin' rounds lay it down
# Money stretch like a rubber band
# So wrap the grands up
# Catz got beef with me
# Go call your menz up
# Coming up unexpected
# Fucking your plans up
# Bustin' rounds lay it down
# Money stretch like a rubber band
# So wrap the grands up
# Catz got beef with me
# Go call your menz up
# Coming up unexpected
# Fucking your plans up
# Bustin' rounds lay it down
# Money stretch like a rubber band
# So wrap the grands up
# Catz got beef with me
# Go call your menz up
# Coming up unexpected
# Fucking your plans up
# Bustin' rounds lay it down

# [Lil' Zane]
# Money is mandatory, my game is self explanitory
# I hit the blunt as I proceed to tell my ghetto stories
# I'm into deep,all my peeps, bring them shovel stories
# Some niggaz strapped with thier gats, tryin to kill your homez
# Didn't know me, but met the heat when they ran up on me
# Left his wife and 2 kids at the crib lonely
# Got in the way of a stray bullet when I pass
# Tryin to retaliate but keep that happin in the past
# Ways of the world, how will I last when the economy crash
# I'm goin all out gettin my cash
# While spend mine open, wit my eyes on the world
# Ghettos and jail cells gave me stories to tell
# Body swells from the evil smells that I inhale
# Evil set me up to fail make my life so real
# People tape will caution times being lost my soul series to scar
# I'm fighting off demons, it's the ways of the world
# [chorus: 2x]
# Even though it hurts chest
# I'm gonna stroke till I lose my breath
# lookin to sin since life began
# Coming all the way out the water to get oxygen
# Please father help me breathe again, at ease again
# [Lil' Zane]
# Looking at my self in the mirror, I took a second to think
# Memories of bein babies, given milk to drink
# Without a worry at mind, we would play all the time
# They ain't callin it but b-ball took up most of my time
# We were hard headed they all said it
# From my parents to our teachers and even my preacher,
# I say my prayers, I gave my momma grey hairs
# She lives in fear
# The thought of me not being there got her worried scared
# They say I look just like my father, without the beard
# they should have named that nigga magic and dissapear
# A couple months out of the year, he reappears
# its all the same, ain't nuttin changed, you still my nigga
# Don't hold a grudge, just give me love, I'm on my own
# I'm kinda sober from a broken home
# Wondering what's goin on, did I deserve this
# Living in Atlanta got this little nigga nervous
# Mama tried to feed us all, until she got laid off
# Had the rats paid off, now we all laid off
# chorus 2x
# [Lil' Zane]
# Duckin the gun shots,at the age of 13
# There was a war zone, so you choose your team
# When the war strikes you better have a heart to fight
# or get lost in the world when you loose your life
# I would like to get blown, so I read and pray
# Surviving day to day, running the streets of stray
# Living all my self no company
# You better meet the heat when you come for me
# And when I die, burn alive, that's a wish of mine
# I know that heaving in the zone ain't that hard to find
# and when you make it they gone take it, that's a must you know
# Don't think of gettin to the top without a problem or so
# I take for caution as for evil gotta hit on me
# I've been a bad boy for momma,dont you quit on me
# They built a jail so when we rise they can crush our dreams
# Two of the largest in the industry, erased from the scene
# And I don't wanna be a target so I got with a team
# They got a glow around their body and do shit you've never seen,
# know what I mean?
# Take it deep like summer eves, that's what we do, only humans
# Tryin to get through the world with no confusion
# When you close your eyes, can you state the pain, the misery
# Bringin for you will rescue me
# These are the ways of the world
# Now I have to choose between life or lose my sanity
# Go with the streets keep callin me
# These are the ways of the world

# Alfie please use your brain
# Surely there's some walls out there that you can go and spray,

# Oh little brother please refrain from doing that,

# Check one
# I don't like the radio
# I don't like tv
# They're selling so much sh** these days
# And this sh** is not who I want to be
# I don't like officials
# Using rank to pretend they're not crooks
# I don't like the tricks played on kids
# In those sh**ty teen metal books
# I don't like my heros
# To kill themselves with the drugs
# I don't think sucess
# Can fill you up when you need love
# I don't like the w****s
# That try to f*** you for your game
# I don't like my childhood
# And do not need someone else to blame
# This is the channel I'm dialed into

# For whenever you get lost
# Or you need an excuse to coverup your intentions
# You hate that I express how I'm feeling
# You hate that you relate to this sh**
# You hate that I'm a tick
# A motherf***ing tick

# If you could take a minute of your life
# A certain minute when you feel the lightning strike
# Danger is the only level of that moment
# But it's your moment and you know you'll f***ing own it.
# Glorified in the grace by your victory
# When your done, you escape without memory
# Blindfolded through this life as we learn
# And consequences when the wrong pages turn
# It's an E! true hollywood story
# Take a man down with his own glory

# At some point we come down from the highs
# It's no big deal we move on with our lives
# And some of us let the last color cries
# Do the math, you can laugh when I die
# If life is just a fantasy life then could you
# Live this fantasy life for soemthing would you
# Just remember that the doors are not closable
# And the mother f***ing heroes are disposable

# Because I'm living a bad dream,
# Cause I'll be, With no react,
# Somewho i've run right off track,
# So insane, of the mundane,
# It makes me wanna scream,
# It's a day in life, it'a a link in tha chain,
# Beginning the end, they both look the same, round and round,
# No new ground, it's a day life, and were down to the game,
# Winning or losing, there nothing to gane, round and round,
# No new ground,
# It's the day in the life,
# It's just so, simplistic,
# Trying to be optimistic,
# That part of me won't give up hope,
# Well it my own,
# Disfuction,
# That always leads to nothing,
# But it seems,
# It's the only way,
# The only way to go,
# [Chorus 1x]
# Cause nothing ever changes anymore,
# It makes me wonder what tomorrow for,

# So much confusion

# Broken off again
# And I'm only not lonely when I'm lonely by myself

# Keep holding my breath while I'm trying to breathe
# Swimming against all of my waves and rapids
# I only win when I'm losing

# I need to breathe just one breath
# Walls are closing in so fast
# Privacy's hard to find
# Eyes are watching all the time
# [chorus 2x]
> Lindsay Lohan
# You're the kind of friend who always bends
# When I'm broken
# Like remember when
# You took my heart, and put it back together again
# I've been wasting time with clueless guys, but now it's over
# Let me tell you why
# I'm through
# I've met someone new
# Who's just like you
# [chorus]
# You're it, you're the ultimate
# It's automatic, I'm sure of it
# No lie, so don't even try
# To tell me that you're not the guy
# Cause I've been waiting all my life
# For someone just like you
# But you're it, you're the ultimate, you
# You're the kind of guy, whose hand in mine
# Sends shivers up and down my spine
# You took my heart, and put it back together again
# You're the kind of guy that blows my mind
# But now it's my turn
# It's been right in front of me
# Everything I need
# Why didn't I see
# [chorus]
# You're it, you're the ultimate
# It's automatic, I'm sure of it

# Saying everything I’ve said before
# All these words, they make no sense
# I found bliss in ignorance
# Less I hear, the less you say
# But you'll find that out anyway
# I find the answers aren't so clear
# Wish I could find a way to disappear
# All these thoughts, they make no sense

# Nothing seems to go away
# Over and over again (x5)

# Break!
# These are the places where I can't feel
# Torn from my body, my flesh it heals
# During this ride we can cut up what we like
# Waiting alone I can not resist
# Feeling this hate I have never missed
# Please someone give me a reason to rip off my face

# I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
# Shining with the light from the sun
# The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
# The moon's going to owe it one
# It makes me think of how you act to me you do
# Favors and then rapidly you just
# Turn around and start asking me about
# Things you want back from me
# I'm sick of the tension
# Sick of the hunger
# Sick of you acting like I owe you this
# Find another place to feed your greed
# While I find a place to rest
# I want to be in another place
# I hate when you say you don't understand
# You'll see it's not meant to be
# I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
# A place for my head
# Maybe someday I'll be just like you and
# Step on people like you do
# And run away all the people I thought I knew
# I remember back then who you were
# You used to be calm used to be strong
# Used to be generous but you should've known that you'd
# Wear out your welcome now you see
# How quiet it is all alone I'm so
# Sick of the tension sick of the hunger
# Sick of you acting like I owe you this

# Where should I start?
# Disjointed heart
# I’ve got no commitment
# To my own flesh and blood
# Left all alone
# Far from my home
# No one to hear me, to heal my ill heart, I
# Keep it locked up inside
# Cannot express
# To the point I’ve regressed
# If anger’s a gift, then I guess I’ve been blessed, I
# Keep it locked up inside
# Keep my distance from your lies
# its too late to love me now
# you have never showed me
# its too late to love me now
# you dont even know me
# Breaking a part of my heart to find release
# Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
# Breaking a part of my heart to find release
# Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
# Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break)
# Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me)
# Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Too)

# Keep my distance
# Keep my distance
# Keep my distance
# Keep my distance
# Spit drips in the jar, the witless witness
# Cryptic colloquialism shifts your midrift
# Dark all I do embark the shadows,
# Involved with my thought catalogue, analogue, rap catalogue
# Keep my distance, and fear resistance, hurt by persistance,
# The twisted web of tangled lies strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste the taste
# And I'm forced to face these hate crimes against the state of being
# Feeling the weightlessness pressed between the ceiling, reeling around room,
# Riding a bubble of sound proof,
# it's the frequency making you shake-shake with every boom
# Involuntary muscle contraction,
# ignoring and drinking musical gas fume euphoria
# The sound pounds to make the dead flush
# to have you a head rush
# with red thoughts and said stuff.

# Hahaha
# You're wasting your talent, randy
# It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
# It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
# It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
# It's like the face inside is right...
# Why does it look like night today?
# Something in here's not right today
# Why am I so uptight today?
# Paranoia's all I got left
# I don't know what stressed me first
# Or how the pressure was fed
# But, I know just what it feels like
# To have a voice in the back of my head
# It's like a face that I hold inside
# A face that awakes when I close my eyes
# A face that watches every time I lie
# A face that laughs every time I fall
# (And watches everything)
# So I know that, when it's time to sink or swim
# That the face inside is hearing me
# Right underneath my skin
# It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
# It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
# It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
# It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
# You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
# Cause I dont fucking need em
# Take 'em out the 'hood, keep 'em lookin good
# But I dont fucking feed 'em
# First time they fuss I'm breezing, talking about: "What's the reason?"
# I'm a pimp in every sense of the word bitch
# Better trust and believe him
# In the cut where I keep 'em
# Til I need a nut, til I need to beat the guts
# Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin em up
# Let em play with the dick in the truck
# Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
# Divorce him and split his bucks
# Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread
# So you can be livin it up? Shit I..
# Parts with nothin, y'all be frontin

# Crawling in my skin

# Folks, we have
# A very special guest
# For you tonight
# I'd like to introduce:
# Mr. Hahn
# Let's hear it for
# The great Mr. Hahn
# And now for a lesson in
# Rhythm management
# Let's begin
# All right now,
# Wasn't that fun?
# Let's try something else
> Linkin Park
# I have a dream of a scene between the green hills
# Clouds pull away and the sunlight's revealed
# People don't talk about keeping it real
# It's understood that they actually will
# And intoxicated and stimulated emcees
# Staring in the trees, paranoid, or caught in the breeze
# Watch them flee, hip-hop hits
# Take a walk with me and what you'll see
# Is a land where the sand is made up of crushed up wax
# And the sky beyond you is krylon blue
# And everybody speaks in a dialect of rhyme
# And emcees have left materialism behind them
# Meanwhile I just grip my mic
# And hope me and my team make it through alright
# Because say what you will, and say what you might
# But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night
# Because this is dedicated to the kids
# Dedicated to where the music lives
# Dedicated to those tired of the same old scene
# And dedicated to the people advanced in the game
# What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
# What's real is the kids who think they don't belong
# What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
# Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun
# I've seen a lot of shit, I've talked to a bum
# Out on sunset strip, he asked me How would you feel
# If everybody acted like you didn't exist
# You'd lose your grip, probably eventually flip.
# So let it be known, the only reason that we do this
# So that you can pick it up and just bang your head to it
# While emcees fight to see who can be the commonist
# Be floatin overhead like a space odyssey monolith
# Over seeing the game, over being part of the same old thing
# It's all gonna change in a hurricane of darkness and pain
# And acidic rain and promises that you won't do it again
# Meanwhile I just grip my mic
# And hope me and my team make it through alright
# Because say what you will, and say what you might
# But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night
# Because this is dedicated to the kids
# Dedicated to where the music lives
# Dedicated to those tired of the same old scene
# And dedicated to the people advanced in the game
# What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
# What's real is the kids who think they don't belong
# What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
# Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun
# Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside
# This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide
# Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside
# This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide
# This is dedicated to the kids
# Dedicated to where the music lives
# Dedicated to those tired of the same old scene
# And dedicated to the people advanced in the game
# What's real, everybody who doesn't feel safe
# What's real, everybody who knows they're out of place
# What's real, anybody with nowhere to run
# Will hide in the shadows waiting for the sun

# I ordered a frappachino.
# Where's my f***ing frappachino?
# Alright, let's do this.
# When I pretend everything is what I want it to be,
# I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see,
# When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am,
# Stealin’ second after second just ‘cause I know I can,
# But I can’t pretend this is the way it’ll stay,
# I’m just trying to bend the truth,
# I can’t pretend I’m who you want me to be,
# So I’m lying my way from..
# If you feelin' like a pimp Ni***, go and brush your shoulders off,
# Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off,
# Ni**** is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you,
# Get, that, dirt off your shoulder.
# I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force,
# Tryin' to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche,
# Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced,
# Middle finger to the law, Ni***, grippin' my balls,
# All the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin',
# All the ballers is bouncin' they like the way I be leanin',
# All the rappers be hatin', off the track that I'm makin',
# But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it,
# Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pops,
# Ni*** London, Japan and I'm straight off the block,
# Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block,
# I can run it back, Ni***, cause I'm straight with the Roc.
# If you feelin' like a pimp Ni***, go and brush your shoulders off,
# Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off,
# Niggaz is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you,
# Get, that, dirt off your shoulder
# You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder,
# You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder,
# You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder,
# You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder.
# Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
# I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
# Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir,
# Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya,
# But like, fifty-two cards when I'm, I'm through dealin,
# Now, fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em,
# Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling,
# In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin',
# With a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve,
# At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen,
# I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean,
# No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real.
# Yeah, I remember what they taught to me,
# Remember condescending talk of who I outta be,
# Remember listenin’ to all of that and this again,
# So I pretended up a person who was fittin’ in,
# And now you think this person really is me,
# And I’m trying to bend the truth,
# But, the more I push, the more I’m pullin’ away,
# ‘Cause I’m lying my way from you.
# (No turning back now),
# I wanna be pushed aside,
# So let me go,
# (No, no turning back now),
# Lemme take back my life,
# I’d rather be all alone,
# (No turning back now),
# Anywhere on my own,
# ‘Cause I can see,
# (No, no turning back now),
# The very worst part of you,
# The very worst part of you,
# Is me.
# This isn’t what I wanted to be,
# I never thought that what I said,
# Would have you running from me,
# Like this,
# This isn’t what I wanted to be,
# I never thought that what I said,
# Would have you runnin’ from me,
# Like this (like this),

# It's easier to run
# Replacing this pain with something numb
# It's so much easier to go
# Than face all this pain here all alone
# Something has been taken
# From deep inside of me
# A secret I’ve kept locked away
# No one can ever see
# Wounds so deep they never show
# They never go away
# Like moving pictures in my head
# For years and years they've played
# If I could change I would
# Take back the pain I would
# Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
# If I could stand up and take the blame I would
# If I could take all the shame to the grave I would
# If I could change I would
# Take back the pain I would
# Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
# If I could stand up and take the blame I would
# I would take all my shame to the grave
# It's easier to run
# Replacing this pain with something numb
# It's so much easier to go
# Than face all this pain here all alone
# Sometimes I remember
# The darkness of my past
# Bringing back these memories
# I wish I didn’t have
# Sometimes I think of letting go
# And never looking back
# And never moving forward so
# There would never be a past
# If I could change I would
# Take back the pain I would
# Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
# If I could stand up and take the blame I would
# If I could take all the shame to the grave I would
# If I could change I would
# Take back the pain I would
# Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
# If I could stand up and take the blame I would
# I would take all my shame to the grave
# Just washing it aside
# All of the helplessness inside
# Pretending I don't feel misplaced
# Is so much simpler than change
# It's easier to run
# Replacing this pain with something numb
# It's so much easier to go
# Than face all this pain here all alone
# It's easier to run
# If I could change I would
# Take back the pain I would
# Retrace every wrong move that I made
# It's so much easier to go
# If I could change I would
# Take back the pain I would

# One thing I don't know why
# it doesn't even matter how hard you try
# keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time.
# all I know, time was just slipping way
# and I watched it count down till the end of the day
# watched it watch me and the words that I say
# the echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
# I know that I didn't look down below
# and I watched the time go right out the window
# trying to grab hold, trying not to watch
# I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
# but in the end no matter what I pretend
# the journey is more important than the end or the start
# and what it meant to me will eventually be
# a memory of the time when
# I tried so hard
# and got so far
# but in the end
# it doesn’t even matter
# I had to fall
# to lose it all
# but in the end
# it doesn’t even matter
# yo one thing, one thing I don't know why
# it doesn't even matter how hard you try
# keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time
# all I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party
# all for shake and made eye contact
# party control showing all that
# northeast, southwest coast
# stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle
# I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder
# I brought you back of the thing
# like the imaginary man of your dreams
# well, you would always seem to make it worth it
# a sleek skin I never nerved you
# you felt lovin, I never applied a room
# without bringing the plan
# by any means and means of leaving you teens,
# of all those teenage scenes
# I tried so hard
# and got so far
# but in the end
# it doesn’t even matter
# I had to fall
# to lose it all
# but in the end
# it doesn’t even matter
# Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Mo Motion Man

# Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Motion Man
# Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kurt
# one thing I don't know how
# it doesn't even matter when you look at it now
# because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all
# scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl
# and I was forced to run, with you mocking me
# stopping me, back stabbing me constantly
# remembering all the times you fought with me
# watch the clock now chock full of hypocrisy
# and now your mouth wishes it could inhale
# every single little thing you said and make it expel
# every single little sputter just to get your piece,
# but it really doesn't matter to me
# because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend
# the journey is more important than the end or the start
# and what it meant to me will eventually be
# a memory of the time when
# I tried so hard
# and got so far
# but in the end
# it doesn’t even matter
# I had to fall
# to lose it all
# but in the end
# it doesn’t even matter..
# in the end…

# Would distract me when
# I think of how I shot myself in the back again

# A spot of light floods the floor
# And pours over the rusted world of pretend
# The eyes ease open and its dark again

# In the memory you'll find me
# Eyes burning up
# The darkness holding me tightly
# Until the sun rises up
# Moving all around
# Screaming of the ups and downs
# Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
# The wheels go round and the sunset creeps past the
# Street lamps, chain-link, and concrete
# A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
# Floats on down the street till the wind is gone
# The memory now is like the picture was then
# When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again

# You've cross the line
# What goes up will surely fall, and I'm counting down the time
# Cause I've had so many stand-offs with you
# Its about as much as I can stand
# So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine
# One minute your on top
# The next your not, watch it drop
# Making your heart stop
# Just before you hit the floor
# One minute your on top
# The next your not, missed your shot
# Making your heart stop
# You think you've won
# And then it's all gone
# And then it’s all gone
# And then it’s all gone
# And then it’s all gone
# Now it’s all gone
# I know I'll never trust a single thing you say
# You knew your lies would divide us but you lied anyway
# And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
# But what goes up is got to fall
# One minute your on top
# The next your not, watch it drop
# Making your heart stop
# Just before you hit the floor
# One minute your on top
# The next your not, missed your shot
# Making your heart stop
# You think you've won
# And then it's all gone
# And then it’s all gone
# And then it’s all gone
# And then it’s all gone
# Now it’s all gone

# One thing / I don't know why
# It doesn't even matter how hard you try
# Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
# To explain in due time
# All I know
# time is a valuable thing
# Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
# Watch it count down to the end of the day
# The clock ticks life away
# It's so unreal
# Didn't look out below
# Watch the time go right out the window
# Trying to hold on / but didn't even know
# Wasted it all just to
# Watch you go
# I kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
# What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I tried
# so hard
# One thing / I don't know why
# Doesn't even matter how hard you try
# Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
# To explain in due time
# I tried so hard
# In spite of the way you were mocking me
# Acting like I was part of your property
# Remembering all the times you fought with me
# I'm surprised it got so far
# Things aren't the way they were before
# You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
# Not that you knew me back then
# But it all comes back to me
# In the end
# You kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
# What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I
# I tried so hard
# And got so far
# But in the end
# It doesn't even matter
# I had to fall
# And lose it all
# But in the end
# It doesn't even matter
# I put my trust in you
# Pushed as far as I can go
# And for all this
# There's only one thing you should know
> Linkin Park
# It starts with one..
# and multiplies 'til you can taste the sun
# and burnt by the sky you try to take it from.
# but if it falls theres no place to run
# crumbling down, It's so unreal...
# They're dealing you in to determine your end
# and sending you back again to places you've been
# and bending your will, til it breaks you within
# and still they fill their eyes...
# With the twilight through the skylight
# and the highlights on a frame of steel.
# See the brightness of your likeness
# as I write this on a pad
# with the way I feel...
# Hear the screaming in my dreaming
# as its seeming that you've played your part.
# like you're heartless take apart this
# in the darkness while I know that..
# I tried so hard, and got so far,
# but in the end it doesn't even matter.
# I had to fall to lose it all,
# but in the end it doesn't even matter.
# I've looked down the line and what's there is not what ought to be.
# Held back by the battles they fought for me,
# Calling me to be part of their property,
# and now I see that I get no chance...
# I get no break; fakes and snakes quickly lead to mistakes
# and as the tightrope within slowly starts to thin
# I can only hope that they close their eyes...
# To the twilight through the skylight
# and the highlights on a frame of steel.
# See the brightness of your likeness
# as I write this on a pad
# with the way I feel...
# Hear the screaming in my dreaming
# as its seeming that you've played your part.
# like you're heartless take apart this
# in the darkness while I know that..
# I tried so hard, and got so far,
# but in the end it doesn't even matter.
# I had to fall to lose it all,
# but in the end it doesn't even matter.
# I've put my trust in you
# pushed as far as I can go

# The rhythm projects 'round the next sound
# Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now
# Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down
# The melting pot of a super-futuresque style
# The combination of a vocal caress
# With lungs that gasp for breath
# From emotional stress
# With special effects
# And a distorted collage
# Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage
# It's going down

# The separation narrowed down to a fine line
# To blur the edges so they blend together properly

# The sword with the pen
# The mightiest is the weapons
# Swinging right from the chin
# The elevate of mental states
# Long gone with the wind
# To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends
# It's going down
# Style assimilation readily
# Trekking through the weaponry
# Of the pure pedigree
# Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me
# Whatever the weather be
# We invent the steadily
# It's going down to sub-terrestrial high
# I rhyme regiment that's calling the shots
# Execution of collaborative plots
# Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop

# Become so tired so much more aware
# I'm becoming this all I want to do
# Is be more like me and be less like you
# And I know
# I may end up failing too
# But I know
# You were just like me with someone disappointed in you
# I've become so numb I can't feel you there
# Become so tired so much more aware
# I'm becoming this all I want to do
# Is be more like me and be less like you
# I've become so numb I can't feel you there
# I'm tired of being what you want me to be
# I've become so numb I can't feel you there
# I'm tired of being what you want me to be

# We stood upon the edge
# Eyes fixed in the sky
# Just before twilight
# Claimed the lights
# Wind carried voices
# Over the waters
# From a whisper
# Into a scream
# We got this one night to make it real
# For tomorrow is too far from here
# The words that we cast
# Into eternity
# They still echo in my ears
# And in my dreams
# So meet me tonight
# In the place that time forgot
# And take with you
# All that you can't leave behind
# We got this one night to make it real
# For tomorrow is too far from here
# Headlights open
# The road ahead
# They can't light up the sky
# But they can light our way
# We got this one night to make it real
# For tomorrow is too far from here

# I cannot take this anymore
# I'm saying everything I've said before
# All these words they make no sense
# I find bliss in ignorance
# Less I hear the less you'll say
# You'll find that out anyway
# Just like before...
# Everything you say to me
# Takes me one step closer to the edge
# And I'm about to break
# I need a little room to breathe
# Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
# I'm about to break
# I find the answers aren't so clear
# Wish I could find a way to disappear
# All these thoughts they make no sense
# I find bliss in ignorance
# Nothing seems to go away
# Over and over again
# Just like before
# Everything you say to me
# Takes me one step closer to the edge
# And I'm about to break
# I need a little room to breathe
# Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
# I'm about to break
# Everything you say to me
# Takes me one step closer to the edge
# And I'm about to break
# I need a little room to breathe
# Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
# And I'm about to break
# Shut up when I'm talking to you
# Shut up, Shut up, Shut up
# Shut up when I'm talking to you
# Shut up, Shut up, Shut up
# Shut up, I’m about to break!
# Everything you say to me
# Takes me one step closer to the edge
# And I'm about to break
# I need a little room to breathe
# Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
# I'm about to break

# Takes me one step closer to the edge

# In the end, there was nothing to say.
# I can't look for any other way.
# This feeling is takin over day by day.
# Don't tell me if your right cause this
# is the last time you;ll even see the light.
# chorus: Open your eyes, open your heart
# cause we'll never break apart. Keep it or
# use it for an ending that fits. Nothing is here
# so theres nothing to fear.
# This sucks that this is not working
# cause all your doin is twerking. Like
# all them other people you talk too much
# and your not even in a bunch. Looking every
# where and nothings here. With you it's a nightmare.
# In my mind all I see is you actually fair.
# No I've done this to you too much
# that I can't take it anymore. My heart
# is poor and sore without you and you
# just walking up that pew with only few.
# Take this and I will no where and say
# this OPEN YOUR EYES!

# Why does it feel like night today?
# Something in here's not right today.
# Why am I so uptight today?
# Paranoia's all I got left
# I don't know what stressed me first
# Or how the pressure was fed / but
# I know just what it feels like
# To have a voice in the back of my head
# It's like a face that I hold inside
# A face that awakes when I close my eyes
# A face watches every time I lie
# A face that laughs every time I fall
# [And watches everything]
# So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
# That the face inside is hearing me / right underneath my skin
# It's like I'm / paranoid lookin' over my back
# It's like a / whirlwind inside of my head
# It's like I / can't stop what I'm hearing within
# It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
# I know I've got a face in me
# points out all my mistakes to me
# You've got a face on the inside too and
# Your paranoia's probably worse
# I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand
# Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
# I can't add up to what you can but

# A face watches every time they lie
# A face that laughs every time they fall

# Part of me won't go away
# Everyday reminded how much I hate it
# Weighted against the consequences
# Can't lift the doubt so it's senseless
# Wanna cut it out of my soul
# And just live with a gaping hole
# Take control of my life
# And wash out all the burnt taste
# I made the problems in the first place
# Hang my head low cause it's part of me
# You hardly see right next to the heart of me
# Hurting me, the routine scar
# New cuts cover where the old ones are
# And I'm sick of this
# I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity
# I rather not even be then the man
# that's staring in the mirror through me
# Cut myself free willingly
# Stop just what's killing me
# Cut myself free willingly
# Stop just what's killing me
# Cut myself free willingly
# Stop just what's killing me
# Cut myself free willingly
# Stop just what's killing me
# I feel it everyday
# I feel I made my way
# I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
# Swallowing me
# (freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it)
# Once it's been dealt with you
# feel like you've been touched by something angelic
# And then melted down into a pool of peace
# Cease to be the animal you used to be
# Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
# And feel the karma when the problem's all gone
# And then you start to see another piece of yourself
# that you can't let be
# Memories of the last fight to free yourself
# Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well
# And now you know you can choose
# to lose the part in your heart
# Where your insides bruise
# You can live if you're willing to
# Put a stop to just what's killing you
# Cut myself free willingly
# Stop just what's killing me
# Cut myself free willingly
# Stop just what's killing me
# Cut myself free willingly
# Stop just what's killing me
# Cut myself free willingly
# Stop just what's killing me
# I feel it everyday
# I feel I made my way
# I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
# Swallowing me
# Alive in me, inside of me, a part of me screams away silently
# This part of me won't go away, part of me won't go away
# Everywhere I look around I see how everyone aught to be
# Every time I see myself
# there's always something wrong
# I feel it everyday
# I feel I made my way
# I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
# Swallowing me
# I feel it everyday
# I feel I made my way
# I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
# Swallowing me
# I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside, swallowing me

# Forcefully, the power of suggestion

# Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
# And as wheels go round the sunset creeps past the
# Street lamps, cars, chain-links, and concrete
# A wind open grows and captures the eye
# Cry's out yellow light as it passes it by
# A small black figure sits in front of a box
# Inside a box a rock with the needles on top
# Nothing stops in the slanted the chain
# The brains lose not knowing they were part of the game
# And the insides go but the box stays the same
# And shame, shovel up the pieces to the pain
# You could try to hide yourself in the world of pretend
# When the paper's crumbled up it can't be perfect again

# Notes: Mike created the majority of this instumental song
# in the back of the bus in pro tools recording software.
# It felt unfinished for over a year...until Brad, Phoenix,
# and Joe put their touches on it while in the studio at NRG.
# Months later, the band and mixer Andy Wallace adding
# a new dynamic to the song with quick panning accents
# in the turntable solo, most noticeable when listening in headphones.

# I close both locks below the window.
# I close both blinds and turn away.
# Sometimes solutions aren’t so simple.
# Sometimes goodbye’s the only way.
# And the sun will set for you
# the sun will set for you.
# And the shadow of the day,
# Will embrace the world in grey,
# And the sun will set for you...
# In cards and flowers on your window,
# Your friends all plead for you to stay.
# Sometimes beginnings aren’t so simple.
# Sometimes goodbye’s the only way.
# And the sun will set for you,
# the sun will set for you.
# And the shadow of the day,
# Will embrace the world in gray,
# And the sun will set for you..
# And the shadow of the day,

# When this began I had nothing to say
# And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
# (I was confused)
# And I let it all out to find that
# I'm not the only person with these things in mind
# (Inside of me)
# but all the vacancy the words revealed
# Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
# (Nothing to lose)
# Just stuck, hollow and alone
# And the fault is my own
# And the fault is my own
# I want to heal, I want to feel
# What I thought was never real
# I want to let go of the pain I've held so long
# (Erase all the pain till it's gone)
# I want to heal, I want to feel
# Like I'm close to something real.
# I want to find something I've wanted all along
# Somewhere I belong
# And I've got nothing to say
# I cant believe I didn’t fall right down on my face
# (I was confused)
# looking everywhere only to find that it's
# Not the way I had imagined it all in my mind.
# (So what am I)
# What do I have but negativity
# Cause I cant justify the way everyone is looking at me
# (Nothing to lose)
# Nothing to gain, hollow and alone

# I want to heal, I want to feel
# Like I'm close to something real
# I want to find something I've wanted all along
# Somewhere I belong
# I will never know
# Myself until I do this on my own

# Anything else until my wounds are healed
# I will never be
# Anything 'til I break away from me

# I'll find myself today

# Watch as the room rocks
# Mentally moonwalk
# Mixed media slang bangin' in your boombox
# Verbal violence
# Lyrical stylist
# In a time when rock/hip-hop rhymes are childish
# You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
# Rappin' to a beat doesn't make you an MC
# With your lack of skill and facility you're killing me
# And a DJ in the group just for credibility
# I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes
# You're not an MC if someone else writes your lines
# And rappin' over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
# 'Cause rock and hip-hop been collaboratin' for years
# But now they're getting randomly mixed-and-matched up
# All after a fast buck
# And all the tracks suck
# So how does it stack up? None of it's real
# You wanna be an MC you gotta study the skill
# who can rock a rhyme like this?
# bring it to you every time like this
# who can rock a rhyme like this?
# step, step up, step, step up
# So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
# But mentally you don't have the hip-hop energy
# With a tendency to make up stories
# It sounded like the only hip-hop you heard was Top 40 (Top 40)
# And your record company's completely missin' it
# And all the kids are dissin' it for not bein' legitimate
# So in a battle you can't hack it
# React with whack shit
# And get smacked with verbal backflips
# Get your ass kicked with a fabulous battle catalyst
# It's taken decades for MCs to establish this
# You're new to hip-hop
# And welcome if your serious
# But not on the mic - leave that to the experienced

# Using waves of sound,
# the true master paralyzes his opponet,

# Do I follow my fate to escape blindly
# Do I hide my pride away from these bad dreams

# Or do I try to catch them red-handed
# Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness

# If I hide my pride and lie sleepless
# I wont be able to cope with my weakness

# To the cold of the static
# And put my cold feet on the floor
# Forgot all about yesterday
# Remembering I’m pretending to be
# Where I’m not anymore
# A little taste of hypocrisy
# And I’m left in the wake of the mistake
# Slow to react
# And even though your so close to me
# Your still so distant
# And I cant bring you back
# It's true the way I feel
# Was promised by your face
# The sound of your voice
# Painted on my memories
# Even if you're not with me
# I’m with you
# You now I see keeping everything inside (with you)
# You now I see even when I close my eyes (with you)
# I hit you and you hit me back
# We fall to the floor
# The rest of the day stands still
# Fine line between this and that
# When things go wrong
# I pretend that the past isn’t real
# I’m trapped in this memory
# And I’m left in the wake of the mistake
# Slow to react
# So even though your close to me
# Your still so distant
# And I can't bring you back

# Was promised by your face

# It's been this many years
# It's been that many years
# And still have to ask the same question
# Why?
# Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night
# When you and me would kiss at night
# Remember what we tripped like
# Why don't it feel like felt on the first night
# Now it's so hard to find two words to say
# Funny me, funny you
# Don't have nothing lft in common
# You wanted me to have your heart
# Now you want it back
# What about the promise you made to me
# That you wouldn't trade the key in for no damn reason
# And suddenly we're flying high
# Now it's Mayday we're falling fast
# You're trying to get lost
# I'm trying to pull up
# And damn I can't say
# You said you didn't need me
# I really didn't think that you would leave me
# Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night
# When you and me would kiss at night
# Remember what we tripped like
# Why don't it feel like felt on the first night
# Now it's so hard to find two words to say
# Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night
# When we were saying things like where have you been all my life
# Why don't it feel like felt on the first night
# Now it's so hard to find two words to say
# Now the kids are looking at me like I'm to blame
# No longer got their respect for me
# Don't want to hear what I'm saying
# I know how it feels to be ashamed
# Cause when I was young I felt that pain too
# And I can't say nothing that would cause you to make a change
# And that's the reason that we're going our separate ways
# Then who am I fooling
# What am I doing thinking you love me
# Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night
# When you and me would kiss at night
# Remember what we tripped like
# Why don't it feel like felt on the first night
# Now it's so hard to find two words to say
# Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night
# When we were saying things like where have you been all my life
# Why don't it feel like felt on the first night
# Now it's so hard to find two words to say
# You would think by this time I would get it right
# Know the schemes and the things that make it be right
# When you said you could stay no longer
# I thought I had just a little more daylight
# LIke when we use to turn a fight into a good night
# I know the things I use to do to make you feel right
# I would give anything the fortune I made
# To bring back the days that the feeling was so right
# Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night
# When you and me would kiss at night

# With so much joy and love in demand
# Why can't we get it right and understand
# The world is a party
# Look at the faces out there everywhere
# There is a happiness we all can share
# Walk in the sunshine come out the rain
# It's time to face the truth that we're all the same
# It's so right it can't be wrong
# All you got to do is come along
# It's our time to celebrate
# Tonight it's gonna be that way

# Hey, I hope you feel the same way I feel
# Cause tonight
# The moon, the stars, this moment so real
# To once
# We have every thing
# Our hearts have a song to sing
# We now know that dream's come true
# Cause now there's me and you

# Didn't we have the time of our life tonight
# Didn't we dance the night away

# You make life a holiday
# Let's go and play

# So you face it with a smile
# There is no need to cry
# For a trifle's more than this
# Will you still recall my name
# And the month it all began
# Will you release me with a kiss
# Have I tried to draw the veil
# If I have, how could I fail
# Did I fear the consequence
# Dazed by careless words
# Cosy in my mind
# I don't mind
# I think so
# I will let you go
# I don't mind
# I think so
# I will let you go
# Now you shaped that liquid wax
# Fit it out with crater cracks
# Sweet devotion my delight
# Oh, you're such a pretty one
# And the naked thrills of flesh and skin
# Would tease me through the night
# Now I hate to leave you bare
# If you need me I'll be there
# Don't you ever let me down
# Dazed by careless words
# Cosy in my mind

# You want to suffer and show me you're angry.
# Fight with your fists up or call for you mommy.
# You want to suffer and show me you're angry.
# Spend time alone, find a stick in the basement.
# Drink water and gold dust and live on impatience.

# I should never have to chase you.
# I was the one who got away.
# If you could feel the pain your confusion has caused me

# Lyrically longing, she's tearing the words from the page.
# She's fearfully seething.
# "Bring me your blessings, a prayer, or a new pen.
# - You don't know what I need."
# "Look in my bed and I'm bound to be sleeping,
# I'm lying there dead, but I'm breathing.

# And I don't want to drown in my dreams
# Bring me wild plums and agrimony
# I bet you don't even know what that means."

> Lisa Marie Presley
# One day well on one tombstone
# All our names should go
# We shared a life
# The beauty and the ugliness
# Through all we've been and with
# The birth of a child
# Thanks for throwing me the line when I've lost sight of it
# You're the only reason I can exhale
# And now, suddenly, oh, when I find that the outcome's just not right
# From what I just did
# You're the only thing I can breathe through
# You're heaven, my sweet friends, a few lines of poetry
# It may be laughable, but thanks for laughing with me
# Yes, and the next time I wrap myself around a tree
# And I know that you'll be there with bells on
# Yeah, to pull me off
# And you can tell me a story I've heard before
# I'll insult your mother
# Then you can tell me where to go
# [Chorus (x2)]

# Imagine that I can't be comforted at all
# In pieces I went from crawling into a ball
# Evidence, it's in my breathing every day
# Less and less and less
# Hey you - you wore me out
# There was nothing left for anybody else
# Listen you, you're the last little sh** that anyone expected
# Could put me through this
# Yeah it's true
# Turbulence, auto pilot to control
# Down and down and down
# And if he's there then I'll take my order to go
# He shouldn't see, He shouldn't know
# Hey you - you wore me out
# There was nothing left for anybody else
# And you, you're the last little sh** that anyone expected
# Could put me through this
# Yeah f***er it's true
# And over there in the corner of the room
# Sat little Jack Horner in his gloom
# Oh how you like it there
# Na na na na na
# Hey you- you slithered around while you ripped every vein out
# And you - your once so charming self inflicted tortured act
# It's a loser and a poser's tool
# Hey you - you wore me out
# There was nothing left for anybody else
# And you, you're the last little sh** that anyone expected
# Could put me through this

# I get so scared inside - and I don't really understand
# Is it love that's on my mind - or is it fantasy
# Heaven
# Is in the palm of my hand - and it's waiting here for you
# What am I supposed to do with a childhood tragedy
# If I close my eyes forever
# Will it all remain unchanged
# If I close my eyes forever
# Will it all remain the same...
# Sometimes
# It's hard to hold on
# So hard to hold on to my dreams
# It isn't always what is seems
# When you're face to face with me
# You're like a dagger
# And stick me in the heart
# And taste the blood from my blade
# And when we sleep - would you shelter me
# In your warm and darkened grave
# If I close my eyes forever
# Will it all remain unchanged
# If I close my eyes forever
# Will it all remain the same...
# Will you ever take me
# No, I just can't take the pain
# But would you ever trust me
# No, I'll never feel the same...Ohh...
# I know I've been so hard to you
# I know I've told you lies
# If I could have just one more wish
# I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes

# But it's been a long, long time
# I've got a good life now, I've moved on
# So when you cross my mind
# CHORUS
# (I/So/And) try not to think about
# What might have been
# 'Cause that was then
# And we have taken different roads
# We can't go back again, there's no use givin' in
# And there's no way to know
# What might have been
# We could sit and talk about this all night long
# And wonder why we didn't last
# Yes, they might be the best days we will ever know
# But we'll have to leave them in the past
# CHORUS
# That same old look in your eyes
# It's a beautiful night
# I'm so tempted to stay
# But too much time has gone by
# We should just say goodbye
# And turn and walk away
# CHORUS
# No, we'll never know
> Little Texas
# The moon is off my shoulder
# The sun is in my eyes
# Almost to my hometown
# It's just another mile
# Memories surround me of an old familiar time
# Life was simple then, when your love was mine
# CHORUS:
# There's a cool wind on the desert tonight
# I can almost see your golden hair flying in the moonlight
# Ooh, it was a restless kind of free
# When it was, you and forever and me
# I pulled off the highway on your side of town
# Make the turn past the railroad tracks as the sun goes down
# I remember how you would wait by the front porch light
# You were always ready to take a midnight ride
# Sometimes love is lost and never found
# But I just had to see if you're still around

# I'm gonna tell my son to join a circus so that death is cheap
# And games are just another way of life
# And I'm gonna tell my son to be a prophet of mistakes
# Because for every truth there are half a million lies
# And I'm gonna lock my son up in a tower till he learns to let his hair down
# Far enough to climb outside
# When they do the double dutch, that's them dancing
# When they do the double dutch, that's them dancing

# As far as I go, funky baby
# Digging deep inside of me
# As far as I know, sister
# I'm alright
# As far as I know, funky lady I'm coming home tonight            you can see though the smoke
# You're an x-ray man
# You got x-ray eyes
# This is no reflection on you            why don't you put on your two-way
# It's just what I see inside                    sombrero and leave
# You're an x-ray man
# You got white wall tires
# Iodine tan
# Cheap, unpleasant desires
# You're an x-ray man
# You got an X-rated mind
# You're not satisfied looking at me
# You're always checking out the girl behind
# You're an x-ray man, you got secret plans for me

# I understand you want canaries on your hand
# Masterpiece Roley, gold tri-color band
# Cute wedding pictures sittin on the nightstand
# You don't wanna make it happen unless it's the right man
# I know you won't touch me unless you trust me
# You kiss me and hug me but still won't crush me
# I'm kissin on your neck real tender
# Gentle as can be, but you still won't surrender
# Let me kiss your eyes
# Let the smell of the incense enhance the vibe
# I pull back to stare at your eyes
# Sittin there quiet like I'm hypnotized
# We kiss a little more, laugh and smile
# Might even share a lollipop, you know my style
# Kick your Charles Davids off, relax for a while
# Let's pretend that we're walkin down the aisle
# I can't explain it
# [Verse Two]
# Straight up, you beautiful B
# I don't think you understand what you doin to me
# On the couch witcha legs crossed, watchin TV
# Shoe hangin off the tip of your foot, you killin me
# Uhh.. then we kiss for real
# I'm fully prepared, I'm already steel
# You go to the bathroom for a second
# I understand baby, I know what you checkin (a-heh-heh)
# That's when you come back and walk to me slow
# That's when you change up and let it all flow
# I'm kissin on your belly ring nice and slow
# I love to take my time, love to give you a show
# Get the warm chocolate syrup to travel below
# Use my ears like handlebars, take control
# Ain't no sense in stayin calm and playin the role
# Baby relax, let me touch your soul
# I can't explain it
# [Verse Three]
# My turn to get rocked, lifted out my socks
# with sound effects and whatnot (mmm)
# A little perfume above the right spot, just a touch
# Never too much, I lick it like a Dutch
# Two of my favorite numbers, you know what I mean
# Add 'em up and they equal fifteen
# You the 6... I needed you like a fix
# I can see it my mind, I knew we was gon' click
# I pick up the pace
# You feel the stubble from my beard on your face
# I look at your lips and take a taste
# Switch it up I got my hands on your waist
# We whylin out, we all over the place
# I'm holdin on with a strong embrace
# You holdin on and tryin to keep the faith
# Together we blast to outer space, I can't explain it

# Repeat 1 (5x)
# Manmade terror
# Hungry jaws of death
# Y'all don't cross my depths
# I'll pause your breaths
# I cause you to sink down forty thousand leagues
# Bleeding to death with no arms and short sleeves
# My world's deep blue
# Killers gotta eat too
# Looking for human flesh to rip my teeth through
# Other fish in the sea but Barracudas ain't equal
# To a half human predator created by a needle
# Jet black eyes baby they stare while you sleep
# When your Titanic sinks I'm the one you gon' meet
# Hearing terrified screams they surround my team
# All you see is trails of blood
# Even God won't intervene
# Nightmares of darkness
# My apetite is heartless
# Even if we related, you eliminated regardless
# In the deep blue, underwater walls
# Half man, half shark
# My jaws don't fall
# Repeat 1 (8x)
# Our Father who art in Heaven
# Hallowed be Thy name
# Killers sworn to beast
# Swallowed them in flames
# They switched my DNA
# Trip me into Cool J
# I can't fight the feeling
# I'm born to kill prey
# To survive an attack
# There's only one way
# Battle to the death
# That's how sharks play
# Weapons left behind
# We dueling with the mind
# You blind, crippled, or crazy
# You're real easy to find
# Struggling to flow with hemorrhages in your throat
# Getting the lap dance while I smash through your boat
# Eat your whole fam
# Nothing left but a right hand
# Clinging to a rail
# Escape, attempts fail
# You'll never make it home
# Tear the flesh off your bone
# Walking in undercurrents is a dangerous zone
# I'm talking death out a moment's notice
# You wasn't focused
# Me and my crew strike
# Like some underwater locusts
# Repeat 1 (8x)
# Uh, uh take it deeper
# Uh, uh take it deeper
# Uh, uh take it deeper
# Uh, uh take it deeper
# These waters are waist level
# The hallway's flooded
# Lost your scuba gear
# The killer's cold-blooded
# His name's LL
# You don't really want it
# I ate your ancestors
# The ocean is haunted
# I'm closing in cause I'm supposed to win
# How the cold steel feel when it froze your chin
# Should of stayed on dry land
# Stroke while you can
# Cause now you under pressure in the land of the damned
# Abandoned pirate ships
# Eels and sod scum
# Fish that glow in the dark
# The Titanic's hub
# Underwater storms
# You're blood is so warm
# You're life vest is off
# And that turns me on
# Killer for centuries
# The Gotti of the deep
# In the next millennium
# I'm still gonna creep
# Sand under my belly, ocean over my head
# Through the light in the shadows
# You become the living dead
# Repeat 1 (12x)

# Surroundin my table, watchin me like cable
# My Dolce hat was low, Versace shades
# Had the Prada shoes on cause the world is a stage
# Lah-lah in the air, it's a sky bar affair
# The glamorous life, I had my glass in the air
# When my eyes connected with somethin real real nice
# Like she finished her drink and started chewin on my ice
# Her smile was bananas, teeth was pearly white
# That's when I realized it'll be a long night
# The vibe was right, she was laced in all white
# Her French manicure traced the crown on my mic
# You ever try to focus, resist with all your might
# But every sip you take pulls you deeper in the hype

# [Verse Two]
# I'm talkin tan lines, belly rings and things
# DJ rubbin my thing, makin my head swing
# All the honies was schemin..

# My vision was blurry, the party was rockin
# The tools was knockin, honey wanna get it poppin
# Try my best to chill, she was fresh out of Brazil
# People was walkin by makin our drinks filled
# What would you do, if you was a Don
# in a position to wild out with a Brazilian blonde?
# Or maybe you a honey and it's hard to keep calm
# Cause you sippin on somethin and homeboy's the bomb

# A family man but hard as a rock
# And I die for my kids so stay off my block
# They might be impressed with you but I'm not
# After all these years I still walk with a bop
# Still keep the ink hot
# Still scheme like a fox
# Still ready to battle
# You don't want your career stopped
# Industry shocked cause I mapped out a plot
# And ran around humble with my joint on cock
# Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all
# Freak freak y'all
# You don't stop
# Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all
# Freak freak y'all
# You don't stop
# Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all
# Freak freak y'all
# You don't stop
# Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all
# Freak freak y'all
# You don't stop

# 1, 2, 3 ‘o’ clock 4 ‘o’ clock ROCK
# 5, 6, 7 ‘o’ clock 8 ‘o’ clock ROCK
# 9, 10, 11 ‘o’ clock 12 ‘o’ clock ROCK
# Gonna ROCK (What?) ROCK, ROCK around the clock
# Three years ago in St. Albans, Queens
# I was rockin at a park called one eighteen
# Little kids stood and watched as I rocked the spot
# Didn’t know that years later I’ll be standin on top
# Livin near Farmers Boulevard I was born and base-shaw
# Stopped the rich and shaked hands with the poor
# And this is a story about a brother I know
# Cut Creator on the fader no watch him go
# (Chorus)
# Go, go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go, go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# (LL Cool J)
# When back in the days before I clocked some dough
# I used to go to the show and sit in the front row
# Hopin and prayin one day I’ll get on the road
# So I had a feeler and a summer and I meet when I’m stoned
# Not fearin a thought, got stung like a horse
# Don’t make fun of my posse, cause each man is a boss
# When his only damn way to pull a jam out the crate
# One time for your mind
# Check out the guitar break
# (Chorus)
# Go, go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go, go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# (LL Cool J)
# This jam just wasn’t enough for Jimmy Hendrix to see
# He could do lessons of mixin take you under his wing
# Straight from the heart cause it ain’t the money that we came here for
# Ain’t no thoughts in the room ain’t breakin no roles
# And in the Rock ‘n’ Roll land, a big strivin plan
# Just my posse learn the vocals what little they had
# It’s all about us three: Eve, Phil & Jay
# He heard Cut Creator cut now check it out to play
# (Chorus)
# Go, go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go, go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# Go Cut Creator Go
# (LL Cool J)
# Rock, rock y’all check out the funky cut
# It’s like travellin through time to the straight cats strut
# Cuts are slicker than Grease needle as sharp as a knife
# We’ll be do doin the doo for the rest of the lines
# Wanna piece of the action, it’s time to party, get up
# Not a subway bummy singer puttin change in a cup
# Wanna see you boogie, oogie jumpin up and down
# Bitin your livin hold your breath until we come to your town
# L-L-C-O-O-L-J-I-S-H-A-R-D-A-S

> Ll Cool J
# I've been watchin' you from afar,
# for as long as I can remmeber
# You are all a real man can need
# and ever ask for
# this is love
# this is more than a crush
# It was all ....(up at Rutgers)
# I saw with your man
# smiling, huh, a coach bag in your hand
# I was laying in the coup with my hat turned back
# we caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
# so skated off, as you strolled off
# looking at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (so fine)
# I gotta take ya from your man that's my mision
# If his love is real he got ta handle competition
# you only knew about 5 months (that's right)
# besides he drinks too much and smokes too many blunts
# and I've been working out everyday thinking bout you
# looking at my own eyes in the rear view
# cathchin flash backs of our eye contact
# wish i could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
# i would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
# I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years
# Chorus
# (2x)hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
# Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
# hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
# I see you at the bus stop waitin everyday
# your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
# but i don't want ta violate your relationship
# so i lay back in the cut with a crush that'a trip
# still he can't stop me from having day dreams
# tounging you down with huh vanilla ice cream
# kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
# searching your body with my tounge girl all night
# I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin into reality
# Our love would come down so naturally
# we would walk down the isle of destiny
# what your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
# break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
# that seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
# but there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
# Hey lover
# CHORUS
# Last week I saw ya at the mall
# standing at the pay phone bout to make a call
# I had a vision it was me on the other end
# telling you come by and then you walked in
# I touched you gently with my hands
# we talked about traveling the distant lands
# escaping all the madness out here in the world
# becomin my wife no longer my girl
# then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
# i kissed you softly and you yearned for more
# we experienced pleasure unparallel
# into an ocean of love we both fell
# swimming in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
# fantasies interchanging with each kiss
# undying passion unities our souls
# togehter we swim until the point of no control
# but its a fantasy it(that,you) won't come true
# we never even spoke and your man (still) love you
# so I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside
# keep my dreams alive until the right time
# CHORUS
> Ll Cool J
# boom bash, wake up, I set it off right
# look around and turn your wet dream to fright night
# you can call me r&b homeys, which stands for rough brother
# word to my grandmother
# I buck you in the head just to let ya know
# stick you for ya dough, spit on the flo'
# drag it out of ya, bring it on
# I smack him back down, yo dope word is bond
# I know you want a piece of the champ
# but you roll too weak, you couldn't make it in my camp
# you thought I went for the flip
# but I'm bustin' off hip-hop clip after clip
# I kept you out there, ripped you for your wear
# jump inside your video, bust you with a chair
# smack slap smack slap smack slap smack
# just to make it worse and hurt your pride I'll run it back
# smack slap smack slap smack slap smack
# click click boom, stop dead in your tracks
# stick the steel in your mouth
# buck buck buck buck buck, lights out
# (I'm comin')
# How ya comin' baby?
# (I'm comin')
# this is how I'm comin'
# the album that I'm comin' with is rough, the flavor's mean
# (ooooh) kickin' you for real in the guillatine
# fourteen shots to your dome kid
# I'm doin' time in the game like a bid
# movin' rhymes like a package
# so stigetty step up and get your nostrils damaged
# shootin', lickin', bustin', sprayin', all of that
# and then some, dead dead dead, one by one
# never step to a real man
# 'cause your rhymes only work on a playground program
# they impress your little friends, bring you a little ends
# but you still you gotta ride in your mans benz
# word to hip-hop, I'm a blast ya
# gotta set you on fire 'cause I gassed ya
# boom, blow, Batman, bang, pow
# unh (what) unh (what), that's the way it's goin' down
# my new album ain't no joke
# you wanna take me out, how many bunch ya smoke?
# I'll never slack again, I'm off the job like the mob
# hey, no prob', many solved, on the knob, make 'em soft drob
# what you gotta deal with is real, made of steel
# you can feel it comin', burnin', buildin', flowin' like an eel
# movin', killin', breakin', servin' you just like a meal
# take off your clothes and taste the steel
# check baby
# rockabye baby on the roof top
# open up your mouth and taste my gallot
# when your jaw breaks your gold teeth will fall
# down will come the monkey, bannana clip and all
# splat (buck buck buck) it's all over wit'
# another plan O.D.'ed over my war hit
# the way I'm workin' and jerkin' and hurtin' brothers converted
# non-beleivers get murdered, 'cause I waffle birded
# get your face out the bill, catch the thrill
# carry a nine put your hootchies on the bill
# the thought of you gettin' scared turns me on
# like my first telivision with my backup tip hard
# so where's your mouth kid? where's your heart shorty?
# it's all over, cash your chips in, crack a forty
# you look thirsty, you ain't gettin' no mercy mercy
# and ain't no way that you can rehearse for me
# murder I wrote, murder I wrote, is what I figure
# it's in my tote, it's in my tote, so I pull the trigger
# put up your women, your crib, your speakers
# your dog, your cat, your crate, your speakers
# your sister, your aunt, your crew, your Knicks
# got 'em booin' all you mother rappers who think that's too tough
# bam bam, here's a hit you wish you had
# a hit that makes you mad, a hit that makes you slap your dad
# dead dead dead, kill dead, kill dead
# try to battle me I gots to buck you in your head
# I pull your file, click
# I know you're good to style, blow
# livin' wild, when it's come to this I never smile
# what did you learn from the lesson I just gave ya?
# obey your momma, be on your best behavior
# it's never endin' and I am recommendin'
# you put your name as Brendan
# I see y'all that is blendin'
# the message that I'm sendin'
# is there ain't no pretendin'
# get in the trunk, buy the album, here I'm endin'
# this is how I'm comin'

# Put me in a Gulf Stream

# Dot the I's cross the T's meticulous
# The coldest winter ever and I'm so icicle-ish
# The movement is flavorful, bags of licorice
# The drop, the rock, the watch, the necklace
# There's no forgettin' this, the way that I'm reppin this

# Knahmsayin? Black Phantom, triple black, with the oak wood
# Gucci shoes, that's how I play
# [Verse One]
# Hold up, I don't gamble, I don't play no craps
# I was taught early on don't jeapordize the stacks
# Before I open my mouth, I get all the facts
# I could never fall off, it's too many hot tracks
# I'm affiliated with too many hot cats
# to end up, crawlin out of a hole in Iraq
# Try to topple my regime
# You end up in need of a scalpel to your spleen
# Is there a medic on the scene?
# Easy children, Queens is in the buildin
# That blank look on your grill'll get filled in
# Slow down baby, you actin like a clown homes
# You get your fronts remodeled like a brownstone
# You hear my heat rock comin through your sheetrock
# It means you're OD'n homeboy, here come the detox
# I get my swagger on, proud as a peac***
# Bars is hot, beats is pumpin like a ? box
# Shake it baby shake it
# If you a real O.G. put your hands in the air with me, c'mon

# Divided we fall, stay together and forever we ball, c'mon
# Shake it baby shake it
# You do it for the gangsters
# I do it for the ladies, but it's all money baby
# [Verse Two]
# They pay me so much it's hard for them to swallow
# When you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds follow
# Pay yourself first, that's one of my main mottos
# Picture Bill Gates on the block dodgin hollows
# I can't see it player that's beneath my vision
# I'm beyond focused, every decision is made with precision
# It seems like greed's the world religion
# But L want cake, save the crumbs for the pidgeons
# Black man, get the flies outcha eyes
# You can't cause where you born but you affect where you die
# Until that day, health and welfare, cheers
# And after my wake, the hood'll talk, man listen here
# He kept a mink and canaries in his ears
# Like the Enterprise rollin over stars for years
# Spit bars for years, kept hot cars for years
# The dice was loaded but he beat the odds for years, uh-huh!
# [Verse Three]
# To be or not to be the man, that's the question
# Got a vision in my mind, I can see that I'm destined
# To lean up in the backseat, givin directions
# Sweep the block clean as November elections
# On the Blackberry readin cash flow quadrant
# Brim to the side, my gorillas is bonded
# CLS Vision, four Hummers behind it
# You forgot I'm from Queens? You can get reminded
# I'm a man's man, when you chumps gon' learn
# If you play with fire you get poured in a urn
# You must have been puffin on blunts of sherm
# All my albums is platinum, it's been confirmed
# I'm more than a symbol of sex, I get respect
# For livin in the hills but still keepin it mad real
# Stay on course, the boss crush obstacles
# You burnin me, two words: im-possible

# Like I said
# Yellow canary tennis on the neck

# We just gon have some fun with hip hop
# A lil hip hop... relax, hold on to ya seats
# Oh yeah this is the total banger too
# Word up, total banger baby
# Hip-Hop style baby, y'all remember
# By the middle of March, when the pregnancy starts
# In your ladies' placenta, that means L just entered
# Duck taped your little bitch ass for frontin
# You poor little crackhead ass ain't hurtin nuttin
# Nigga you want the fame, now you're famous overnight
# Famous for getting fucked by a stick of dynamite
# You're weak nigga, you bout to die up in your sleep
# The overlord of rap will never meet defeat
# Pain and agony, I don't touch them zones
# Fucking everlasting lyrical methods is my throne
# Blast ya fifty pound ass and make you float
# You read each script nigga, I wrote the book, nigga
# Held down my crown for a decade and a half
# Now I'm bout to give your grimy ass a blood bath
# Talk about bein broke, nigga I'm rich
# Cause I learned, to seperated the money from the bitch
# Don't hate me cause I'm paid, hate me because
# I'm everything you want to be : handsome, young, plus legendary
# Talk about Farrakhan, nigga you got to call Jesse Jackson
# For some Affirmative Action
# Chorus: repeat 4X
# Can-I-Bus !  Yes you can!
# Don't ever open your mouth and mention my steez
# Talk about my book you bought to read
# You know you watch the sitcom nigga so stop that
# Mad rapper, but now you turned mad actor
# Forty-nine pounds and tryin to be a monster
# Run around town with the Bob Marley imposters
# Ask Canibus, he ain't understandin this
# Cause ninety-nine percent of his fans, don't exist
# I'm goin underground and blowin your rep down
# Next time, save that shit for the Lyricist's Lounge
# Or a House Party, where you can battle some clown
# On top of all that, I beat your homeless ass down
# Heard that convicted rapist on the record too
# Fresh out of jail, ass cheeks still black and blue
# Tell me bout the things ear biter taught you
# How to bust a nut or two ?  (Yeah that's butta boo)
# You be decomposin, but you frozen because my title's stolen
# Steady rollin in a world that I'm controllin
# Vanguard awards are for Kings who get OFF!
# Clock platinum mountains, the praise of the Lord
# Talkin bout my first and second and third born
# Now I got a fourth, Canibus, but he cut off
# From the riches of my empire, I'm like a pimp
# Who thought he had to retire but found a new Canibus to hire
# You're hardcore, innocence like Heather Hunter
# But definitely not with the lyrics that drop thunder
# Now you in a trash can, hot black, cause you scared to bust
# Nigga it caused you rust
# Chorus
# Now break it down for me !
# See I, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, amateur, M,C's
# in hip-hop, word up, no bullshit
# Oh I ain't done yet
# You soft as a newborn baby takin a nap
# Make my dick hard with that bitch ass track
# Where you at?  Smokin in some one room flat
# Suckin on Clef's dick hopin to come back
# Never that, nigga my styles is unlimited
# Yours is prohibited, caught that, attributed
# To not knowin ya limits and who you need to test
# When you step into the house of the Lord and get blessed
# Get on your knees, bow down to my degrees
# Young slacker, save that demo for Jack the Rapper
# You gargoyle, slash olive oil, pussycat
# I wrapped up in aluminum foil, ready to boil
# I'ma tear the skin off ya ass with ten knuckles
# Rhymes was weak, they made me chuckle like a name buckle
# You call em lyrics, nigga you need to stop
# You goin out --- ahh fuck it, you goin pop
# I feed you a poisonous verse so don't try it
# No more rhymin, you on a lyric fast diet
# Call the paramedic and tell them that he pathetic
# His lyrics ain't energetic you're sweet as a diabetic
# Career be over next year, yeah I said it
# Look over your shoulder nigga, where you headed
# MUTHAFUCKA, where's a rhyme when you need it?
# First rule of lyrical war, never repeat it
# You said that same bull shitted out the blue
# Lit the pipe, dropped the match, and sparked the wrong fuse
# That's true, yeah nigga I'm goin at you
# Stop facin, and you can be a role model too
# Diss my moms, who's the real Rap Don ?
# Who ruled for fifteen years and drops bombs ?
# Who's got solid gold Grammy's that say Todd ?
# LL, when you drop verses the nigga's wrong
# Faggot, you better battle number two
# Cause number one, got his title locked down son
# The King of all rappers that ever graced the stage
# or the mic, best that ever did it I'm wicked
# Write a verse and flip it, melt it down to liquid
# And drown shorty, fill his lungs until I rip it
# Chest busts open, heart bursts and smokin
# YOU SEE THAT NIGGA SON?  (Damn L, we was only jokin)
# Maneuver manipulate brainwaves transform
# your thought process, when my pen gets erect
# Warning, all MC's better retreat
# Look at corny busta can't walk down his own street
# Better run and get the Fugees
# Cause I EAT, EAT, EAT, MC's
# Devour they titles, cause I'm an idol slash icon
# And tell Wyclef, don't even turn his fuckin mic on
# Sold ya nigga, thought I told ya nigga
# Crossover, slam dunk, game over nigga (one more time son)
# Sold ya nigga, thought I told ya nigga

$ The Hunger For More
# [Lloyd Banks]
# I know, I ain't supposed to smoke in here
# But Mr. Bouncer Man, don't put your motherfuckin hands on me
# (Can I get high) - without you botherin me
# Everybody you see in here tonight's
# doin the same thing, so why you keep player hatin on me?
# (Can I get high) - without you botherin me
# [50] Ay, did you hit this shit?
# [Chorus: G-Unit - repeat 2X]
# That la lah-lah, I be smokin
# Be gettin me right, I be loc'n
# Them bullshit trees, you be rollin
# barely gives you a buzz, me I get HIGH!
# [Lloyd Banks]
# I admit I got a problem, I keep comin back for these
# doe-doe bags, and not your 'gnac or your sack of seeds
# I chill, sit back on the sofa and relax my knees
# And roll one up loose enough to make the backwards breathe
# I blow a heavy load, you can subtract some G's
# cause I'm a smoker, too much of this to choke ya
# I don't mean to provoke ya, but I'm a bad influence
# A musician can't operate without his instruments
# My recent success rapidly got your bitch convinced
# Haters mad they can't look inside cause I pitched the tints
# I enter the club with baggies of that chocolate
# The secondhand smoke'll make a nigga wanna start shit
# Sometimes I think bout where the niggaz from the start went
# Raise up a lighter and fuck up the whole apartment
# It's just one of them things that I do with my spare time
# My bad habits ain't private, so I'ma share mine
# [Chorus]
# [Lloyd Banks]
# Now they put they hands out, cause of the way shit bend
# So you niggaz ain't smokin if you don't chip in
# Listen, I waited long for these rocks to glisten
# From that one-room pad without a pot to piss in
# Overt betrayal is not forgiven, I do this
# for my niggaz locked up that's comin home to lobster livin
# Helpin the cop's forbidden, bout to buy momma her own mansion
# Just so I can see her pop the ribbon
# That Cali bud special, so special I held the blunt so long
# Snoop had to tell me, "Pass the weed nephew!"
# Fuck rap, I'm the wrong one to get pissed off
# Cause the pump'll make you "Jump" like Kris Kross
# My nigga dead and it's hard to let go
# So I'm blowin on that wet doe, same color as Gecko
# We follow hood codes and everybody in the set know
# We gas 'em, fuck 'em and pass 'em, what you expect ho?
# [Chorus]
# [Snoop Dogg]
# Say 'gain won't you blow it with the best of them
# Yes yes I blessted them, blazed up the purple palm trees
# I told dem don't mess wit dem, I hold dem no testament
# Do you want to smoke wit me?
# Weed rollin, G-strollin, bad-mouthin muh'fucker
# Law breakin, pimp slappin niggaz for the fuck of it
# Hip-Hoppin, ziplockin, riprockin gangbanger
# "Thought you was an actor," thought I was a singer
# Thought about ridin if you say you wanna hang tough
# D.P.G. unit sounds like danger
# You might wanna manage your anger
# Hang with us and stop smokin on the same stuff
# Now lay back on the law
# This new weed that I got I call it face off
# Cause it'll blow your face off and that's a figure of speech
# My niggaz a beast, on me, from the West to the East, preach!
# [Chorus]
> Lloyd Banks
# [Verse - Lloyd Banks]
# I keep my hip on pound 'cause she gets hectic in my town
# Drag my family with me 'cause that's how real niggaz get down
# If it wasn't for 50 I probably wouldn't be around
# Caught up in the temptations, sitting in jail or underground
# And for that if you snap a finger I'll lay a nigga down
# Its fucked up when your only facial expression is a frown
# A hood rat a put a future in a fools pants
# Till she find out you cant buy furniture with food stamps
# A year ago I made a decision before I shut my eyelids
# Pray to God I get shot tomorrow 'cause I don't like surprises
# When you hot as a oven, they embrace you with open arms
# When you cold as a freezer, niggaz treat you like they don't need ya'
# Some people call it they vapors, me I call it amnesia
# Live my life principle driven, never bite the hand that feeds ya'
# Never mind all the haters, fuck them all, let them die slow
# All I need is my niggaz, money, liquor, and hydro
# I know!
# [Chorus - 2X]
# Everybody gon' die one day
# Whether its natural causes or gun play
# But fucking with me you sliding down a one way
# I keep it gangsta from Monday to Sunday
# [Verse - Lloyd Banks]
# Don't blame me, blame my mom and pop for breeding this
# The game needed this
# Lloyd Banks, a.k.a. Mr. I don't feed a bitch
# Or need a bitch, I state it when I meet a bitch
# If you wanna trick you need a switch
# 'Cause I don't trick Adidas bitch
# This is all I got, I have to blow
# So whether its fast or slow
# Platinum flow is making it easy to kidnap a hoe
# Pop the bag, pass the dro'
# Blow about a half a O
# Legit citizenship, my pimp is international
# You gotta agree, these motherfuckers a probably have me Latin
# Before they find a nigga hotter than me
# We on top as far as I can see
# And since the hood watching me
# My regular trip to the mall is a shopping spree
# I'm the number one draft pick, none of y'all topping me
# I move around with the plastic, you ain't dropping me
# The show me love in my city
# They fucking with me and I'm fucking with them
# Nigga G-Unit till the end
# [Chorus - 2X]
# [Bridge - Lloyd Banks]
# Your six inches from a coffin
# So I suggest you stop talking
# And make me resort to violence
# And You'll no longer be walking
# Your six inches from a coffin
# So I suggest you stop talking
# And make me resort to violence, nigga

# By any means I protect my charm
# Blade'll bubble you up, like Moet, Sean Don
# I'm only calm, when I'm blowin that chron'
# Gettin them flashbacks like baby hold onnnnn
# I never thought I'd sweat so long
# And re-enact the scene of my ghetto song
# Eyes wanderin off, breath all gone
# Stomach all swoll up, neck all warm
# Head still spinnin off that Seagram and vodka
# And you know who shot ya, bitch get the doctor!
# [Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
# (If you so gangsta)
# Then why you tuck your chain in when you walk in the club
# (And if you so gangsta)
# Why you a grown man, still gettin your pockets dug
# (If you so gangsta)
# Then how come everytime you get into beef you tell
# (And if you so gangsta)
# Why niggaz know you for that in the street so well
# [Lloyd Banks]
# Now every now and then, a new kid gotta win
# Yeah - but unfortunately for you, I'm him (I'm sorry!)
# In my new tan trucks with the blue dot end
# Hoppin out that big truck with the new wide rim
# While you cramped up, on your Jet Blue ride in
# We air the G-4, let the crew dive in
# Before Lloyd Banks tail pop on sale
# I feed a nigga a shell like Taco Bell
# I'm flyin out to Japan to attract new fans
# Let 'em get to know the man with the tattooed fans
# Them gem stars'll leave your face all fat
# So learn to stash yours in your baseball cap
# I'm either gettin money out of state or off rap
# So I'm tryin to figure out what made Ma$e fall back
# And them niggaz in New York know the man is a monster
# And I ain't from Atlanta but I A-Town stomp ya muh'fucker
# [Lloyd Banks]
# It's like everywhere I look and, everywhere I go
# It's a bitch sayin somethin slick, but you can suck my dick
# I'm grade A nigga, you don't know who you fuckin with
# They run up on your ass, you'll think you drunk your lip
# Now I got money bags as big as a pumpkin get
# And pistol as long as the hand Shaq dunkin with
# I ain't the type that's desperate
# I'm modelin diamonds now, you can call me +Icin+ Beckford (ow!)
# My down bitch holds the metal, she got a Coke bottle figure
# And a ass that's shaped like a bowl of Jell-o
# You ain't even almost rich
# They fuckin yo' ass, like the models in my porno flicks
# Therefore you can't afford no 6
# So before you hop your ass on camera get your wardrobe fixed
# Banks don't house, want no bitch, so if there's five of her
# Then she probably gon' suck 4 more dicks

# [Intro - Lloyd Banks]
# Yeah!
# Aye yo 50
# They don't do it like us nigga
# Yeah!
# I'm so fly, I got money
# So that's good enough reason to buy the things I buy
# I'm so high, I'm on point
# And I could tell that your jealous just by the look in your eye
# And when I ride by
# I don't care, G-Unit's going straight to the top this year
# Nigga I'm so fly, I got money
# So that's good enough reason to buy the things I buy
# [Verse - Lloyd Banks]
# Uh, Banks is fresh out the gutter
# Too smooth to stutter
# The cig a melt a brother like two scoops of butter
# Before I leave the crib I tell my mother I love her
# Grab the burner
# But she ain't concerned 'cause he's a earner
# My bitch lays it out real nice for me to murder
# We fight, wake up and fuck like Ike and Tina Turner
# Its a privilege to ride with a celeb'
# 'Cause them girls over here don't got a problem giving head
# Paranoia is on ya', that's why ya' llama's in ya' bed
# Fuck some real Chinchilla, buy some Llama for ya' head
# Where the block I'm from
# Niggaz be damn near forty and still tucking
# And niggaz baby mama's is pregnant and still fucking
# It's either 'cause they boyfriends a scrub like Brillo
# 'Cause Banks is cooler than the other side of the pillow
# The chronic is blown
# For my niggaz that got locked up and deported
# And now they gotta go back home
# [Verse - Lloyd Banks]
# Don't confuse me with the suckers
# 'Cause when I spit, You'll hear more â€œOh'sâ€?
# Then a Skip-to my-Lou move at the Rucker
# Thank God for giving Banks the gift
# You think that bandana makes you look gangsta
# But all I see is a handkerchief
# Nigga there's no one out the click that freezes
# Believe that, 'cause I ain't scared a shit but Jesus
# Look dog, I don't run with the poodles
# Difference is, I'm eating in Rome and you eating Roman Noodles
# Ya' boy is corrupt kid
# Banks a send a bitch to the store
# Just for a piece of cheesecake like Puff did
# You chumps cant afford these homes
# Look around I got forty clones
# Now look down, that's forty stones
# And that's only in the necklace
# I'm bony and I'm wreck lace
# It's Tony in a Lexus
# I'm fresh out the gutter, scrap what ya' man thought
# I'm in the hood with more straps than a Jan sport
# [Verse - Lloyd Banks]
# When I travel I know I'm gon' get stuck
# 'Cause they harass us in the airport
# Like I'm the one that's blowing shit up
# I got the patience of a High School teacher
# And a bright future
# Why the fuck would I have a bum on my sneaker?
# All the goodie girls back off us
# My hearts colder then Jack Frost's
# We pack shows and attract bosses
# Black clothes with my black Forces
# A black rose for a rats coffin
# I'm blowing O's of that black coughing
# Blow on the road then I'm back flossing
# No one knows how much that's costing
# Fuck ass, only the green moves me
# I got a clean Uzi
# A pair of gloves and a mask from the Scream movie
# So if you plotting on popping off, then scheme smoothly
# Or get a little red splatter on ya' cream Coogi
# My name ring each state
# So you ain't gotta go all the way to L.A. to get ya MC ate

# Even the chips are low, for all these so-called old heads
# Just ain't the same niggaz I used to know
# I got a Houston ho - nah she ain't the sharpest knife
# in the drawer but she a damn good booster though
# See I could fuck a supermodel with my {?} works
# Send her home with a smile and a couple kids on her shirt
# I got a year into the game
# A 141 rocks layin on my chain, geah!
# [Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
# Just another day, chillin in the hood

# So break your lil' weed up and crack your cigars down
# Cause I ain't tryin to start my visits, with the fuckin judge
# givin niggaz life like it's parkin tickets
# Now I get to go to bed with a model
# And the crib is bout as big as it is on the Belvedere bottle

# Pushed me off everytime I tried
# But I'm alright
# I'm able to swallow my pride
# And put all the bullshit to the side
# If you ready to ride
# Im down for a one night stand
# I'll accept it any way that I can
# Cuz I aint yo man
# I'll try for whatever its worth
# Just remember who played who first
# [Lloyd Banks]
# I cant keep my eyes off ya
# I can tell why them other guys lost ya
# Your kinds rarer than a flying saucer
# And that's what I can offer
# Similarities and characters
# Havnt ya heard the word around town
# How I get down?
# They all whistle
# Everybody part official
# And that ass was you
# Got my dick hard as a missle
# Dont hop on top
# Cuz I ride around with a pistle
# N if they pull us over ill be out of town wit an issue
# If you was mine id introduce you to momma girl
# You're stylin' your boots and Gabana
# Im so used to ur prada
# Taking trips to houston its hotta
# Throwing that Al Green n using that impala
# Lay my jewels on my collar
# Ya had me feeling like a fool when I holla'd
# Trying to squeeze in but you wouldnt bother
# But I aint either
# Soon as I realize that I ain't need her
# She in a rush to get close to me but I aint eager
# [Chorus]
# [Lloyd Banks]
# Like I dont mean to bother you
# But your sex appeal is remarkable
# U make a G wanna walk around in a park with you
# There aint no telling what kinda things that I'm'a start to do
# If I get wrapped up on your ass to fast
# I can tell you feel the same cuz when I ask you laugh
# So I'm'a leave it at that n hint n put it in my math
# I imagine your prolly twice as good in a bath
# But I'm buggin
# Cuz I can see you right in the hood when I pass
# I'm never stabled cuz business is on my ass
# But you can be the one I visit before I dash
# An I admit I been the type to hit n split
# But you can't blame me for the females that I been getting with
# Cuz
# Most of these broads have there eyes on my grits
# Till they're in deeper shit n they learn how to be satisfied with the dick an'
# N if you aint worth it then thats all you get
# I aint gonna blame you I'm gonna blame all you tricks
# Cuz

# U seem like your attitude
# Only appears when I'm mad at you
# When several situations occur and that includes
# When I'm gone to long ridin' thru them avenues
# As soon as I get home this room is a scattered boos
# U know my fantasies and my feeling things at camera speed
# N ur girlfriends trying to sandwich me
# My hearts colder then ya sandwich meat
# Cuz I come from the hood where the hammers be
# I move fast but at a switch pace
# N I pop in a listerine strip before you get all up on a bitch face
# Moving your body like this
# Gonna make me blow like a bottle of cris
# I dont know noone hotter then twis
# You got my temperature risin' from your hips to ur thighs an
# That glare in your eyes that brighten up her horizon
# It comes naturally I dont bribe em
# It's easy as... 1, 2, 3 and I slide in

# [Verse 1]
# When I was ten years old, I seen a nigga take three in the head
# Probably around the same time he used to pee in the bed
# I stayed awake, cause my nightmares was seein' 'em dead
# Smelled the burnt tires peelin' after leavin' him lead
# The killer fled, with a fuckin' laugh
# My heart pumpin' on blast
# I just started at him, slumped in the grass
# Arms movin', fingers shakin', spittin' up blood
# DNA mixed in the mud, another ditch to be dug
# There I stood, stiffer than wood
# See homey used to buy me candy
# Now he's gone, who gone provide his family?
# My earring, shoulda been runnin'
# I never thought I'd be that sick
# Damn, I wasn't 'posed to see that shit
# That's when I thought
# It was more than three shots
# He coulda been waitin for me, maybe he circled around the block
# I turned around at my pops, he like "what happened?"
# This nigga rolled up and just started clappin'
# I can still hear him laughin'
# [Verse 2]
# It was a regular day in South Side, sprinklers and kids runnin'
# All of a sudden, head's turnin', somebody did somethin'
# This nigga named, I forgot, fuck it, he lived around the block
# Regular gettin' money nigga, but loved to clown a lot
# Walked across the park, stuntin', frontin'
# Diamonds in his ear, diamond watch on
# Eatin' a bag of popcorn
# Walked up behind a shorty, grabbin' her waist
# She pushed him away, so he threw the bag in her face
# She felt disrespected, shorty couldn't accept it
# Called him a pussy, told him she'd be back in a second
# But he din't pay her no mind
# Called her a bitch about four times
# Stayed in the park, wit' no niggaz wit' em and no nine
# And them in no time, older nigga from behind
# Swung a baseball bat, left his face all crack
# Told him "take all that"
# Hit him again, popped his chain wit' a frown
# And left the clown, with a stain on the ground
# [Verse 3]
# All my days go by blowin' that sticky, icky
# California made me picky
# Chicken head tried to stick me wit' a hickey
# If we, blow up quickly, stickly, somewhere tipsy
# The location don't matter, I'm South Side until' they hit me
# I'll be DEAD
# If looks can kill, I'm from the ghetto boys
# But I don't know Scarface, I push wit' bill

# Runnin circles with the competition on the court
# He appreciates your support but he aint beggin for it

# It's the second time this week
# It ain't easy, but bless your heart for trying
# I can tell that you've been losing sleep
# *Give me on minute of your darkest hour
# And I'll turn it into something real
# Gonna make you shine
# No matter how long, I'm gonna take my time
# I'll make you shine
# Whatever it takes, I'm gonna make you mine
# I'll make you shine
# I've seen you hanging out with your friends in the parking lot
# Afraid to show them how you feel
# I see you smilin like you're happy
# But I know you're not
# It's gonna take some time to heal
# I know it seems impossible to move along, to be strong
# So let me be the one who understands,
# I understand~

# You tell me you love me
# And you'll never leave me
# I want to believe love is true
# Cause if one day I woke up
# And found out we broke up
# No one can take the place
# If there was you
# (Chorus)
# I could never fall in love again
# Never the way that I could pretend
# Now that I've had the best
# I touched forever but it never could be
# Better than this
# How could my heart forget?
# I'll never be the same
# And baby, your love's to blame
# How could I settle for less
# Now that I've had the best
# As soon as I read
# That in your arms that I've give my love
# To love you is what I'm waiting for
# To love me so deeply
# So strong and strong feeling
# There's no one who could love you more
# (Chorus)
# I could never fall in love again
# Never the way that I could pretend
# Now that I've had the best

# How could my heart forget?
# I'll never be the same
# And baby, your love's to blame

# Now the seats are all empty
# Let the loadies take to stage
# Pack it up and tear it down
# They're the first to come and last to leave
# Working for that minimum wage
# They'll set it up in another town
# Tonight the people were so fine
# They waited there in line
# And when they got up on their feet they made the show
# And that was sweet
# But I can hear the sound
# Of slamming doors and folding chairs
# And that's sound they'll never know
# Now roll them cases out and lift them amps
# Haul them trusses down and get'em up them ramps
# 'Cause when it comes to moving me
# You know you guys are the champs
# But when that last guitar's been packed away
# You know that I still want to play
# So just make sure you got it all set to go
# Before you come for my piano
# But the bands on the bus
# And they're waiting to go
# We've got to drive all night and do the show in Chicago
# Or Detroit, I don't know
# We do so many shows in a row
# And these towns all look the same
# We just pass the time in the hotel rooms
# And wander round backstage
# 'Till those lights come up and we hear that crowd
# And we remember why we came
# Now we got country and western on the bus
# R & B, we got disco in eight tracks and cassettes in stereo
# We got time to think of the ones we love
# While the miles roll away
# But the only time that seems too short
# Is the time that we get to play
# People you've got the power over what we do
# You can sit there and wait
# Or you can pull us through
# Come along, sing the song
# You know you can't go wrong
# 'Cause when that morning sun comes beating down
# You're goning to wake up in your town
# But we'll be scheduled to appear
# A thousand miles away from here
# People stay just a little bit longer
# We want to play just a little bit longer
# Now the promoter don't mind
# And the union don't mind
# If we take a little time
# And we leave it all behind and sing
# One more song

# Lying there beside me
# With your head resting on my arm

# And your hair smells
# Like a Sunday morning
# I feel you moving closer
# And I know what you're gonna say
# But girl there's just no way
# I'll ever like what you'll be saying
# Don't tell me goodnight
# It makes me feel so empty inside
# And if only I could
# I wouldn't sleep at all
# Don't tell me goodnight
# Just let me drift off slowly away
# And dream of you
# You reach out and you touch me
# Just to let me know you're there
# And I can feel your hair

# She knows when I'm lonesome, she cries when I'm sad
# She's up in the good times, she's down in the bad
# Whenever I'm discouraged, she knows just what to do
# But girl she doesn't know about you.
# I can tell her my troubles, she makes them all seem right
# I can make up excuses not to hold her at night
# We can talk of tomorrow, I'll tell her things that I want to do
# But girl how can I tell her about you.
# How can I tell her about you
# Girl please tell me what to do
# Everything seems right whenever I'm with you
# So girl won't you tell me how to tell her about you.
# How can I tell her I don't miss her whenever I'm away
# How can I say it's you I think of every single night and day
# But when is it easy telling someone we're through
# Ah girl help me tell her about you.

# I remember to this day
# The bright red Georgia clay
# And how it stuck to the tires
# After the summer rain
# Will power made that old car go
# A woman's mind told me that so
# Oh how I wish
# We were back on the road again
# Me and you and a dog named boo
# Travelin' and livin' off the land
# Me and you and a dog named boo
# How I love being a free man
# I can still recall
# The wheat fields of St. Paul
# And the morning we got caught
# Robbing from an old hen
# Old McDonald he made us work
# But then he paid us for what it was worth
# Another tank of gas
# And back on the road again
# I'll never forget the day
# We motored stately into big L.A.
# The lights of the city put settlin'
# Down in my brain
# Though it's only been a month or so
# That old car's buggin' us to go
# We've gotta get away and get back on
# The road again

# I've known her since we both were kids,
# I recall the silly things we did
# She would want to ride up on my back
# To keep from stepping on a crack
# I didn't think of it back then
# But even when she did not win
# She was happy just to play
# Stoney likes to live out everyday
# Stoney, happy all the time
# Stoney, live is summertime
# The joy you find in living everyday
# Stoney, how I love your simple ways
# The times when no one understood
# Seems that stoney always would
# We walk for hours in the sand
# She would always try and hold my hand
# Now I don't recollect the time
# I fell in love with this old friend of mine
# Or when I first saw in her eyes
# What she tried so not to hide.

# Res čudno je na svetu, verjeli ali ne, da tisti ki nič nima, rad dal ljudem bi vse, če tudi le veselje, okoli bi delil, pa na skrivaj bi včasih, pred drugim solze skril. A v srcu pa je srečen, in vedno nasmejan, kot ptiček je svoboden, mu kratek je vsak dan, na licih pa brezskrbnih, dobrota mu žari, še zadnji košček kruha, si z drugim razdeli.
# Črnih las, skuštrvih, kolovrati potepuh, dolgih hlač strgani, spodaj bos, v žepih suh, nič ne ve kdaj je dan, spi takrat ko je zaspan, in tako mine mu vsak dan.
# Če srečas potepuha, ki lačen je in bos, ne glej ga kot lenuha, odreži kruha kos, lahko se ti v življenju, še marsikaj zgodi, hrbet obrne sreča, in poteuh boš ti.
# Črnih las, skuštrvih, kolovrati potepuh, dolgih hlač strgani, spodaj bos, v žepih suh, nič ne ve kdaj je dan, spi takrat ko je zaspan, in tako mine mu vsak dan.

Na oknu hišice, slonelo je dekle, ko sem prišel do tja, se je nasmehnila, ne bom odtrgal je, te žlahtne rožice, zaklenil v svoje, jo bom srce...

# Turn to the six o'clock news, another soldier dies
# Tried to hide it but I couldn't help it, I had to cry
# When my little boy asked me daddy was he your friend
# I said no, I didn't even know him
# But he was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
# A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
# He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
# And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
# He was somebody's someone
# So I sat there in that chair and helped him understand
# How this brave young man gave his life for our land
# And although he's someone we'll never know
# To you and me he is a hero
# He was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
# A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
# He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
# And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
# He was somebody's someone
# To the world he was a total stranger
# Who kept us safe and out of danger
# But now he's just a picture on TV
# Somebody's memory
# He was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
# A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
# He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
# And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
# He was somebody's someone
# He was somebody's someone

# I like your look in that sweater

# I see you in a bikini
# One lazy toe in the pool
# Layed back and sippin' on something long, tall and cool
# Yeah, I can't wait for a warm breeze blowin'
# Green grass growin' and the bright sunshine
# Short sundress with your long legs showin'
# I can't wait for the summertime
# Oh the summertime

# To a tropical isle

# We'll take our drinks with umbrellas
# We'll take a room with a view
# I'm gonna take my sweet time makin' love to you
# That's what I'm gonna do

# So you say your love´s about to end
# You say you can´t take no more
# She´s out the door
# And your looking for a friend
# Who am I to tell you why
# But I´m just curious, were you furious
# Or did you swallow your pride
# And look her in the eye and
# Tell her that you love her
# Tell her that you need her
# Tell her that you want her to stay
# Reassure her with a kiss
# She may never know unless you
# Show her what your feeling
# Tell her you´re believing
# Even though it´s hard to say
# ´Cause she needs to know you´re thinking of her
# So open up and tell her that you love her
# Brother I´ve been right where you are now
# And my heart was broke
# ´Cause I never spoke
# Those healing words out loud
# But I´ve learned my lesson well
# And now every night
# Before I close my eyes
# I look at my woman and
# I ask myself did you
# Tell her that you love her
# Tell her that you need her
# Tell her that you want her to stay
# Reassure her with a kiss
# She may never know unless you
# Show her what your feeling
# Tell her you´re believing
# Even though it´s hard to say
# ´Cause she needs to know you´re thinking of her
# So open up and tell her that you love her
# Tell her that you love her
# Tell her that you love her
# Tell her that you need her
# Tell her that you want her to stay
# Reassure her with a kiss

# It's the way you twist a curl into your hair
# As you sit there unaware of how beautiful you are
# It's the music that I always seem to hear
# When you bring yourself to tears from laughing way too hard
# And when we're slowly dancing and you slip off your shoes
# Don't you know, baby, just like everything you do
# That gets me, that just gets me every time
# Right here inside this heart of mine
# You open up your world and lay your love out on the line
# That gets me, that just gets me every time
# It's the way you say your prayers before you sleep
# Then you curl up next to me and we hold each other close
# And you tell me with your eyes that you'll never let me go
# And that may be the moment that I love the most
# When you make me feel like no other man exists
# And when I taste the power and surrender of your kiss
# That gets me, that just gets me every time
# Right here inside this heart of mine
# You open up your world and lay your love out on the line
# That gets me, that just gets me every time
# Right here inside this heart of mine
# You open up your world and lay your love out on the line
# That gets me, that just gets me every time
# Oh that gets me, that just gets me every time
# That gets me
# It's the way you twist a curl into your hair
# As you sit there unaware of how beautiful you are
# It's the way you say your prayers before you sleep
# Then you curl up next to me oh that gets me
# That gets me

# I hear the sound of gentle rain
# Like teardrops on the windowpane
# A priceless smile in a wooden frame beside the bed
# I stare at the ceiling and talk to the walls
# I lay here alone and imagine it all
# As a river of memories rush through my head
# I can almost taste your kiss as I think about how much I miss
# Your hungry eyes, your satin skin
# The sound of your voice whisperin'
# The love I feel inside your heart
# When you're wrapped up in my arms so close
# That's what I miss the most
# I try to rest but sleep won't come
# My body aches and my mind is numb
# Shadows fall as the morning sun begins to rise
# Another day without you here
# Has it been weeks or has it been years
# I find it getting harder to keep track of time
# I breath in and I breath out but it's getting tough to live without
# Your hungry eyes, your satin skin
# The sound of your voice whisperin'
# The love I feel inside your heart
# When you're wrapped up in my arms so close
# That's what I miss the most
# What I miss the most
# I can almost taste your kiss as I think about how much I miss
# Your hungry eyes, your satin skin
# The sound of your voice whisperin'
# The love I feel inside your heart
# When you're wrapped up in my arms so close

# I guess just about everything I've ever done
# I've been tryin' to impress or get close to one of 'em
# Seems like I was about thirteen
# Bobbi Jo Guthrie was the pumpkin queen
# That night I realized for the very first time
# Women rule the world
# The way they talk, the way they giggle
# The way they walk, the way they jiggle
# Makes men buy 'em diamonds and pearls
# That look when they're up to something
# Soft touch, oh that lovin'
# They're sexy when they're mamas
# Cute when they're girls
# Women rule the world
# We men like to think we're in control
# We all want to be big shots
# We like to think we run the show
# The truth is with just the right smile
# You ladies know you can drive us wild
# Those mini-skirts and the way you flirt
# You know just what works
# Women rule the world
# The way they talk, the way they giggle
# The way they walk, the way they jiggle
# Makes men buy 'em diamonds and pearls
# That look when they're up to something
# Soft touch, oh that lovin'
# They're sexy when they're mamas
# Cute when they're girls
# Women rule the world
# In all shapes and sizes
# They make my temperature rise
# Style and brains, the whole shebang
# I'm here to say, women rule the world
# That look when they're up to something
# Soft touch, oh that lovin'
# They're sexy when they're mamas
# Cute when they're girls
# Women rule the world
# Women rule the world
# Women rule the world

# Since you got it like that baby doll I got it good
# Hook me up one time and make it feel real good
# If you make me feel nice not once maybe twice
# Dim the lights one time breakout the Alize on ice
# That's right
# Yeah you got it good baby
# We can hook up anywhere anytime or day
# Most brotha's try to think of dope lines to say
# We treat women with respect like a real lady
# Now when I lounge around the way I be like asking all of my crew
# Is sort of like playin basketball
# Hey man do you
# crush the jim hat on before I slam dunk to get humped
# Best chill before that girl gets spunked
# The say you got wild style while giving that girl erection
# Wildchild's up in your face always promoting protection
# I got this relation wit this girl in my section
# Word is bond
# Yeah she's my way out so I seek no infection
# Gold digger higgers playing like miss dÃ©jÃ  vu
# Running round talking bout you use to stay by who
# Causing problems but my problem solver is more like a revolver
# Lyrically lounge mode
# Is like chillin wit my boo
# I'm blew wit two hits
# Then pass and stay true
# Rolling out wit my crew
# Back stabbing benefits never hit my way cause I always parlay
# Tell the brothers to bust protection in any selection

# Only had one selection
# Plant my seed and live life with out trife and deceptions
# Living out the Cali wild brothers running mad game
# Some people flock cause they are all on that fame
# But I don't pay it no mind
# Get in that gossip
# You want to floss it
# Head trips is gonna process hectic
# Female brains sustain like hexes
# Genetics who said it cause I'm like in it to win it
# We keep it real while brothers try to interpertate lyrical skills
# Ninety six get use to a condiment that miracle pill
# Those that are not one hundred percent effective my main objective
# Is to push forth knowledge in the youth so they stay mad protected
# Don't prove me wrong
# Unprotection is really not good for your health
# The reason you get caught
# what you do is cause you carry yourself
# Quite unwisely not thinking about your outcome

# Brotha's taking care of ya
# We gonna hittin off like this
# Declaime hittin off like this
# I'm sharp wit it shatter sharp tongue simple minded snake type nigga
# Since I ascend up and above the law
# My swarm is the flouriest when I descend all the way through the under lands
# Excavating couldn't trace it
# Selling everyday defacing whack on the way
# 9021 hoe's are not needed
# Challengers all get seeded
# When I enter this arena made for lyrical attack
# Just made a style sword made of facts
# Death to the one who lax and know how to attract
# Hard earned respect
# I shall keep all who oppose
# I will keep killin shaq
# Dee hittin off wit that ill minded rap like this
# I stands clear out the way of the industry's phonies
# If the let me peep
# Just walk if they show me
# I bring a cease to a bad situation
# Beyond belief I'm here to teach
# Lessons to the weak
# Not talking finer arts but higher arts
# I must run laps
# At my peak my apex allows me to seek
# All who envy's me
# If ya blind I'll make ya see my point of view
# For the few of you thought that they could get through
# Declaime's here to teach you
# Not how to west a rhyme
# With space age lines
# Or complicated rhymes cause I want y'all to see
# When I coming
# So you know that I ain't running away
# Trying to seek a safe shelter from this lyrical attack
# Never will get whack
# Skills I never lack
# Lets all gather and have a laugh at the ones in the past that fell off
# Getting ass
# Lets have a laugh with the real that set the standards and showed all the deal
# Every rapper has his mothers clear only a few have a year
# Speak ably unique I'm in my own atmosphere
# Uplift to get the rhyme with no rehearsal
# I hurt those
# Ones with the no flow
# D day is here again you better tell a friend
# Wit my eyes closed I still can defend
# My position unmovable because of irrigation
# I do it with the mic and no tek
# Until you fall back

# This is an SCG3 special report with Sam Romero.
# Sam Romero:
# "Good evening, Im Sam Romero. We continue our special report now on the so called monster invasion. As of 11 AM today the president has declared the nation to be under martial law. Reports coming in now indicate that mass hysteria continues to spread throughout the globe. It is not yet confirmed by officials what is causing these horrific events. But it is suggested by certain sources that these creatures that are now being spotted throughout the world are neither human, nor are they wild animals. It is strongly advised that people should stay indoors and if you encounter one of these beings do not try to make contact with them. They will attack without warning. Our very own William Tracey in the sky is now reporting. Will?"
# William Tracey:
# "Sam, were here hovering over down town where the monsters are literally swarming the city. The freeways are clogged, there is absolutely no way out of downtown. These creatures, they're incredibly strong. A few minutes ago we saw one actually pick up an SUV, and throw it at a clump of people. And then... Eh, zoom in on that, yeah, are we getting that? Its actually looking at us! Its, its climbing! Its, no, pull up! Pull up!! Pull up"
# Sam Romero:
# "Will? Hmm erm, we seem to be suffering from technical difficulties. We'll get back to William Tracey as soon as we get the satellite feed repaired. In the mean time we now go live to Joan Carr at the Hellbender Plaza Joan?"
# Joan Carr:
# "Sam, Im standing here with thousands of citizens. The first thing that greeted us when we drove up was the smell of decomposing flesh. The dead are literally walking the streets. Even though the people know about the curfew there is absolutely no trace of the police or the military yet. Its understandable that the people feel the urge to get out of their homes and go look for their loved ones they dont know what to do and how to cope with this. Uh, somethings happening. Erm. Oh my god! Run!! Drop the camera! Drop the camera! Run!! (screams)"
# Sam Romero:
# "Uh. We, erm, seem to be experiencing some more technical difficulties with Joan as well so... Hmm. I am just being told that someone is infiltrating our broadcast.. Are are we going off the air?"
# Spoken by Dee Snider:
# "Good evening you puny little humans. Dont try to adjust your sets, we control the transmission. Your dominion of the Earth has gone on far too long. You've had your chances, you've blown them all. Now its time to cut the bullshit! You are a plague, we're forced to take disciplinary action. Behold the sounds that will grind your insides, the sights that will make you blind. Your walls of iron will bend and the seas will run red with your blood. The earth will quake and open its fuming maw swallowing all the heretics and fools on the wide path to hell. The skies will open with a thunderous raw! My little pets will fly out in swarms that will block the sun. They will kiss the flesh off the bones of those who still choose to follow the false prophets. Join us or forever drown in the pit of despair. The Scartic Circle Gathering is now. This is the day of reckoning. This is The Arockalypse!"

# Were we pulled out way too soon?
# Were we quiet too long? Were we too small?
# Or were we dropped on the floor?
# Could it be something we ate?
# Did they let us stay up too late?
# Were there not enough rules?
# Did we get too much love?
# Was it something they taught us in school?
# 'Cause inside something bad's awakened
# The evil opens it's eyes
# The temper's rising and the house is shaking
# To get out is no longer an option
# These are the deeds of the beast

# We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
# (Woah-woah!)
# See us, pretty brides, and the evil we wed
# Oh Lord, we play with the dead
# Was it something we saw on TV?
# The films that were gross and obscene?
# Is it the clothes and the black-dyed hair,
# Or were we just not aware
# The must have been some dangerous toys
# And the music sings of murderous ploys
# It�s not like we did not have a choice
# Backward masking gives the devil a voice
# Now we wanna play with the dead

# Would you love a monsterman
# Could you understand beauty of the beast
# Fire at will - yeah I would kill
# Yeah I would freeze all hell over just to get a chill
# Yeah I would slay - Yeah I would maim
# Yeah I would in thin air and reappear again
# Be right in the squares, yeah I would be sincere
# Yeah I would lie, Yeah I would lie
# Yeah I would be there waking up the dead to get a thrill
# I say yeah - I say yeah
# Would you love a monsterman
# Could you understand beauty of beast
# I would do it all for you, would you do it all
# Do it all for me
# Take your time - you'll be fine
# Yeah there is nothing wrong with this
# you ain't committing crime
# You don't know why we passed you by
# You search for something never found
# Along these lines
# Someday you may turn aruond and terrify
# You can't deny - You crucify
# Would you get down in the gutter
# Swallowing your pride
# I say yeah - I say yeah
# Would you love a monsterman
# Could you understand beauty of beast
# I would do it all for you, would you do it all
# Do it all for me
# All that you get is much less
# you deserve
# Leaving for now
# Someday I may return

# There I was laying down smoking grass
# Feeling sexy in the sun
# Just sunning my buns in the sun
# Just doing it
# Playing with myself
# Out in the sun
# I was pretty far out
# As I started to shout
# When a dildo from Mars
# Swinging from a cloud
# Came rushing down
# Landing the ground
# I was freaking out
# Out in space they're a sexy race
# But aliens are not my piece of cake
# Android  have little dicks
# Martians don't give me the kicks
# There's just no kick
# With a little dick
# They were rotten little mean
# Horny sex machines
# In their dildo ship
# That looked really hip
# And cool
# But I'm no fool
# They showed their tools

# I set sail like the holy grail the crusader don't cater to no shit that's frail
# Take me to the catacomb on the dragon's chrome
# After dark I leave my mark like it's etched in stone
# I'm pure white heat I take a quantum leap
# I'm coming deep in the night like a nightmare in your sleep
# Like a Viking funeral I'm leaving shit burned
# I said clowns get drowned when the tide gets turned
# We're the Lordz we sport the crowns we're the kings underground
# What comes around goes around and it brings you right down
# [Verse Three]
# I'm on a sixth probation or should I say vacation
# Vickin' motherfuckers when they're steppin' in my station
# Stalkin' through the tunnel with a shank in my hand
# Penetrate that fuckin' lung let it flow like a dam
# Something's up with Kaves something's up with Kaves
# Yo you gotta get made made
# Yo you gotta get paid paid
# I'm the king of enamel the crazy ducky boy wearing flannel
# I climb the Verrazano eat my pasta with Romano
# The Brooklyn mutt is about to go rabid
# Killin' motherfuckers is my only bad habit
# Punks jump up and I'm doin' 'em
# My Louisville broke so I switched to aluminum
# Yo lemme tell you somethin' about the Verrazano Boys
# We made a lot of noise beatin' up them toys
# If you stepped to the crew or even walked on the fame
# You know you got stomped by a big ink stain
# 1995 we're called Lordz of Brooklyn
# Step on the turf and your wallet's gettin' tookin'
# Vamped thrown to the curb had a lotta nerve to steppin' on my turf
# Now you're gettin' whacked! Pow! Whacked with a bat
# Now you're suckin' on the dust from my black Cadillac
# Here I come big shots it's ADM

# Pass me the wine lemme throw it down
# You heard what's on my mind now check the sound

# Black Jack, Black Jack Mack the Knife is at the table
# Someone raised the anti and the Lordz switched the label
# Too many jokers with the poker face

# I paid my dues so the odds are in my favor
# And if you come out bluffin' I got three bullets in the chamber

# I ain't your bitch so why you try to slob me
# And take me out like your one night ho
# But now I get paid cause Rick says so

# It's good night Irene
# I got a dollar and a dream
# We're the Lordz from the county of the kings not the queens
# We saw it from the start we saw the deck marked
# I said I'm lost out at sea with some A&R sharks
# Like 52 pick-up we're up in the air
# But the Lordz are aware we're alone like solitaire
# Yo you think you're hard

# [Verse One: performed by ADMoney]
# Listen up here's a tale about a white kid
# That had to make some cash
# Dropped out of school ain't never went to class
# Sold a little grass, robbed a couple cars
# Had a name around the neighborhood for fightin' in the bars
# Had a chip on his shoulder
# He's a chip off the block
# When he drinks, he drinks alone
# Grabbed the whiskey took a swig
# Heard the fiddle didn't jig
# Cause he's watchin' everybody round him blowin' up gettin' big
# So he picks out a ride, slim jims the door
# Now he's runnin' red lights and beatin' stop signs
# Cops are on his ass and he's runnin' out of time
# So he hits the chop shop, makes drop, cause he's sick of bein' poor
# He's white trash and he's knockin' on your door
# [Pre Chorus]
# Somebody's knockin' at my door, somebody's ringin' my bell
# I'm white trash and I'm knockin' on your door
# White Trash and I'm knockin' on your door
# White Trash and I'm knockin' on your door
# I know you hear me knockin' so what you hidin' for
# [Verse Two: performed by ADMoney]
# He ain't never joined the, he ain't no altar boy
# He's an angel with a dirty face like Pretty Boy Floyd
# He's the kind a kid sittin' in the park if you wanna cop a lid
# And if he got popped he wouldn't rat he do the bid
# Cause he's tuff like rugby down right ugly
# If you owe him money you'll be black and blue and bloody
# From his tenement slum right down to the gutter
# He might run a number, sell some iron to the brothers
# Cause the cops beat him down and it doesn't make the news
# But to him that's payin' dues when you're walkin' in his shoes
# [Pre Chorus]
# [Verse Three: performed by ADMoney]
# It's just another night in the old gin mill
# He got a pocket of old dirty dollar bills
# He buys his boys a round, they toast it up, they shoot it down
# They're gettin' stared at by some off duty cops sittin' down
# So what you lookin' at you wanna catch a smack
# He finishes his beer and his boys take his back
# And they mix it up, they're brawlin' on the ground
# The cop pulls his pistol and fires off a round
# Yo he should of got a job, should of went to class
# Now he's layin' all alone, still poor white trash
# [Pre Chorus]

# In the sunlight of your smile
# In the summer of our life
# In the magic of love
# Storms above scattered away
# Lovers dreaming in the night
# Reaching for Paradise
# But as the dark shadows fade
# Love slips away
# On an empty stretch of beach
# In the pattern of the waves
# Drawing pictures with my hand
# In the sand, I see your face
# Skipping pebbles on the sea
# Wishing for Paradise
# Sand castles crumble below
# The restless tides ebb and flow
# Listening to a shell
# Hoping for your voice
# Beautiful Maria of my soul
# Though we'll always be apart
# Locked forever in a dream
# If I ever love again
# Even then, nothing will change
# And the taste of you remains
# Clinging to Paradise
# But as the distance from you grows
# All that my heart ever knows
# Hunger for your kiss
# Longing for your touch
# Beautiful Maria of my soul
# Filling all my nights
# Haunting all my days
# Beautiful Maria of my soul.

# Sábado a la noche sali a pasear.
# Con mis amigos fui al "Whisky Bar".
# Alli conocí a una chica, María.
# La recordare mientras viva.
# La cosa al principio funcionó muy bien,
# charlamos en la barra y luego fuimos a bailar.
# Ya de madrugada, en el cuarto del hotel,
# le di lo que quería lo que venia a buscar.
# No sabía lo que me esperaba.
# No sabía lo que me esperaba.
# No sabía que la llamaban.
# Peligrosa María
# Peligrosa María
# Peligrosa María
# Peligrosa María.
# Al despedirnos sonreía
# esperaba, dijo, que la recordaría
# también me deseo mucha suerte
# y yo como un tonto me marche muy
# alegre.
# Al día siguiente lo tenía irritado.
# ¡Ay que horror! estaba colorado
# dos mil "pelas" gaste en penicilina.
# Seguro que me acuerdo de María.
# Ahora entiendo sus palabras
# ahora entiendo sus miradas
# ahora sé porque la llamaban
# Peligrosa María

# He construido castillos en la arena
# tan hermosos que me conformaría
# que las olas de mis penas los derribaran
# y así por fin poder dormir en sus ruinas.
# He construido mis noches en días
# en que las risas eran muecas sin alegría
# y sobre los cimientos de mis pensamientos
# con ladrillos de tiempo fabriqué mis pesadillas.
# He construido sobre tu amor mi vida
# Alicia sin tierra de las maravillas
# princesa del país de las tristezas
# cenicienta sin hada madrina.
# He construido mil horas vacías
# pensando... la suerte está en contra mía
# pozo negro de mi vida rota
# eslabón de esta cadena partida.
# Siempre con miedo y sin saber de que
# esperando al mensajero
# que nunca aparece
# un día más largo que un siglo
# y por fin loco de contento
# o loco y por eso contento.
# Guardaba para un día de lluvia
# contar mis secretos, fatalidad repetida
# pero nunca y siempre hoy se mezclan
# todo está cerrado para mi maldita ventanilla.
# Nadie ve nada, nadie escucha nada
# quizás porque no hay nada que ver
# ni nada que oír, sólo los pasos
# de la procesión de los días.
# Encrucijada de guerras perdidas
# buscando al hacedor de sombras
# al dios del sueño... shhh. Silencio
# el demonio de la nada está aquí, amiga.
# Corazones rotos lo que quiere el mundo
# para continuar con su gira que gira
# he olvidado las manos del diablo

# Ocho de la mañana

# sales a las ocho y media,
# sigue lloviendo en la calle
# pasa una "tía" y la miras

# la vida te ha traicionado

# Por la mañana
# llegas a la fábrica oscura y fría

# Del despacho baja el amo, dice:
# "Hijos míos, no hay trabajo.

# Es el fin, todo ha acabado
# Os miráis con espanto.
# La máquina callada,
# los puños apretados, pensando...

# Ya seis meses sin jornal
# seguro "del paro" agotado,
# dinero cobarde se esconde,
# las empresas han cerrado.
# Por la mitad del salario
# te has ofrecido, es igual.
# Tres millones de parados

# Por última vez lo intentas,
# piensas pedir, tienes la mano.
# También llegas hasta el puente
# pero no puedes, tu hora no ha llegado.
# Espera desesperada,
# en el portal tu mujer.
# Tiene el crédito agotado,
# en casa no hay que comer.
# ¿Qué hay? pregunta cuando llegas.
# tú no contestas y callas,
# agachando la cabeza
# subes pálido a la casa.
# Tu hija arriba no duerme,
# desde ayer no come nada,
# cree que su madre ha bajado
# a comprar pan a la tienda de al lado.
# Entráis los dos en la casa,
# la niña mira tus manos.
# Sorprendida al no ver nada,
# calla y se acuesta llorando.
# El padre está en un rincón

# Era un día como otro
# cualquiera... ni negro ni blanco
# no sé si era largo o corto
# pues como todos empezó acabando.
# Una jornada de un siglo remoto
# perdí ya la cuenta han pasado tantos
# al que llegué poco a poco
# víspera de todos los santos.
# Era cuando la edad vencida
# dice : ¿donde vas pobre loco?,
# abrazando causas perdidas,
# mujeres perdidas... corazones rotos
# El primero o el último día
# da igual quedan solo unos cuantos
# Dios se cansó de dar cuerda a mi vida
# víspera de todos los santos.
# Era un tiempo de horas homicidas
# tu no te enteras... ellas trabajando
# el reloj tic-tac causa heridas
# mientras la vida te va suicidando.
# Fue cuando tras cada esquina
# otra vuelta de tuerca sigue apretando
# besas en la boca a la agonía
# víspera de todos los santos.
# Todos los años puestos en fila
# piden cuentas y tú recordando
# como has perdido lo que querías
# o sin saber te lo fueron robando.
# Solo dios conoce el último día
# la ultima hora. Sonríe callando
# el último número de la lista
# víspera de todos los santos.
# Para escuchar esta canción
# el mejor lugar el infierno
# naces solo. Mueres solo
# no te engañes solo vas viviendo.
# Llegó por fin el mejor día
# martes y trece o viernes santo
# los perros me hacen compañía
# ladran cuando estoy llorando.
# Es cuando muerto de envidia
# miras al mundo pasar paseando
# los caminos son navajas frías
# víspera de todos los santos.
# Noches y noches perdidas
# cientos de horas volando
# llega la señal de la partida
# caigo y aún me voy levantando.
# Apoyado en la ruina
# la compañera que me va quedando
# rechazan tu mano tendida
# víspera de todos los santos.
# Las palabras entre rejas
# otra vez el papel en blanco
# calla, obedece, de que te quejas
# unos mintiendo otros soñando.
# Cuando ves la tarjeta amarilla
# ¿que haces? empujas o sigues tirando
# las ilusiones hechas astillas
# víspera de todos los santos.
# Era quizás el último día
# sin noche... cuando unos cuantos
# se van con la mayoría
# y sin votar terminan ganando.
# Furiosa la muerte me hace signos
# cerca muy cerca me va llamando
# me voy como se cierra un libro
# víspera de todos los santos.
# Para escuchar esta canción
# el mejor lugar el infierno
# naces solo. Mueres solo
# no te engañes solo vas viviendo.

# Jimmy was a fly guy with a bid Mercedes
# he thought he could get all type of ladies
# he makes a lot of money cause he is a money maker
# and if he looks for style he rides jet ski in Jamiaca
# he met this beautiful girl at a bar
# and Jimmy could swear she looked like a star
# he got the most expensive girl in the world
# the most expensive world
# but Jimmy didn't listen- yes he didn't
# his friends warned him- he thought they must be kiddin'
# Jimmy felt in love like he never did before
# for any kiss he gets she takes him to the store
# every time she buys more than Jimmy can carry
# so she employed a butler and his name is: Larry
# he got the most expensive girl in the world
# the most expensive girl
# Jimmy is out of money he spent all on his honey
# He is searchin' for a credit but his friends regret it
# his is workin' at three jobs but that is not enough
# to pay all her needs to pay all her stuff
# I saw her later on a luxury ferry
# and next to her stood a man named Larry
# you got played boy!
# he got the most expensive girl in the world

# I've got no chauffeur to chauffeur me
# I've got no servant to serve my tea
# But I'm as happy as a man can be

# I don't hold claim to no real estate
# But I'm not living my life in vain
# Because I've got a girl who loves nobody but me

# If I could be anything in the world that flew
# I would be a bat and come swooping after you
# And if the last time you were here things were a bit askew
# Well you know what happens after dark
# When rattlesnakes lose their skins and their hearts
# And all the missionaries lose their bark
# Oh, all the trees are calling after you
# And all the venom snipers after you
# Are all the mountains bolder after you?
# If I could be anyone of the things in this world that bite
# Instead of an ocelot on a leash, I'd rather be a kite
# And be tied to the end of your string
# And flying in the air, babe, at night
# Cause ou know what they say about honey bears
# When you shave off all their baby hair
# You have a hairy minded pink bare bear
# And all the balls are rolling out for you
# And stones are all erupting out for you
# And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you
# Yesterday, Daisy Mae and Biff were grooving on the street
# And just like in a movie, her hands became her feet
# Her belly button was her mouth
# Wich meant she tasted what she'd speak
# But the funny thing is what happened to her nose
# It grew until it reached all of her toes
# Now when people say her feet they mean her nose
# And curtains laced with diamonds dear for you
# And all the Roman Noblemen for you
# And kingdom's Christian Soldiers dear for you
# And melting ice cap mountain tops for you
# And knights in flamming silver robes for you
# And bats that with a kiss turn prince for you

# Pull down your top and show me a little tit
# I said hey short girl you're like a midget
# You can turn a phone cord into a widget
# She said you son of a bi*** you little bi***
# I ain't gonna show you my love without a hitch
# I said hey hold up sugar just one at a time
# Show me yours baby I'll show you mine
# She said oh you're so pathetic
# yeah well so...you're so magnetic
# I said hold up girl I know your game
# Ah you want a sugar daddy you can tame
# I said sing, sing me a song
# And bang me like the girls in Hong Kong
# I know I know I ain't correct
# But politics are so much better when there's sex
# I said rollover do me a trick
# Do it with your shoes on it'd be a kick
# Ah tell me the horse that you pick
# Let me buy you a lollipop you want to lick
# She said Does that sh** work with other girls
# If it does, why don't you find one of them to give you twirls
# My love cost pearls
# ah does it baby - you don't say

# Nun l'ha visto comm'a ccà.
# Guarda attuorno sti sserene,
# Ca te guardano 'ncantate
# E te vonno tantu bene...
# Te vulessero vasà.
# E tu dice "I' parto, addio!"
# T'alluntane da stu core...
# Da la terra da l'ammore...
# Tiene 'o core 'e nun turnà
# Ma nun me lassà
# Nun darme stu turmiento!
# Torna a Surriento,
# Famme campà!

# Tra voi, belle, brune e bionde.
# Si nsconde giovinetta vaga, vezzosa...
# Dal labbro rosa, me m'aspetta?
# Sei tu quella, bionda stella?
# Dillo a me!
# Palesatemi il destino, e il divino
# viso ardente che m'innamori...
# Ch'io vegga e... odori...
# Eternamente!
# Sei tu quella, bruna stella?
# Dillo a me!

# Una furtiva lagrima
# negli occhi suoi spuntò...
# quelle festose giovani
# invidiar sembrò...
# Che più cercando io vo?
# M'ama, lo vedo.
# Un solo istante i palpiti
# del suo bel cor sentir!..
# Co' suoi sospir confondere
# per poco i miei sospir!...
# Cielo, si può morir;
# di più non chiedo.
# Eccola... Oh! qual le accresce
# beltà l'amor nascente!
# A far l'indifferente
# si seguiti così finch? non viene
# ella a spiegarsi.

# Recitar! Mentre preso dal delirio
# non so piu quel che dico
# e quel che faccio!
# Eppur, e d'uopo sforzati! Bah
# sei tu forse un uom? Ah! ah! ah!
# Tu se' Pagliaccio!
# Vesti la giubba e
# la faccia infarina.
# La gente paga e rider vuole qua.
# E se Arlecchin t'invo la Columbina,
# ridi, Pagliaccio e ognun
# applaudira!
# Tramuta in lazzi lo spasmo ed il pianto;
# in una smorfia il singhiozzo e 'l dolor.
# Ah!
# Ridi Pagliaccio, sul tuo amore infranto!
# Ridi del duol che t'avvelena il cor!

# Without you, I have room to breathe
# And if I'm weak then you can't see my insecurities
# Without you, I can do what I choose
# Cause when you got no one to love you got nothing to lose
# Will there come a time when my head finds it easier to not think about this
# And I would do any thing to stop the weight of my heart getting heavier
# My only conclusion is
# That nothing compares to you
# No matter where I look
# No matter what I do
# Cause that garden of Eden you took me to
# Is now over grown
# And the love I've known is gone without you
# Is gone without you
# Without you, I can kid myself
# That my idea of perfect love is not a fairytale
# Without you, I don't need to explain
# There's no one to answer to and I got no one to blame
# I can do my thing, cause who cares what tomorrow brings
# When you got nothing to miss
# And every time I hide in the arms of another I realise
# It still comes to this
# That nothing compares to you
# No matter where I look
# No matter what I do
# Cause that garden of Eden you took me to
# Is now over grown
# And the love iv known
# Is gone without you
# What is the flower that never blooms
# What's the night sky without its moon
# If I'm the music you're the tune
# Don't hear a sound here without you
# Cause nothing compares to you
# No matter where I look
# No matter what I do
# Cause that garden of Eden you took me to
# Is now over grown
# Cause nothing compares to you
# No matter where I look
# No matter what I do
# Cause that garden of Eden you took me to
# Is now over grown
# And the love I've known
# Is gone without you
# Is gone without you
# Is gone without you
# The love I've known is gone without you

# When Organized drop the track then start duckin'
# When Ludacris get in the bed start fuckin
# Girl: You wanna be startin something
# Get out the booth and lemme tell you the truth
# We kick down doors
# Save all the H20 for front rows
# Live in the bank and watch for stank hoes
# Stay chromed out and that's on or off road
# If you know what I mean proceed to stay clean
# Light skinded nigga turn red but get green
# Inhale some of that dro but blow steam
# Love a combination big ass and tight jeans

# [Verse 2]
# Girl:  Man you done lost yo mind
# No I've lost my virginity
# And I shot quick
# Like that nigga shot Kennedy
# What's the remedy Hennessey Coke
# If you cut all your money you'd still be half broke
# Ashes to ashes smoke or get smoked
# We come by the masses you come and get smoked
# If you take me for a fool I'll take you for a joke
# Tired of fast food so they cooked up dope
# So now we eatin' lobster shrimp and things
# Watch for imposters that's been in the game
# We invented the game and ya'll just got here
# Dude: Man what's that smell
# PROBABLY YO UPPER LIP
# Cause I love to walk around like my shit don't stink
# Even if its cigars and that purple color dank
# Chillin in the gut with no trace of Tom Hanks
# So put this in yo jaw like weiners and beef franks
# Chorus (Repeat 2X)
# [Verse 3]
# I put too much sugar in my Kool-Aid
# And partied like a kid with a high top fade
# Arrive at the show and I like to get paid
# Arrive to a hoe and I like to get laid
# Ride up on my back like rugs and floormats
# I'm on the right page but what's my format
# I wave to the ocean cause I'm where shores at
# And women go nuts just like my bozack
# Did you know that?
# Man I'm the gift of change
# Electric stoves so give me the keys to the range
# Sagadelic, beautiful but strange
# Went to Magic City saw Nikki and Blue Flame
# Rearrange same broad different night
# Pass the E&J and let a nigga get right
# The bomb threat dude that's on the same flight
# The highlight's that I live a high ass life

# Okay, I remember the days
# High rights, low lefts, even stevens and fades
# Troops, Lottos, and BK's, those was the days
# High tech boots spray painted witcha names
# T-shirts airbrushed that read the same
# Thick herringbone chain, one gold with yo' initial
# Harris Photos, group shots, can you remember?
# Barry him told his bitch go to the prom and die
# Didn't lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5
# When she disobeyed, had North Clayton crazed
# Just to reiterate dog those was the days
# Fo' the invasions of haters, man crews from all around
# used to get down at True Flavas, bumpin Key Lo
# Rockin Damage, Cross Colour and Paco
# While playboys stepped in talent shows
# Prom night, tux and Kangol was so cool
# Fuck them new model cars we ridin' old school (old school)
# [Chorus: Keon Bryce]
# We were tryin so hard
# Hard to survive
# Cause even though we were young
# We had to stay strong
# No matter what we went through
# It was me and my crew
# And that's how it went
# When we were kids
# [Fate Wilson]
# In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown
# Hamwood and Diplomats
# Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats
# We was lovin' that
# Before they started jackin jacks
# For notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through
# College Park after dark, Crown Victorias police unmarked cars
# Be aware, Wayne Williams was out there, but we ain't care
# Kids was gettin stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin
# Double dare ya touch shorty on the ass, that's a bet
# Want your Kool-Aid and sugar, smack your hands and say "sweat"
# It's mine now place it in my Louis Vuitton pouch
# Thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch
# Slouch socks, box Chevy Caprice
# Hot Niss, cut da whole Disturbin' Tha Peace
# wit no conscience, broke niggaz call 'em nonsense
# No comments, it's Lil' Fate payin homage to College Park
# I had a Long John but no Silver, no gold or plat
# I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back
# With two sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches
# And set fires in garbage pales and cabbage patches
# A child of the corn been wild since I was born
# Climbin' over barbed wire, clothes got torn
# Shoes got muddy and my click turned cruddy
# Wherever I go they went they my buddies
# I brush teeth, brush naps and calm streets
# Dreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats
# Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
# Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
# When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for ACTION!
# Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one
# Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
# And be with the people makin all that got damn noise, man

# You ho*s are horrible, horrendous
# On taxes ya'll writin' off ho*s as dependents
# I see tha ho* risin'
# It ain't surprisin'
# Its just a ho*asis
# With ugly chicks' faces
# But ho*s don't feel so sad and blue
# 'Cause most of us niggaz is ho*s too
# Repeat chorus twice
# (Ho)
# Muthafuckas I'm so tired of y'all niggaz always talkin'
# 'Bout ho*s this, ho*s that, you tha muthafuckin' ho* nigga
# I wasn't no ho* last night

# Ho, bring yo as*!
# (Ho)
# Ok, hold on
# (Chorus)
> Ludacris
# Ooh..You feel that
# As I take you to them dirt roads deep down in your southern roots
# Where nobody said life was gon be easy
# And we travel through this emotional rollercoaster called life
# and we have our ups and downs
# Just keep in mind, when you hit rock bottom
# There ain't nowhere to go but up baby
# Just all about how you deal with it, ya feel me
# Listen here
# (Chorus 2X: Ludacris) + [Trick Daddy]
# When life seems hopeless
# It make a nigga lose focus
# Empty beer bottles and roaches
# [Helps to get it off my chest
# Cause I'm so stressed
# And all I hear is] FUCK THE WORLD
# Man, ever since life's been a gamble, my lifes been in shambles
# Double-edge swords burning both sides of the candle
# But Chris, you can't handle the truth
# Don't wanna face reality
# So lower than accept my apology
# Please like when police say freeze
# And I ain't do shit but I'm down on my knees
# Its a crooked system but gin straight take the pain away
# I charge the game and put my problems on layaway
# A black man but I feel so blue
# So I smoke green and purple til my dreams come true
# And my eyes turn red, the sky turns grey
# Children slangin white in the hood, we call it yay
# Drinkin' Ol' Gold down my yellow brick road
# Where we write my script until my storys been told
# See, I got a little money and my lifes been up
# Now I'm fallen and I can't get up
# [Trick Daddy]
# I had a dream about a dope fiend
# And its strange cause he get a bentley right away
# seem to get just for bout anything
# Pure survival, I want to talk with him
# He said he was too busy for that but I was more than willing the walk with him
# So as we walked, he talked and I just listened
# He said theres a big difference between crackers and niggaz
# And he said white folks look out for the white folks
# But uhh...black folks blame other black folks when there ain't enough black folks
# But yo...to make a long story short
# We need to pay more attention and do things thats way more convincing
# He told me you know, I wouldn't say something that wasn't worth it
# And I damn sure wouldn't waste my time tellin you something that'll hurt you
# Its your fault for anything if you done stand for something thats for certain
# But niggaz don't be listenin and that shit be hurtin
# Not all of us but some of us
# And if we don't hurry up, they gon bury each and every life of us
# Sometimes I can't deal with my daily issues just being sober
# Lifes a bitch and I can't control her
# I wish I could and sometimes to cry on we need a shoulder
# The government stand us up to run us over
# And in the hood, they don't seem to understand, god damn
# What's really got me wondering if this part of the bigger plan?
# Man I smell something fishy going on
# Its way beyond blowing away the smoke from all of swishas going on
# There ain't much that I can do about it (no)
# But preach the word, tell my peoples spend your money wisely (yup)
# Don't be absurd by somethings that are fishy (Like what)
# Like at home, wake up and open your eyes to what the fuck is going on
# Cause they constantly getting rid of us (yup)
# One by one, whether its drugs or diseases or its gun by gun
# I ain't no saint either, I feel I'm even doing wrong
# By using whats in this chorus to get through this song
# [Trick Daddy]
# You know, y'all gonna mess around and keep on complaining
# Bout slavery and umm that was over 40-50 years ago, you know
# Black folks need to move on
# no stay strong and umm, y'all keep playing with us crackers
# They gonna have your ass somewhat tied up, wired up
# Of the backroads of South Florida, Georgia you know
# And they make it so God can't do nothing for you
# Can a church get an Amen
# God for the thugs too
# Amen
> Ludacris
# Yeh, ohh!
# Check me out, look
# It goes love, hate, pleasure and pain
# Fo' albums in the can and I'm STILL in the game (what up?)
# And last album, they don't like me to tell this
# Debuted at #1 and sold more records than Elvis (shut up!)
# That's what they tellin me, switch up your melody
# Through with misdemeanors, they tryin to give rappers felonies
# So they can lock us up one at a time
# But true writers stay FREE in e'ry one of our lines
# And if you not feelin I'm the cream of the crop
# I'll KNOCK rappers off your list 'til I get to the top!
# Still you lookin at a man that's financially stable
# Only nigga gettin checks cut from four different labels
# That Pillsbury dough, women poke my guts
# Still I walk around the streets like I'm broke as f***
# So if you see me in your town and I appear to be moody
# It's cause I'm thinkin 'bout plans that's bigger than Serena booty
# Me and Shaka still starvin and lookin for meals
# And HEADS UP! Ludacris is almost out of his deal
# I'm over ten million sold, every album is CRACK
# And for now I'm bout to carry Def Jam on my BACK
# Mad rappers I hear you talkin way down at the bottom
# Though I make big money, still handle small problems
# The ramblin at the mouth, I don't PLAY THAT sh**
# I'm the best and I ain't really got SAY THAT sh**!
> Ludacris
# [Chorus 4X]
# In this life one thing counts
# In the bank, large amounts
# [Luda speaks in the background]
# [Verse One]
# Now everybody wants a piece of my pie
# And it don't help when I'm screaming on these records that I'm rich
# Calling people from my number now I Bligh
# Cuz there's nothing worse then getting horned by a stockin' ass bi*** (oh yeah)
# Cuz good game are talkin' and yet you're so true some women will have you feeling blue like cris
# I lay my feet upon the path and now I'm walkin'
# I spread my well (?) someone close will have me layin' in a ditch
# I have my friends steal from me
# Snatch my credit card and my wallet hit the town and leave (?) bills for me
# They say I got the cash for it and I can't recall one single member of my family that never
# asked for it
# They've been kicking down doors and bustin' out flows
# They can't get me on the phone so they surprise me at my show
# And everybody needs a loan plus they say they won't blow it
# All I hear 'common cuss you know I'm good for it' (man)
# [Chorus 4X]
# [Verse Two]
# Now don't get me wrong cuz being rich is such a beautiful thing
# But more money, more problems people drive me insane
# Now giving no handouts no more so take advantage and flee
# My goal's to set my friends up to make some paper like me
# Put them in position and make their wishes come...true
# So they can have multiple accounts gain interest over night
# Given a million dollars, what you gone...do?
# Wrap your life for your kids-kids or would you spend it over night?
# Now see me I do both I got a limited fun
# My daughters life was set before (?) turned one
# And it don't help that I got 4 or 5 retirement funds
# So if I (?) before I'm 30 I can lay in the sun
# My (?) can show and prove the real meaning of fun
# That's why I live by the sword but you can die by my gun
# The IRS `ll never sweat me or even put up a fight
# Cuz I'm sure I pay more in taxes then you made in your life
# Because...
# [Chorus 4X]
# [Verse Three]
# Now women these days don't want a man without a nice pay check
# So he splurge even though our lives ain't in right place yet
# Buying jewellery and some cars just to impress these w****s
# Meanwhile you (?) poor 'daddy why you left me for?'
# Yeah but it all comes back that's why I named my daughter Karma (yup)
# Who teaching me the lesson of life and making me smarter
# I sweep her off her feet cuz I'm her knight in shining armour
# And I have your f***ing head if anybody tries to harm her
# Got to teach her about the game that most of us niggaz are spitin?
# About these scandalous ass women that get money thru gifts
# They suck a cold hard wood for some cold hard cash
# Or ride a brother good to put a foot up on the gas
# So that brand new ride pick up our friends
# While you're slippin` she slides
# Drop top Benz gold diggers inside
# Crazy what the world will do for money
# Thinking that everything will be alright
# Cuz...
# [Chorus repeat till end]

# O, bratje, nikar teh zvokov,
# temveč vse bolj milo pesmico zapojmo
# In vse bolj radostno!
# Radost!
# Radost, od Boga nam dana ,
# Hčerka ti Elizijska,
# V tempelj, kjer si nam prižgana,
# Stopamo, božanstvena!
# Združil čar nam tvoj bogat je,
# Kar razbil je kruti čas
# Vsi ljudje ljudem so bratje,
# Če jim ti zvedriš obraz.
# Komur je naključje dalo,
# Da ima prijatelja,
# Kdor dobil je ženko zalo,
# Naj veselju duška da!
# Srečen, kdor ima na zemlji
# Eno samo dušico!
# Kdor pa sam trpiš, ne jemlji
# Naše sreče nam za zlo!
# Radost pije vsako bitje
# Z grudi, ki jih zemlja da
# Vsak, kdor dober in odkrit je,
# Radosti sladkost pozna.
# Radost daje vinsko trto,
# Daje nam prijatelja
# Črv ima k nji pot odprto
# Kakor kerub do Boga!
# Z njo kot božje sonce smelo
# Hodi čez nebesni svod,
# Pojdi, človek, svojo pot
# K zmagi kot junak veselo!
# Naj objamem milijone!
# Naj poljubim božji svet!
# Bratje, čez nebo razpet
# Bog, naš oče, ne zatone!
# Mar se treseš, zemlja siva
# Slutiš, kaj je stvarnik, svet?
# Išči med svetovi sled:
# Nad zvezdami on prebiva!

# Oh friends, not these tones!

# ODE TO JOY (Friedrich Schiller)
# BARITONE, QUARTET, AND CHORUS
# Joy, beautiful spark of the gods,
# Daughter of Elysium,
# We enter fire imbibed,
# Heavenly, thy sanctuary.
# Thy magic reunites those
# Whom stern custom has parted;
# All men will become brothers
# Under thy gentle wing.
# May he who has had the fortune
# To gain a true friend
# And he who has won a noble wife
# Join in our jubilation!
# Yes, even if he calls but one soul
# His own in all the world.
# But he who has failed in this
# Must steal away alone and in tears.
# All the world's creatures
# Draw joy from nature's breast;
# Both the good and the evil
# Follow her rose-strewn path.
# She gave us kisses and wine
# And a friend loyal unto death;
# She gave lust for life to the lowliest,
# And the Cherub stands before God.
# TENOR SOLO AND CHORUS
# Joyously, as his suns speed
# Through Heaven's glorious order,
# Hasten, Brothers, on your way,
# Exulting as a knight in victory.
# CHORUS
# Joy, beautiful spark of the gods,
# Daughter of Elysium,
# We enter fire imbibed,
# Heavenly, thy sanctuary.
# Be embraced, Millions!
# This kiss for all the world!
# Brothers!, above the starry canopy
# A loving father must dwell.
# Can you sense the Creator, world?
# Seek him above the starry canopy.
# Above the stars He must dwell.
# Be embraced, Millions!
# This kiss for all the world!
# Brothers!, above the starry canopy
# A loving father must dwell.

# Završili smo pismo...
# nismo svesni da smo niko.
# Isto kao juce - svada.
# Danas, radamo se s' slikom...
# "Nasmejana lica"... ruke stisak:
# "Cao, Miko! Reci, zašto smo ovakvi?"
# Zatim, otpratim te tikom.
# Tik je suza ta što nikad nije uz'la
# za zlo da koristi uzdah,
# i laže "bolje je sutra"...
# Puta 100 sam se, glupak,
# oslanjao na vreme,
# nadao se boljem bez truda...
# a l', eto... nema veze...
# Ostalo je vreme
# da nas pregazi k'o prah.
# Danas sam i dobre volje.
# Možda i vidim sunca zrak.
# Al' kako videti tebe?
# Suza k'o savest što grebe,
# licem mi umorno tece,
# pece me prokleto vreme...
# Zašto smo stali bezveze,
# kada sam stao uz tebe,
# kada sam znao da grebe,
# tebe, misao da greše...?
# Ti ljudi greše, ne ti, pa sam uz tebe!
# Evo trece 'dine skoro od kako ne znam za sebe.
# Ref:
# Na tren mi dode da suzu pustim.
# Gledam te i samo cutim.
# Bojim se u mraku jer bez tebe nisam navik'o.
# Na nebu k'o sitni ljudi.
# Zašto smo davno mrtvi?
# Ponekad, zapitam se...
# zašto sam te uopšte imao.
# Dr. Iggy sempl:
# "Hiljadu si puta rek'o reci koje ništa ne znace.
# Koje, kad ih kažeš ti - gube svaku draž.
# Ma koliko puta pricao mi ti o svojoj ljubavi,
# ja sam svesna da je sve to laž.
# (2x)
# Plašim se, da naneceš mi boli,
# jer covek jednom voli kao što volim ja.
# Plašim se, da nikad neceš znati
# koliko duša pati, što mnogo te je volela!
# Plašim se!"
# II:
# I ja, plašim se, veruj!
# Matori uvek preteruju.
# Znam na šta sve teraju.
# Kada ne godi - zakeraju!
# Šta spremaju?
# Covek na greškama uci,
# na svojim, ne tudim...
# ludim što moram da trpim!
# Što drugi nam sudi!
# Kontam da ljudi su glupi...
# kontam da zbuni ih uzvik
# kad placeš zbog mene. Žudim...
# da budim se s' tobom,
# gubim al’ borim se s' zlobom,
# ljutim i smirim se ponovo.
# Istim bolom pišem doslovno.
# Život me gazi k’o cizma.
# nikad te pustio nisam.
# I kad se boriš sa svima,
# ja sam tu stajao - iza,
# ja sam tu stajao, i šta?
# Hajde da probamo, ipak,
# da živimo...
# svi da znaju da nema nas...
# Njima daljina da kidiše reci,
# jer svako voli da necim
# tako bednim veceg savlada!
# Zar to nismo ti i ja?
# Bili...
# Sad' drugim životom da živim?
# Kreni drugom, dugom stazom.
# Zato plašim se da živim, ja...
# Ref:
# Na tren mi dode da suzu pustim.
# Gledam te i samo cutim.
# Bojim se u mraku jer bez tebe nisam navik'o.
# Na nebu k'o sitni ljudi.
# Zašto smo davno mrtvi?
# Ponekad, zapitam se...
# zašto sam te uopšte imao.
# Dr. Iggy sempl:
# "Hiljadu si puta rek'o reci koje ništa ne znace.
# Koje, kad ih kažeš ti - gube svaku draž.
# Ma koliko puta pricao mi ti o svojoj ljubavi,
# ja sam svesna da je sve to laž.
# (2x)
# Plašim se, da naneceš mi boli,
# jer covek jednom voli kao što volim ja.
# Plašim se, da nikad neceš znati
# koliko duša pati, što mnogo te je volela!
# Plašim se!"

# Lord they really think they fooling you by coming to church on Sunday
# praying and laying hands on folks stomping and jumping around faking the holy ghost
# but its a thin line between walking it and talking it
# living it and giving it or just pretending it's alright
# and did they really think that they could pull the wool over your eyes lord
# did they really think that by faking they were saved that they would get the same reward
# this be the realest thing I ever wrote for sure
# after this a lot of folks wont like me no mo'
# but after this I gotta go answer to you Lord
# so I've made up my mind I'm a go to church on Sunday
# and sing a song that may hurt somebody's feelings so that maybe
# thy will, will be done
# on earth as it is in heaven
# and hopefully they will see
# how much they really be discouraging a little old sinner like me
# [2nd Verse:]
# And Lord who they think they jiving by singing these songs full of glory
# then out in the world it's a different story
# I'm running out of people to pray for me
# I'm not trying to act like I'm the perfect man
# but if you speak about it, you should be about it not just preach about it all day
# cause if you do you run the risk of chasing some of the most beautiful people away
# and it is never my intention to discourage you rather encourage you to change your life today
# this be the realest thing I ever had to say, but after this a lot of folks wont like me no mo'
# but after this I gotta go answer to you Lord
# so I've made up my mind I'm a go to church on Sunday

# Well, it ain't no fun

# Every woman's out there lookin' for a rich man
# And every man's out there looking for a perfect ten
# Can't always get what you want sometimes
# So your better off just takin' what you can
# Money won't make you happy baby
# And a perfect woman son's gonna make you sad
# If you think that's where it's at, then I'm telling you, your wrong
# Cause you can have it all one day and then it's gone
# You can search all of your life, and still not find
# What you want, ain't what you've got
# Good lovin' so hard to find
# Could this be the right place, at the right time
# Good lovin', feels so fine
# I just can't get enough
# Cause good lovin's hard to find,so hard to find
# We all need good lovin'
# Ain't talkin' about no one night stand
# Some have the touch, and others just a hand
# But when you find the right one then you'll understand
# Can't always get what you want sometimes
# So you're better off just takin' what you can
# You can search all of your life, and still not find
# What you want ain't what you've got
# Good lovin' so hard to find
# Could this be the right place at the right time
# Good lovin' feels so fine
# I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
# Some of that good good love
# Some of that good good love
# Some of that good, good love
# Good lovin'
# So hard to find
# Good lovin'
# Make you loose your mind
# Good lovin'
# Good good love
# Good lovin'

# A chill in the air, something wrong
# When a shadow crosses the ground
# Those long lost souls never make a sound
# You'd think by now they'd realize
# She'll never break her bayou ties
# She's the daughter of the devil, the sister of a snake
# The keeper of souls down on Voodoo Lake
# Voodoo Lake, Voodoo Lake
# Daughter of the Devil, sister of a snake
# Voodoo Lake
# Down on Voodoo Lake, Down on Voodoo Lake
# You can see her down on Voodoo Lake

# Like a restless leaf in the autumn breeze
# Once I was a tumblin' weed
# Like a rollin' stone, cold and all alone
# Living for the day my train would come
# I never cared for school or any golden rules
# Papa used to always say I was a useless fool
# So I left my home to show them thay was wrong
# And headed out on the road singing my song
# Then one sunny day. The man, he looked my way
# And everything that I dreamed of, it was real
# Money, girls and cars; and big long cigars
# And I caught the first plane home so papa would see
# When I went home to show 'em they was wrong
# All that I found was two tombstones
# Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong
# Oh, such a sad song
# First I got lost, then I got found
# But the ones that I love are in the ground
# Papa I only wish you could see me now
# Take a listen papa
# Whoo, I learnt how to play my guitar
# Gonna be a superstar
# First I got lost, then I got found
# The ones I love are in the ground
# Won't you tell me please was I right or wrong
# If there's any way you can hear what I say
# Papa, I never meant to do you wrong
# All the money, girls and cars. And all the words and all the cigars
# Papa, I just want you to know they couldn't take your place
# When I went home to show 'em they was wrong
# All that I found was two tombstones
# Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong
# Oh, such a sad song
# First I got lost, then I got found
# But the ones that I love are in the ground
# Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong

# This is a story 'bout livin'
# A tale of a long hard road
# Ain't a whole lot of misgivin's
# Of the things that I thought I sowed
# My daddy was a real hard worker
# He said son there will come a day
# Talk ain't always cheap
# And here's what daddy had to say
# With these hands I've made my livin'
# With these hands I've held a child
# With these hands I've climbed a mountain
# Sometimes we forget
# We ain't much different at all
# He likes grits, you like the apple
# There ain't nothin' wrong with that
# He says y'all, you say you'se
# It all depends on where you're at
# Well a little bit of music is a whole lot of fun
# And its always good for the soul
# From New York City out to California
# You know its only rock and roll
# With these hands we come together
# With these hands we can change the world
# With these hands I play my music
# Sometimes we forget
# We ain't much different at all
# Oh, not at all
# So what I'm trying to tell you
# Is that I'm only one son of the South
# Its gonna take more than you me and you
# To work this whole thing out
# With these hands I've made my livin'
# With these hands I've held a child
# With these hands I've climbed a mountain
# Sometimes we forget
# With these hands we come together
# With these hands we can change the world
# With these hands I play my music
# Sometimes we forget
# We ain't much different
# We ain't much different
# Ain't much different
# At all

# You must be out of your damn mind, I had to grind too hard
# Please step away from the V, and get the fuck up out my yard

# But in front of my face, you have nothing but praise
# It's like that oh naw, y'all done up and done it now
# Need to move around, 'fore repercussions come down
# I do my thang, I mean I do the damn thang to the fullest
# It's all done been identified, the pistol if you pull it
# And you rookies better recognize, the game before it plays you
# And get you caught up in complications, or like what the snakes do
# And still, I just remain the same

# His name is (Lyrics Born)
# and he is, as they say, wild and crazy
# As a composer, arranger, and producer
# He's exploring it all
# From the furthest reaches of musical outer space
# To the most down to earth funk
# And he sounds, well, he sounds exactly like this
# [Verse 1]
# Nobody 'members those
# Rap City episodes from twenty years ago
# When you were the guest host
# Past history, let it go
# Get off on a medical
# Pack a duffle bag with all your wrinkled clothes and pedal home
# Get a little dictaphone and sit alone
# In the middle of the room and let it flow
# Wouldn't it be better
# If you went and chose a new career path
# Like a shepherd or a flight attendant on an aircraft?
# You're pitiful, a pollywog
# Tiny fishy in a smaller pond
# Holding barbie dolls and leftover beads from the Mardi Gras
# Actin hella hard but that's just poppycock
# 'Cause inside you're hella soft like a Jolly Rancher lollypop
# I'll give you cauliflower ears stupid
# You're weird
# Feelin blue
# On a stool somewhere, two-fisting beers
# At a Hofbrau
# Moaning like a hot cow
# Cryin on the shoulder of some old man you met just now
# I'm smarter than you
# I'm harder than you
# I'm better than you
# I'm just raw
# I'm hotter than you
# More popular than you
# More clever than you
# And goshdarn it, people like me
# I'm smarter than you
# I'm harder than you

# More clever than you
# And goshdarn it, people like me

# Look I'm sorry, mate
# This is awkward, k?
# Little hard to say
# So I'll just say it
# Me and your mommy date
# She's awfully great
# She's a soft seatmate (?)
# She calls me late
# Always wants to meet
# On her coffee breaks
# She bought me seats
# To Bonnie Raitt
# Now there's no concrete date
# But she bought the ring
# It's Marjorie May (?)
# And my stockings stink
# From my foot up in your ass
# 'Cause you drive me absolutely batty
# See I'm crabby when you get around me
# Tell me who's your daddy
# Call me Mister McAffee, your poop-deck pappy
# Shut your trap and get back in the backseat of the Camry
# Don't sass me or I'll backhand you
# smack you with an axe-handle
# Burn you with a wax candle
# Slap you with a sandle
# I'm trying to watch the rap channel
# Can't you tell we laugh about you?
# Call yourself a rapper but I gives a rat's ass about you
# [Verse 3]
# Why do I even bother with these Hoff-brand cats
# Y'all are wombats man
# I'm bout to blow this pop stand
# Lyrically y'all don't compare to me in any contest
# Like a stealth bomber up against a Hyundai Accent
# Tall-can to a shot glass

# Gary Coleman versus Big Boss Man
# The Loch Ness Monster up against a crawdad
# Talking Sly Stallone in Rocky versus Sly Stallone in Copland

# Better yet, Broadband
# Compared to a long ass
# Piece of string connecting two pop cans
# It's all bad
# Don't quit your job at all believe me you'll be so glad back
# Hold on with both hands
# It's sucks washing sauce pans
# I know there's an off chance that one day hip-hop heads
# Will maybe feel rappers in the top-ten that crossdress
