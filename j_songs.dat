# Her brain cells gone
# The last thing she said was let no one steer you wrong, I'm grown
# They ask me, do I believe in God
# So I ask them, did I defeat the odds
# [Verse 2]
# sh** f***ed up but I can't turn away now
# Sold dope around the town, self esteem way down
# Jessie made me tougher, he boxed me up
# My mama put me in the system, she locked me up
# Now this around the time that we lived on Haley
# When I think about it I don't know none of my family
# Except, for the immediate ones
# Thats why I run to the streets and the gennies hand guns
# He don't talk much so everybody wanna fight him
# Every school I went to nobody liked him
# Never could it be right
# I'd try sometimes
# So I chilled by myself and cry sometimes
# And all I ask from Gods to buy sometime
# Would I bring his name in it If I was lyin'
# Now look at what the f*** I done, done
# Terry Jones last son, this is a blessing
# I'm grown
# La, la, la, la, la, la, la
# Now they ask me how you know so much at 17
# What you mean
# You never seen a disfuctional teen
# La, la, la, la, la, la, la, woah
# Times got har I had to get harder
# Let me take that back I had to get smarter

# It was gone that started to offend me
# Child support hit, that really offend me
# Puffy was right it's all about the benjie's
# Bitter now cuz the loves still in me
# In my boxers on couch, sippin' Remy
# Thinkin' that she need to be killed like Kennedy
# Then I listen to I got the remedy
# After all I still give you what you need, cuz we got a daughter to feed
# Though you supposed to be here at least you sold me that
# Why the fuck did I listen when you told me that stupid
# [Chorus 2x]
# [J-Kwon talkin over music]
# You know, you feal my story
# Write me or something ya know what I'm sayin
# Or I'll be in a town near you or, or
# Your town or whatever ya know
# Come see me and come tell me that ya know
# It's been a long time traveling
# Though you was supposed to be here
# So uh, ya family can't say I'm wrong
> J-Live
# Can't even call this a blues song
# It's been so long
# Neither one of us was wrong or anything like that
# It seems like yesterday
# In the silence of the city night
# When the lonely watch the sky in yearning
# I, at rest, lie in peace beside you
# I searched a thousand skies before you came
# [Verse 1]
# For the 4th 3rd, I Chris Columbus three words from Stevie for the issue
# The only thing to call it was official
# The way I live for you was as if I die with you
# Cause not a moment I spent with you was artifical
# The plan from the dome was to build a home with you
# Forever had a space in my heart, I roam with you
# Hypothetical dreams conjure when I met you
# See, years grew between us and stil I can't forget you
# Regretting how I ever let you let me let you escape fools paradise
# Running from a paradox
# Living like a pair of ducks, but with different flocks
# With different destinations, our ships remain docked
# Temporary, but the feelings that I harbor stil wade
# In the holy waters that made our sweet lemonaid
# Too dumb to persist, too smart to persuade
# Too heavy to push aside and too stong to stay
# Too hard to work and so easy to play
# Like chopsticks, what I picked slipped away
# Leaving me to recollect day by day
# And take solace in the words Bill say
# Memories take you back, to the good times
# When it's over and sad times disappear
# Memories take you back
# To the lean times, in between times
# To the days of yesteryear
# Memories are that way
# [Verse 2]
# Memories are that way, that way back to that way back
# When I could never think of you and say "wack"
# Similar to old cassettes, something to cuss at
# Deteriorating with each rewind and playback
# Even now, one of the hits I remenice
# On this angelic face, reciplicating bliss
# With the radio low, your feet anchored in mine
# Hands to waistline, walking to a bassline
# Good food in my belly, good love on my mind
# Turn around to a kiss deep enough to stop time
# Open up to a smile so bright, I go blind
# To the suffering of the world, everything appears fine
# Poetry in the bed, literally
# You putting me open to Stephanie and Giovanni
# With legs entwined, trading profound lines
# Fingers and spines aligned, digging in your mind like it's mine
# Sometimes at night it seem so damn right
# Just to shift nose to neck, just to get a whiff
# I've never seen life like this, so life-like
# This is how I'd like my life to subsist
# But somewhere in between us were interpetations
# Of justice and Jesus, cultures in said nations
# But if I woulda knew what I know now, mighta never known how
# Memories take you back, to the good times
# When it's over
# I searched a thousand skies before you came
# And in the morning, when the world is new
# The lonely turn away, as I turn to you, beside me
# [Verse 3]
# The greatest story ever erased and never replaced
# The worst torture ever I faced
# Was trying to retrace the steps in my mind
# Like a defeated surgeon fighting fate with the cure
# Just a little too late
# We went from "Yo, who's that?" to "Hi, my name is Jay"
# To hoping I would run into you in the hallway
# To "That's my homegirl, peace queen, how ya been?"
# To "Lemme get your number, damn do I have a pen?"
# From "May I speak to please, who's this?  to 'Hey!'"
# To hear the joy in your voice I call you every day
# The VCR blue screen lit the dark room
# Miles and Gil, "Quiet Nights" that was our tune
# But fridays dates and saturdays prayer
# Lead to sundays break-up, and mondays make-up
# As just friends up until tuesdays wake up
# Together again, in a cycle that never ends
# My young heart coulda swore love transcends
# But two turntables alone don't make a blend
# The tracks are too different for "ifs, buts and sos"
# But if it's so right?
# Never mind, we both know
# Sometimes I wonder if you married my replacement
# Equally old with ideas adjacent
# You build a whole nother story to your dream house
# Kept my possessions in a box in the basement
# I stil consider you a song bird, singing in the open cage
# Guilded with fools gold, but that's just me
# There never be no animocity, I'm thankful for the memories
# All I ask is that you remember me
# In the silence of the city night
# When the lonely watch the sky in yearning
# I, at rest, lie in peace beside you
# I searched a thousand skies before you came
# And in the morning, when the world is new
# The lonely turn away, as I turn to you, beside me
# And in the quiet of the afternoon, when the lonely roam
# I turn beside, and you are with me stil
# I roamed a thousand miles before you came
> J-Live
# [Verse One]
# Yo I rock shit like this to leave skid marks
# The way a point blank unchained pit barks
# Or like the wide open jaws of a black shark
# I'm like the starts that make your kids wanna get Clarks
# Cause now you see me now you don't, first you feel me now you won't
# Feel nothing but detached from yourself
# So when the mic was detached from my hand niggaz ran
# Like the rifle was detached from the shelf
# So when the crowd say you're whack and you gots to go
# Step back or end up in a hospital
# You got three hits on who 'bout to rock the show
# Six foot God farmer growin' crops of flow
# You better recognize just how we do (just how we do)
# We let that hot shit simmer just for you (simmer just for you)
# We bridge the gap between the old and new (between the old and new)
# When I say what school is it y'all say true (y'all say true)
# [Verse Two]
# You make the call in this lyrical brawl one for all
# All against one by one just for fun
# No timeouts is called once my game's begun
# Cause if skills are raw then rhymes are well-done
# Son, who's the devil in the landslide?
# Tryin' to maintain when names don't amount to a shit stain
# You could roll deeper than Farrakhan it's still on
# J turns that ambush into that marathon
# Cause if mad heads was dere then mad heads was pet
# Cause mad heads could fly yo, mad heads could jet
# The stage is set and you drown in your own sweat
# There's no point in getting upset cause my shit's not done yet
# Just pray to God I be due by sunset
# I'm liver than electrical outlets when wet
# It might be time left to place one bet
# On just how bad the ? regret their threats
# You swing hits like the Mets well I'll be, the whole fucking MLB
# So tell me why let your dog loose if you scared to sick 'em?
# Would be suspects make the best victims
# [Verse Three]
# So yo how amped am I?
# Got muthafuckers askin how damp am I for sweatin' J LI
# VE add an R by all my rhymes that fly
# Median in my third eye if I lie
# That's why would mean battling this fuckin' with that pussy MC
# Whose whack rhymes are a STD
# Cause if a dope rhyme's a jim hat
# I run through more Trojans than Notre Dame fullbacks at USC
# So what's the weather like? all of the above would be caused by me
# Cause year round I'm down for put it on ya
# They wanted me to fall but instead I went ta
# Spring, summer, these all season flavors upon ya
# I'm comin' through to warn ya or you're a ? goner
# Those who sleep better realize how steep the first step to fucking with me
# Happens to be, extra steady claming how that can never happen to me
# But steadily makin' empty threats trying to gas me
# With gun talk when rhymes remain unleaded
# And my tank's not empty yet
# Whoever thought had a Microsoft Word lets you curse or press edit
# And scroll down to undo rhyme go to file
# hit save and quit cause you ain't printin' shit
# Matter fact if you don't take them disses off your disk
# I'm a download a virus and crash your whole system
# [Chorus 3x]

# I was there when you were a queen.
# And I'll be the last one there beside you.

# We met in a bar
# Out on Chesapeake Bay
# With her white patent boots
# And her blouse red lame
# A table top dancer
# She would smile on cue
# Oh those lips of an angel
# Angel in blue
# She'd been dancin for ages
# Through cities of bars
# She was kickin' the habit
# Of scoring in cars
# She'd been drained of her spirit
# All caged up in this zoo
# A wild cat angel
# Angel in blue
# And as she stared out into nowhere
# I thought yes I thought she might break down and cry
# Oh when I whispered I thought I could love her
# She just said, "Baby don't even bother to try"
# And I watched as she spoke
# Her words chilled my bones
# All her friends did her favors
# That were really just loans
# And she never had dreams
# So they never came true
# Oh the palest of angels
# Angel in blue
# And the bees they had stung her
# The birds they had flown
# There were guys she could number
# But none had she known
# And she never had dreams
# So they never came true
# Oh my fade away angel
# Angel in blue
# Angel in blue

# It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
# It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
# But there are facts in our lives
# We can never change
# Just tell me that you understand and you feel the same
# This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
# I'd live a thousand lives
# Each one with you right by my side
# But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
# And so it seems like we'll never have the chance
# Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
# And you can't stop move on even though you try
# Ain't it strange when your feeling things you shouldn't feel
# Oh, I wish this could be real
# Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
# And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
# Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
# In the story of your heart
# Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
# I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
# Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
# And I don't think that I could face it all again
# I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
# A deeper love I've found in you
# And I no longer doubt
# You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
# And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid
# Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
# And you can't stop move on even though you try
# Ain't it strange when your feeling things you shouldn't feel
# Oh, I wish this could be real
# Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
# And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
# Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
# In the story of your heart
# I locked away my heart
# But you just set it free
# Emotions I felt
# Held me back from what my life should be
# I pushed you far away
# And yet you stayed with me

# Hold on!
# This is how it all begins
# You call your friends
# I'll call my friends.
# We'll all be friends
# And hang out at the mansion
# At the Hamptons on weekends.
# Then it all ends.
# And the question is
# (Chorus 1X)
# Have you even been touched like I touch ya?
# Been held like I hold ya?
# Been loved like I love ya?
# Be Real. Be Real.
# Have you ever been seen like I see ya?
# Been heard how I hear ya?
# Been felt how I feel ya
# Be Real. Be Real.
# Girl ya my

# But sometimes it gets a little cloudy
# Don't it?
# Them sunny days
# See the sunrise
# And wish that it could hit ya
# Face it.
# I'd be great
# To get up every morning
# To eggs and steak.
# But you can't be late
# So we separated on good terms
# And no ones concerned
# About who ya been f***in
# And who ya f***ed last.
# But when I see ya
# Still my question to ask is.

# It could be much worse, I could be hotter than yo scrubs
# Mask and glove, gun hot from burnin ass up
# I'd rather be bossed up, wit a bunch of broads
# The preachers daughter screaming out "Fuck the law!"
# I play a struck chord, wit the Christians
# But y'all got the freakiest bitches out of all the religions
# And God gave me his blessings to handle my business
# All these wanksta snitches, let the nina blow kisses
# If she some how misses, he gon' meet the mistress
# And "Clap that boy" like Birdman and Clipse
# I got these niggaz all over my dick, like hoes

# Verse 1
# Look at my life style it's dangerous
# When i was young this saught of life was contagious
# Hustling hard like them shark down in Vegas
# My gat and I come buss spontaneious
# This world made us only to take what they gave us
# The game is our loss watch yo gloat
# Then show you that this world ain't yours push crack like swinging doors
# And leave strips wide open Ja's holding a pair of mines and yawl cats folding
# My life ain't been at all goldin this rhyme hit me at a young age
# And kept calling i know i'm falling, to the evil of money and drugs
# And loss woman but that's what i'm loving about living
# Being I see my birth as a given
# Knowing my inner limits this game ain't no scrimage
# let's play big were winners
# Beg the lord for forgiveness for when i die please take me off your shit list
# Cause i'll be nameless
# Puttin me through changes the J to the A niggas know the flows crazy
# Chorus (2x)
# Verse 2
# I got a lust for this money
# Admire them old timers, assume with no conscience
# Made aa word so chaotic, opened up my mind and introduced me to narcotics
# Brand new wips not this thicks the hottest chicks
# I just can't seem to keep them off of my dicks
# The difference is yawl did yawl thing on the low, made a lot of doe
# We did our thing hihg pro thought
# We still blew I wish I knew dirty money was evil
# I never understood till I lost a few people
# Dead and gone still their memory lives on throw a mural up
# Let them niggas know their was loved now we're in to better thing
# Got our hands on ring crime in the streets cause it's my time
# I drag think line between love and war
# Really nigga you with me your flossing out side, that you fear me literally
# Strait up and down with no cross as God as my witness
# And Ja is yours i'm a spit in your directions hit the floor nigga
# Chorus (2x)
> Ja Rule
# Daddy's little baby, must learn this world is shady
# And the color of your skin don't make you less of a lady
# Degrade yourself, never cuz I'm teaching you better
# Life ain't all about cheddar diamonds and leather
# Understand you a black sister, in this white man's
# World, don't let it get ya, down girl
# It's essential that you grow amongst your group
# So you don't grow too fast and be doin lord knows who
# Cuz daddy loves you, don't let nobody tell you different
# What I, do for a living is a talent I'm given
# And I'ma raise you too black too strong beautiful
# Tell the truth let you know what women go through
# Lies and deceit, the nigga you love he gone cheat
# So be careful in the heat baby girl wit cold feet
# Keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
# Make me proud you daddy's little baby ha
# I'll always come back to you
# I'll always come back to you
# I'll always come back to you
# You're my baby now and ever
# Yo Ja's imagery is somewhat like God and his chemistry
# Blasphemy, I tell my baby girl proudly
# Put her over my knee and let her know this world is yours
# Men are dogs take it from daddy and hold yours
# Head high lady, love is bout lies and deception
# Will always be seen through the eyes
# In my demise don't cry just, hold on
# Stay headstrong and live to learn that life goes on
# The day you was born God answered my cry for help
# I look at you a female replica of myself
# I was conceived 2/29 you 9/22
# God' whats the science in this sign you threw?
# I wanna know just so I can spread the jewel to my youth
# So she don't have to come up like I did runnin loots
# Keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
# Make me proud you're daddy's little baby
# For real
# When I look in yo eyes I see stars
# It's me and you against the world
# Baby it's in the signs
# And anything you want you can get it daddy's getting it done
# You the reason why I keep the hundreds under the ones
# And go through rain sleet and snow to kiss the sun
# Though my travel through the storm has just begun
# Swear to god when my sister died, I was only five
# Didn't even cry, couldn't know the value of a life
# Know I realize why Brittney's so rare to me
# She came at the time when nobody cared for me
# This world's tough, I'ma guide you through it carefully
# Learn the game and remember nothing in life's free
# My little lady, can't quite understand me now
# But baby, in time I'll break it down
# So keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
# Make me proud you're daddy's little baby
# For real

# Got me seekin capital game when I spit sixteen
# Whether bars or sixteens in the doors of cars
# A star is born
# In the hood, made a name live on, R-U-L-E, ladies, feel me
# [Charli Baltimore]
# Now I'm show you blood or love, there's no belly you bounce from
# Blow sellin, dough amounts to no tellin
# There'll be no tellin, snitches get it back
# Those gats to your backs for my boy
# What part of the game is that, huh?
# Niggas and they feelings 'cause I handle your dealings, keep your name in tact
# My fame's in tact so cops won't know what it's hittin for
# Now hoes wanna know what you shittin for
# 'Cause I'm your bitch, the Bonnie to your Clyde
# It's mental, mash your enemies, we out in the rental
# I'm your bitch, niggas run up on ya, shift ya lungs, who's your organ donor?
# What they know about, extreme meausures I'm a ride with you
# And my baby three-eighty at my side
# And we lock the town, I'm as down as any thug
# My love, they gotta take us in blood, what
# [Ja Rule]
# You could die from love, at any given time I could die from slugs
# But that's what this life is capable of
# The death and the life of a bitch and a thug, is what I'm scared of
# But God up in Heaven who ain't afraid to, tuck the toast in the Escalade
# Pop on niggas that showin me shade, but only for the Rule 'cause that's my baby
# Got me a down ass bitch with red hair, that don't care
# Blazed by the shots and flares
# Girl c'mon, follow me, and bust back at police, conceal ya heat
# It's a bit much to blaze up, Rule and Chuck, N-I-G, the Murderous, I-N-C
# With one on the hip, one in the holster, nigga will toast ya quick
# Especially a down ass bitch
# [Ja Rule]
# Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch
# Thug on, ladies
# Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch
# Thug on, baby
# Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch
# Thug on, ladies
# Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch
# Thug on, baby

# [Ja Rule]
# I got you ma, workin in New York City
# It's Satuday Night Live, and I'm hot so bear with me
# Plus a little tired from the time zone switches

# I get in and get a table, get bottles, some bi***es
# come over, they claimin they models
# Until they want a drink they ain't even know who I was
# Until I took my hat off, and then they started backin that ass up
# Whoa! She did this dance with her hands up
# Then she touched her toes and made my thing stand up
# Type of chick that'll have a nigga in handcuffs
# Taste but don't swallow, look but don't touch
# Forbidden, not to be eaten, but she is
# feedin me rotten apples that fall from the tree
# Why don't we leave, just us three, and get acquainted
# Mama I'm just playin - but I'm sayin
# [Ja Rule]
# I got you ma, I'm in L.A., I'm the latest
# Caught the last flight in from JFK
# Baggage claim sign read R-U-L-E
# Takin me straight to the party so I can get started
# Rubbin on bi***es like full body massages
# And takin dead aim on all open targets
# Soon as I walk in I see the one
# that I wanna be humpin, bouncin, and grindin on
# Her lowrider sit low, you can see her thong
# And she like to get low on her favorite songs
# I'm like don't stop, get it get it, let me get up on it
# Let me see how bad you really want it
# like, them cold nights when you're hot and lonely
# Give me your pager, pick up a phone and call me
# I was thinkin that maybe we could have an orgy
# Mama I'm just playin - but I'm sayin
# [Ja Rule]
# I got you ma, and Miami's the scene
# Filled with fast women when they stop intervene
# Tanned up and their walk is mean
# I don't wonder how she got in, I want her out of them jeans
# It seems, me and my team got a routine habit
# Of gettin rid of sweaters as soon as we snag 'em
# In the club, gettin high, relaxin
# I see a few asses that's pacin backwards my way
# The DJ spinnin it backwards
# Givin shouts to actors, athletes and rappers
# Now, let's get it crackin, you know how it happen
# After the party there's an afterparty happenin
# (Let's get this party started)
# Ain't that what you said, or am I hearin things?
# Is you drunk, cause you look like you swerve in both lanes
# Mama I'm just playin - but I'm sayin

# Dear Lord, can you, feel my pain

# If you can't it's alright, cause I'ma live my life anyway
# Just let, it, rain - on me
# I feel, so free like a, cool breeze
# And when the sun, gon', shine
# Fold up the mini - blinds, load up the lucky 9
# And hit 'em up from behind
# That's, my, life - and it'll never be the same
# Ever again, the game is to blame
# Don't get caught up in your Range Rover, pullin over
# On the Westside highway shoulder, nigga I'll blow ya
# Like a windshield, leave yo' mind on the windshield
# And have yo' whip doin windmills, that's what rain feels
# Like, when it's hittin a little harder than drizzle
# And pickles flyin out pistols, gotta niggaz cryin they Christians and
# I can't believe shit has come to this
# It's unheard of, now it's gonna reign down murder

# I think the rain is comin back
# I think the reign is comin murder
# I think the rain is comin back
# I think the reign is comin murder

# God only breathes with the best of them, bury the rest of them
# A storm is comin, I got a hundred mile runnin head start
# On these niggaz cause it's murder for life
# Drugs, bitches, and money be my only vice
# But I'm livin life in the fast lane, doin the damn thang
# In the Ferrari hard top watchin "Hard Rain"
# It's a damn shame, no more games
# No more love, baby boy I throw back slugs
# Through your Green Bay throwback, I hits that up
# And let you know where the reign is from
# You ever heard of mixin whiskey with Jamaican rum? You get Biggie
# Mix gin with a little cocaine, you got me
# And my style is a little too savage to not be
# Be looked upon as one of the illest to MC
# Y'all niggaz want it with me? That shit's unheard of
# Cause niggaz, now it's gonna reign down murder
# Nobody loves me
# [Ja Rule]
# Sometimes I wish the good Lord would come down and hug me
# I take a look at my life, it's gettin ugly
# And now I know that you all wanna slug me
# I can get above it, it's my life and I dug it
# Even though I live it close to the edge
# I'm gettin closer to death, with eve - rrry little step
# That I take, in the awake of my last days
# I hope the sun shines with a light rain
# That would mean the world shared my pain
# And now the world could be happy again, smile
# Cause if I ever walk "The Green Mile"
# You can look at me and blame it on my lifestyle
# What can I say? I was raised as an only child, lonely
# Poppa didn't show me, so the streets raised me
# To call me crazy is not unheard of
# Now it's gonna reign down murder
# [Chorus - repeat to fade]

# (I never thought)
# That you would fall in love with this side of me first
# (That I'd be)
# Intrigued with the thought of the gift and the curse
# (Without ya)
# And now your heart broke and it's making it worse
# (Why Me, Why Me)
# WHY ME
# (I never thought)
# That you would be involved with a nigga like I
# (That I'd be)
# Scared to look passion right in it's eyes
# (Without ya)
# And when you found love it was nothing but lies
# (Why Me, Why Me)
# Why, who would've thought
# What the f*** is ya hobby mami highway robbery
# cuz u got enough jewelry on ya body to buy a Farari
# i'm like Ruben i'm sorry but I dont studder
# matter fact call me Frank Love cuz i'd love to f*** ya
# she said slow baby dont rush
# I promise if u be patient i'll let u tear it up
# and nigga sho nuff
# we decided to keep in touch with each other u feel me
# I didnt know we'd be touching ??
# i'm surious, and i'm so sincure
# my object is to stay in the clear
# cuz we find f*** and flee these broads round here
# I done made so many women shed so many tears
# sittin home all alone getting drunk off of shots of bathome
# decided to call let her feelings be known
# in a slurred tone, she said I always get what I want
# and what I want is u, but I dont get it cuz...
# Girl our, situation is getting a little out of my hands
# u calling me constant telling bi***es that i'm ya man
# I thought we was just friends conversating
# gettin to know one another on a friendly basis
# lets face it we from two different worlds that dont collide
# but when they do the crash is more like a biz-omb
# your favorite seasons bigati and mines is summer
# u use credit I rubber band wrap my hundreds
# what we got in common is minimal right next to nothin
# and I think that's whats subliminally keepin u comin
# back to the one u been f***in but never thought you'd be f***in
# how often do u think about the awkwardness of it
# I know u love it to say the least
# and I aint just sayin that contrary to some beliefs opposites attract
# and my track record is something to be expected
# money cash hoes u know how it goes
# Who would have thought that something so simple would turn out to be detriminal
# now i'm feeling like i'm caught in the middle
# of this love triangle between she me and reality
# reality is tellin us that we could never be
# cuz I come from the streets and u come from a rich family
# but I dont think that your family would understand me
# it's the little things u overlook when you're around me
# drugs guns bi***es and needless to say
# you're a pimp in your own way
# baby you're makin it hard for me to look in your eyes and tell u to move on
# i'm gone (i'm gone)
# but then i'm back again
# money and good p****'s a fatal attraction for men
# she hits me every night quarter past ten
# and with every call her voice got a little more intense
# now we involved and it really dont make no sense
# so be careful what u ask for u just might get it biaaaatch!

# I never thought (that you would be involved with a nigga like I)

# Why Me? (Why?)

# What the fuck is your hobby mami? highway robbery?
# Cause you got enough jewelrey on your body to buy a Ferari
# I'm like Ruben "I'm Sorry" but I don't stutter
# Matter call me Frank love cause I'll let her fuck ya
# She said "slow baby don't rush, I promise if you be patient
# i'll let you tear it up" and nigga sho nuff
# We decided to keep in touch with each other ya feel me?
# I didnt know that me touchin would lead to her catchin feelings
# I'm Serrious and I'm so Sincerre, my object is to stay in the clear
# Cause we find, fuck then flee these broads round here
# I done made so many women shed so many tears
# Sittin home all alone gettin drunk off of shots of Vedron
# Decided to call let her feelins be known in a slurred tone
# She said "I always get what I want and all I want is you"
# But I don't get it cause
# [Ja Rule]
# Girl our situation is getting a little out of my hands
# You calling me constant tellin bitches that I'm your man
# I thought we was just friends conversating
# Getting to know one another on a friendly basis
# Lets face it, we from two different worlds that don't collide
# But when they do the crash is small like a facad
# Your favorite season is Beghotti and mine is Summer
# You use credit I rubberband wrap my hundreds
# We got in common is minumum right next to nothing
# And I think thats what sumblimaly keeping you coming
# Back to the one you been fuckin but never thought you'd be fuckin
# How often do you think about akwardness of it?
# I know you love it to say the least and I ain't just sayin
# That contrary to some beliefs I present the track
# And my track record is something to be expected
# Money, Cash, Hoes you know how it goes
# [Ja Rule]
# Who would've thought that something so simple
# Would turn out to be dentramental now I'm feeling
# Like I'm caught in the middle of this love triangle
# Between she, me and reality, and reality is telling
# Us that we could never be, cause I come from the streets
# And you come from a rich family, but I don't think that your
# Family would understand me, It's just them little things you overlook
# When you're around me drugs, guns, bitches and needless to say
# You're a pimp in your own way baby you're making it hard
# For me to look you in your eyes and tell you to move on
# I'm Gone (I'm Gone) but then I'm back again
# Money and good pussy is a "Fatal Attraction"
# From then she hits me everynight quarter past 10
# And with every call her voice got a little more tense
# Now we involved and it really don't make no sense
# So be careful what you ask for you just might get it BIOCTH!!!

# Nobody loves me
# Sometimes the world can seem so cold
# Looking through the windows of my soul
# I see, the true fan now I know (I know, I know, I know)
# Y'all gotta love me
# When the weight of the world was on my shoulders
# You were there
# When it got heavy, I held it
# You were there
# The ones that stood by me like soldiers
# You were there
# I know you love me
# [Verse One]
# But I'm still waiting for the Lord to come hug me
# Send a sign or somethin'
# This is all for nothin'
# The talent and Passion of mine
# I'm sick of sufferin'
# I know your plans is greater than mine
# So I'm asking
# Why do you want me dead or alive
# And how could you let the people see me through the enemy's eyes
# Like, jealousy, envy, Feds wanna convict Gotti
# I'm thinking probably we was gettin' too much money
# Too many niggaz in whips sittin' on 20's
# Too much connections to the streets, y'all niggaz doin' somethin'
# And after overall assumptions, or it's all or nothin'
# Ain't nothin' stopping the second coming, except the coffin
# I may be incased, but even from there I still touch 'em
# niggaz ??? ???, that's why we still hustle
# For all my niggaz that can't be here
# For every tear, send my a prayer, I swear
# [Verse Two]
# But what's love, when your friends become enemies
# Your nightmares are no longer your worst dreams
# And as bad as everything seems
# Keep hustling
# We gon' get it by any means
# How unfortunate, January the sixth
# Federal officers, raided our offices
# Making it hard for us to eat, and breathe, and live
# And they swear they got niggaz asking for relief
# They've been handin' down indictments for about a year
# And they send nobody to jail yet, we still in the clear
# And the Bible that said, "Thou shall not fear no man but God"
# Whoever said that, ain't never faced the law
# And why all this fake ??? going on
# I'm fighting niggaz, swingin' back against the wall
# That's for my niggaz that can't be here
# For every tear, send my a prayer, I swear
# [Verse Three]
# How could you hate me, why would the Lord forsake me
# Put the weight of the world on my shoulders
# I thinkin' I could brush it off and nobody notice
# Keep raisin' my kids: Britney, Jeffry, and Jordan
# Keep coppin' new whips: Bentleys, Benzes, and Porshes
# My niggaz, and my fans is the only thing of importance
# It's crazy how the world turns
# Sometimes, you gotta light up and let it burn
# Sweep up your ashes, put 'em up in a urn
# On a mantle from memories
# I hear you callin' me, Lord knows you love me
# The Passion of Rule is so real, just lend me your ear
# You'll feel what I feel, you'll tear when I tear
# The vision's real clear, just look in my eyes
# I believe in putting my life in the hands of God
# For all my niggaz that can't be here
# For every tear, send me a prayer, I swear

# Chorus
# In my race against time
# I can't stop running through the red lights
# Living my life even if i'm getting to hot
# I'm keep running throughthe red lights living my life
# Verse 1
# God why the hell am i here
# Is it a blesssing or a panful lessen of life, or it's direction
# Date of conception 2/29, i was birthed and won't denied
# Look in to these eye's and witness life tragedy
# Boy who made slaves out of men that's me
# For every lock there a key, the only thing that ever made me click was cash
# money
# So what i lust for be it one of my deadly sins
# You know there seven and I got all of them, deep within
# Sometmes I slip but you be there to pick me up
# Now i'm on my knees like what's up
# cause only in a world this corrupt and this sick could you dare
# To look at my life and call it innocent
# Guide me to a better sense cause what's yours is mines
# Hear me Lord i'm running out of time
# Chorus
# Nobody cry for me
# cause I wanna see you smile for me when i die, look through my windows
# To the soul tell me if you see JA living to grow old
# Cause to many people done died for what i hold
# The talent to warm a world which is so cold
# Take me save me before I'm crazy, the only reason I live is for my baby
# Never did you tell me that life ain't a game
# Maykbe if you told me this shit mgiht could change
# But now i'm just racing against time tryin to survie
# And see why yawl niggas striving off a nigga vibe
# If yo going to live know you going to die
# If you're steel know you get to lie
# Get drunk and stay high
# Lead the nickel nine cause they never take me alive
# Hear me lord i'm running out of time
# Chorus
# Verse 3
# I fears no man for when it's time to go i'm gone
# Racing through the darkness learning what's right from wrong
# Looking for the light, but all i see is the night
# When everything is bright what happened to my life
# Is this what i am is this what i become a nigga who don't give a fuck about
# nothin and no one
# And no one cold even though I got a bruning desire within my soul
# I'm a set this whole world on fire
# If i can control my destiny maybe one day i'll give this world the best of me
# You know i never been one to judge right or wrong
# I embraced and showed you love then i throw slugs
# At the other side go get em in broad day light
# What a nigga would give to live my life
# You don't want it cause if you could get it
# you would try fell me Lord Ja has arrived

# Be glad I'm not a pimp, if I was I'd charge ya
# But for all that you go through, just thought I'd let you know
# Hoes need love too, I'm fuckin witchu
# [Chorus: Ja Rule]
# Niggaz need to read the man-u-al
# To seperate your housewife from a hoe
# Cause there's no rules to this shit here
# Am I makin myself clear?
# What she don't know won't hurt her y'all
# So keep big pimpin on the low
# Cause there's no rules to what I do
# And I know, hoes need love too
# [Verse Two]
# You know what they say right?  Bitches ain't shit
# And all men are dogs cause we just wanna fuck
# Sundown to sun up, one up on a hoe
# I might go down on the low, that's just me though
# From L-A-X to Heathrow, I'm one of them niggaz
# that really doesn't need no, introduction
# When I met her she was "Girl, Interrupted"
# Grew up became a woman not to be trusted
# Frustrated and flustered, living amongst
# these thieves hoes and hustlers, I'm diggin what's next
# She had a studio apartment in the projects
# With her and her girl from D.C. used to bus checks
# And hold the coke, her niggaz ain't sold yet
# In hopes the copes don't know about all this
# Shiiiiit, for all that you go through
# Just wanna let you know, hoes need love too
# [Verse Three]
# Fake nails, fake breasts, fake eyes too
# It's oh-four, and that's kinda what we used to
# But you don't holla back like you used to, but I ain't mad at cha
# I'm happy for a bitch, even if I can't have her
# I remember when you was down in Atlanta
# Workin gentlemen's clubs and you didn't even know what a gentlemen was
# Forty to love and I wanna serve
# That body like Serena's with less curves
# But actions speak louder than words, and you gettin your money
# Mami every month, 15th and 1st
# Shit could be worse, you could be in the struggle
# Or born with no ass and have nothin to hustle
# Go on flex your muscle, cause that ain't the case is it?
# Go on get your paper keep flossin on these bitches
# Cause for all that you go through
# Just thought I'd let you know, hoes need love too, I'm fuckin witchu

# I know you miss my lovin', my thuggin'
# Thug lovin'
# And I know you're gettin' bored
# I know you're livin' your life faithfully, safely,

# But you miss bein' next to me, don't you
# Don't let her love haunt you, lust for what you wanted
# Go for your guns and back out on anyone who tries to
# interfere or intervene on me
# Peelin' your wide body out of them tight jeans
# Wrist on freeze, see it's on me
# Shoes 19, comin' through in that new Bentley thing
# From town to town and city to city
# You and I make headlines like Lo and Diddy and Bob and
# Whitney
# It appears the Lord sent me a pound ???
# Real devilish and freak that ***
# Forget the story, I know you're gettin' bored
# And you ain't gettin' horny no more, is he
# 'Cause when it's all said and done, it's me
# Lovin', thuggin' you
# I know you're gettin' bored
# Dealin' with him

# Sweet thing livin' it
# Won't you let me let you live it a little bit
# I know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with
# But ??? had to deal with it
# On your weekly visits
# Use a code name to protect the innocent
# Maybe I'm true generous
# Generally believin' that all women want me
# They don't wanna get even
# But who do you believe in
# Is it money or God
# Betray your trust, sustain your vows
# Secretly or sacred
# 'Cause I love it when you rock your body-body
# Move your body-body
# Rip up on the Bacardi
# And roll up along side me
# I love to see you wild and free
# But occasionally you get cold wet feet
# And all that it means to me is that you need my heat
# 'Cause when it's said and done you're gonna want me
# Lovin', thuggin' you
# I know you're gettin' bored
# Dealin' with him
# I know you miss my lovin', my thuggin'
# Thug lovin'
# And I know you're gettin' bored
# Dealin' with him
# I know you miss my lovin', my thuggin'
# Thug lovin'
# And I know you're gettin' bored
# Baby, here I'm holdin' your love hostage
# The ransom for you, sugar, be priceless
# 'Cause you been gettin' at me in many a ways
# Now tell your man to watch his back and duck them
# strays
# 'Cause I been in a rage lately
# Hopin' God'll forgive me for all the sin and all the
# woman
# All the drama I been in and it's just the beginnin'
# I hope your *** so you could see that n**** ain't
# hooked like me
# ???
# But we one in the same, that's why we get along
# Freak off and get it on
# When we make love lookin' somethin' like soft porno
# Tell me, baby, do you really wanna go home to him
# But the brightest of days just look dim
# When you f***in' with a loser, baby, you can't win
# When it's said and done you're gonna need me
# Lovin', thuggin' you
# I know you're gettin' bored
# Dealin' with him
# I know you miss my lovin', my thuggin'
# Thug lovin'
# And I know you're gettin' bored
# Dealin' with him

# Chorus
# Yeah we here now
# Don't get scared now
# Ja Rule nigga about to tear shit down
# What ya'll thought ya'll was going eat forever
# and my dog wouldn't blaze heat for cheddar
# We better eat together or meet at the cross road
# 'Cause the Lord knows it's murder hold those
# When your casket close and your should rise high
# Remember the dead don't die unless they fuck wit' I
# Verse 1
# Niggas know who don't you shit
# The flow is retched and my gee too futuristic for you hoe's to catch it
# I'm a god send the falling angel and I do sin
# Far from perfection but still considered a gem
# Thank you Lord for given me the wind beneath my wings
# When the miracle spittin there shall be no witnesses
# To the pain and my ignorance, I charge to the game
# So many love and slain by bullets wit dead aim
# I weathered the change
# Stormed through the streets in the range, can't complain
# A nigga live to die in the flames
# Casue i torture J to A the Rule
# Niggas can't be seriously fucking wit me
# What you holla R-U-L-E 'bout, we can hit up an alley and air out
# Bullets exit the barrel, holla enter your month
# That's how i'm built
# Under the floss there nothing but filth
# Don't let it fool you
# I still let these slugs heat up and cool you off forever more
# So help me Lord
# Gonna find a way to my grave just because i'm Mur-der-er, whole not part
# Cut me open, i bleed for the INC from the heart
# When i start it's usually endless
# Pop one with gloves on, make u check with forensic, son
# In your appendix, son, you got hit up, huh, fucking wit Ja you know it's
# murder
# Chorus
# Verse 2
# R-U-L-E spits monotonous
# Hot as apocalypse, now you eying this ferocious mic supremacist
# Whose limit is endless
# This nigga don't risen murderous flows killed suspicion
# Niggas is too light in the ass to be shitting
# Hollis ave, historical nigga respect tradition
# Cause all i see is blooshed and niggas gunning em' down, and you confess
# that i'm so who's touching me now
# Shipped three hundred with a freestyle fucking you up
# And got them hoes in the back rows tossing it up
# i got the touch cause' my flow is bananas, bitches can't stand us
# We ghetto fabulous, aim when i bust and blast on surprise
# If ya'll nigga don't know you need to see me live
# I'm like two 45's spitting in every direction
# ya'll niggas is hoe's in stelleto and thongs, it's a break of a new day
# Maybe you'll get to see vilntly what drives me
# Take em'  back to the gutter, smother the world in filth
# rule's the name and now you're going to see how i'm built, nigga.

# Umm hey, comin from Where I'm From (I'm from) ohhh yea
# [Ja Rule]
# Kids get killed in ghettos, shot up over the car limos

# Shed a tear cause he lost his son the same way a year ago
# It's the same egospiritual, we thuggin in harmony
# They say death brings life, there exchange no robbery
# If I'm wrong pardon me, me I'm just tired of poverty
# Why them niggaz in the hood never hit the lottery
# Unless they go lottery, first round in the draft
# First we dustin off the rounds and we slip in the mag'
# Then we slip on the masks, and go out and mash
# And we call it feeding our family
# Ya'll call it a tragedy, Damn
# How I could just kill a man
# His blood flow like a river and rinse his blood off of my hand
# If you hearing me speak please Lord give me a chance
# Please forgive me of my sins, cause we cleansed where I'm from
# [Chorus - Lloyd]
# Me and my niggaz ride
# Even when the sun don't shine and its cold outside
# I never run in or hide, cause some niggaz hate it
# But I can't get faded cause I done made it
# Instead of struggling or strive
# Survive my weight how these ghetto streets of mine
# This is coming from Where I'm From (I'm from)
# We all walk back in line (yeah)
# [Ja Rule]
# Now everybody know that everybody said nobody can hide from beef
# Except but us, who surprised when these kids get killed on the streets
# Look how these animals eat that's how they talk bout us
# While they shed they joke and laugh puttin a choke round us
# Can I get a moment of SILENCE
# Cause they claimin it's the niggaz that's causin all the violence
# What bout the ones that protect to serve our honor
# Poppin the blue colla', with shots soon to follow
# The ghettos in horror, cause in this boy shot went back
# And now the neighborhood hot and he can't move the crack
# When it's all about the dollars
# And he'll individually get murdered cause money is power
# But then these snitch's get to talking and it's colder than ours
# Cuffed and crimed on the bus heading straight to the Island
# He was only 13, but tried us in the dope and as high as the coast
# Cause ain't no more children in the ghetto where I'm from
# [Ja Rule]
# We ain't all killers in prison
# Matter fact that's a stereo typical thought of livin
# Cause they don't know about the hood and them love in it
# Summer time top down with the wood finish
# Pushin hard uptown windows slightly tinted
# Back to back Benz and jeeps, blowin weed with my niggaz
# On our way to a house party, gonna f*** with some bi***s
# Let's get some liquor for shorty who said she make us some chicken
# And if we get 'em drunk enough we probably could freak em, and do it every
# other weekend
# If I don't have to kill niggaz, I never would leave the ghetto
# I'm like an angel that put on a halo, cradle the grave of my niggaz that we
# lost in the ghetto
# Cause where I'm from in the ghetto we rock white tee's and nike's
# Roll 3 dice and name our dope ice cream
# Set trends and ya'll follow our lead
# But in New Yitti niggaz follow they dreams, where I'm from
# Now I lay me down and sleep
# And I pray to the Lord, for my soul to keep
# If I should die before I wake
# Pray to the Lord, for my soul to take (Pray to the Lord, for my soul to take)

# Out from underneath your feet
# We could shake it off
# Instead we'll plant some seeds
# We'll watch em' as they grow
# And with each new beat
# From your heart the roots grow deeper
# The branches will they reach for what
# Nobody really knows
# But underneath it all
# Theres this heart all alone
# What about is gone
# And it really won't be so long
# Sometimes it feels like a heart is no place to be singin' from at all
# Theres a world we've never seen
# Theres still hope between the dreams
# The weight of it all
# Could blow away with a breeze
# If your waiting on the wind
# Don't forget to breathe
# Cause as the darkness gets deeper
# We'll be sinkin as we reach for love

# Well I'm just a girl  that's trying to stay a float
# Trying to make it out of this struggle no scars
# It's hard real hard baby you just got to do
# What you got to do, do what you got to do
# My old girl gave me strength and she raised me well
# She said don't hold in you got to write about this hell
# Well momma you had a born winner and I ain't crazy
# I'm a survivor hell I'm a 80's baby
# The streets raised me
# A bitch don't get no rougher then that
# Liberty City? It don't get no tougher then that
# Don't get it twisted I'm from the hood
# I'm a fortunate girl
# I see more money then them bitches in the corporate world
# Kick in the cloey party in prada, shop at the harbor?
# I'm a booster bitch, why bother?
# I love the way my weed blow in the ghetto breeze
# I'm in Miami where I live it ain't no palm tree's
# Niggaz be on the block with work they got from the dock
# We Flintsone kids we surrounded by bricks and rocks
# And my thugs don't give a fuck about catching a case
# We bring them stacks back I-95 and they exit on 8
# (Hook-  O'Damia)
# I'm addicted to this ghetto world
# (survive in these streets)
# It's hard on a ghetto girl

# What am I gonna do? When this is the life I choose
# This nigga put me down but he started to change
# He put the chevy up nigga went and cop the range
# Tucking in his shit then he started talking funny
# But I say I'm a gutter bitch and I won't change for money
# I ain't a little girl I'm out here on my own
# And the decisions I made they turnt me to a woman
# The booze the bars the jumping into dudes cars
# Fights with broads the life of a ghetto star
# I could be lamping on ripplekey? I done seen the stacks
# But I be in U.S.A getting my weed stacked
# If that's chanel I'm rocking maybe a topic
# Of a bitch conversation in the latest street gossip
# So be it I don't even see it
# I just breeze through the hood
# Blow tree's and I'm good
# The box of shifty I'm linking bout fifty
# My gutter bitches get me vibe and sing with me

# It's been so bad to fast walking the streets
# Auction for half the cost we got it for free
# That's how we eat showing love breaking tips off
# Making ends meat with that instant credit rips off
# We love the streets ain't nothing out of reach
# We play hard and be strong the struggle won't be long
# As I open up my window to a new day
# The sun shine but the skies are still gray
# All the scars I bare I'm glad God is there
# Aint no complaints it's hard but it's fair
# I ain't laying down even when it's trouble
# It ain't nothing I just keep me a hustle
# I roll through the beams then through the scotts
# Enjoying my hood and listening to pac
# I remember not to let it control me
# I just keep my head up and I won't let it fold me

# Out from my window, the people are passing on by

# And the lights down on Main Street donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t shine like they used to
# And IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m thinking of nothing but spending a lifetime with you
# You know that I love you, you know that I wait by your door

# Now I got a friend of a friend who drives a nice car
# And I got acquaintances down at the neighborhood bar
# And I got some women; they stop on by my home
# But somehow I always wake up each morning alone
# And the train that I ride has nothing aside
# From the Phantom Conductor with a dog at his side
# And the ghost of a weeping, weddingless bride
# Who should have been married but never arrived
# And I see through the windows like I see through the lies
# Like I see through every useless disguise that
# Everyone wears but everyone swears that they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t
# Ah but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind me baby, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m only dying slow

# Any day now, the jukebox could drive me insane
# ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an old man in the corner that nobody knows
# He says: Ã¢â‚¬Å“laugh while you can cause someday youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be wearing my clothesÃ¢â‚¬?

# And I ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t no prophet, my landlord he told me so
# But my mind is a burning ring of Saturn FlameÃ¢â‚¬Â¦
# And I feel things inside that I just cant explain
# I know that you know how to fake and to take what
# You break what you burn what you never did learn
# Then you turn and you say that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made a mistake
# As your head starts to spin and your heart starts to ache
# But all that you make will be all that you get
# When the curtain goes down, but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you forget
# That all your regret is a cheap silhouette and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s allÃ¢â‚¬Â¦
# Ah but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind me baby, i'm only dying slow

# She was a young girl with a fair heart,
# he could tell it was Heaven, by the way she moved
# but he aint nothing but a spare part
# the boy ain't broken, but boy's been bruised
# and ain't it funny when you're young you live forever
# but forever ain't never enough time
# and ain't it just like that old, lonely feeling
# as the train disapears down the line
# time after time, i ask myself why that it's always
# sad to say goodbye
# now i know a man who lives in Texas
# makes his living working on cars
# he was young and he was restless
# did his fishing in out of town bars
# but on the weekend, he's the one they look at
# all the women know him by name
# but it don't matter cause when the moon meets the morning
# the feeling is always the same
# time after time, i ask myself why that it's always
# sad to say goodbye
# somewhere a mother is drinking
# somewhere a father has lost his good son
# somewhere a sister is thinking
# thinking about what her brother has done
# and nobody's perfect, yet they both blame each other
# and neither can hold back the tears
# ain't it a shame, to see your boy dressed in numbers?
# in numbers for 99 years
# time after time, i ask myself why that it's always
# sad to say goodbye

# ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got to be another one like her
# Floating around in this big bad world
# IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve hoped and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve prayed, let my life slip away
# Like the train that tool my Santa Fe GirlÃ¢â‚¬Â¦
# Well, I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind the roof when it rains,
# But all these soldiers are dragging their chains
# You see, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m alive and alone and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m touched
# By the angel that planted her seed in my veinsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦
# So Lord where is the woman you sent me?
# IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d trade all my freedom just to see her again.
# Send me a postcard from the hotel sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sleeping in,
# IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d love her until the Amen,
# I could love her until the Amen.
# I wish I was home in her kitchen, her pantry
# But IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m hanginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ round with Hangover Jim
# Under my bed all the letters remind me
# IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never be now what I never was then
# SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Santa Fe Girl, a giver a taker
# SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s living for nothing and wasting her time
# SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lover a fighter a blue-eyed heart breaker
# SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s locked up her heart and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s keeping mine
# So Lord where is the woman you sent me?
# IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d trade all my freedom just to see her again.
# Send me a postcard from the hotel sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sleeping in,
# IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d love her until the Amen,
# I could love her until the Amen.
# ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got to be another one like her
# Floating around in this big bad world
# If dreams were like horses and wishes were cab fare;
# IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ride them away to my Santa Fe Girl

# Well I woke up Wednesday morning with bad weather in my brain,
# I lay awake awhile ignoring all the rain
# Now everybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ about who they plan to be,
# EverybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, everybody except meÃ¢â‚¬Â¦
# And no one cares about your heartache or which lonely town youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re from;
# You got to take your salvation boy, however it may come
# And I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but think about what I done wrong
# To deserve this a roaminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ this a travelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ song
# Now I got a little money and I got a little time,
# I got myself a pickup truck that I can call mine
# I got myself a guitar and I got myself some friends
# Some folks say IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m lucky, but I think it all dependsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦
# On the lens that you are looking through and the music that you hear;
# Cause sometimes you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recognize your own face in the mirror
# And I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but think about what I done wrong
# To deserve this a roaminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ this a travelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ song
# Out here on the highway, everythingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so slow,
# I thought I knew my way home, but now I just donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know
# IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going down the road with all them Easter Winds a blowinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢
# IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going down the road and I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s goingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦
# So one more cup of coffee and the radio is on;
# And IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll slip out your door to the breaking of dawn
# And I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but think about what I done wrong
# To deserve this a roaminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ this a travelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ song

# Cigarettes are burning down to my fingers
# in my motel, where the smell still lingers
# from the night before...
# with a ten dollar w**** who didn't even know my name
# the TV says nothing, nothing to me
# and i feel so low in the highest degree
# like a tree with no root, like a gun that don't shoot
# like a dog outside on a chain
# and theres no use for me to sit here an moan
# many a man has been more alone
# and i might feel better if i write a letter
# if i write a letter home
# yeah i heard the news bout' that ol gang of mine
# they're all getting married, they're all doing fine
# they're all getting older, and needin' a shoulder
# that's easy to lean on...
# but as for me, i'm half way to Denver
# how long has it been? I just can't remember
# it all starts to fade, cause' the life that i've made
# is the life that i dream on...
# and there's no use for me to sit here and moan
# many a man has been more alone
# and i might feel better if i write a letter
# if i write a letter home
# now i can't help but to be who i am
# though i've let many women slip from my hands;
# i've let them all go, why? i don't know,
# it just made me feel like a man
# but what i know now, though it may be too late
# you've got to love someone and let go the weight
# you've got to make do when you find love that's true
# this now i understand...
# and theres no use for me to sit here and moan
# many a man has been more alone
# but i might feel better if i write a letter
# if i write a letter home

# The wind still blowin. Summer Sun still glowin.
# And the kids still laugh as they play all day.
# I met a real fine lady. She a right-on-time baby.
# But it's a little complicated 'cause she's just not you.
# So I gotta say
# Someone tell me why even the stars up in the sky conspire to shine.
# They're on your side...
# I'm having a shady day.
# [verse 2]
# I had a long hard workday and even though it's Friday
# I don't wanna go out. I'm here thinking bout you.
# Everything's blas頢las鮠I don't even wanna watch the TV.
# I'm just sit at home thinking ?bout how we used to do.
# [chorus 2]
# Someone tell me why even the stars up in the sky conspire to shine...
# They're on your side...
# I'm having a shady day.
# Your love should be a crime
# The way that it just car-jacked my mind.
# I've over here just passing time.
# I think it's a shady day.
# Dream about her sitting in my ride
# Dream about her laying by my side
# Dream about her sharing those sweet dreams
# As we sit and watch the sunrise
# It was my fault
# The way that I act
# That's a fact
# And now she won't come back
# Oh Lord, I would do anything to have her back with me

# That makes things worst
# Now he's just breathing he can barely manage
# And he's way past starvin
# He's really famished
# His right-hand man is up north, that's hurtin em
# His cellphone bout to cut off, spring jerkin em
# And his baby moms startin to do her thing again
# She left him for a nigga pumpin e up in Bengaltin
# If his money is right than maybe he can diss her
# But he can't, and niggaz is breakin his little sister
# His pops just past
# His mom use to be an occasional sniffer
# Then she started fuckin with the gas
# Dude use to be a star back then
# He had the benz CL something
# But he just turned his car back in
# Mad carrots pawned all his rings
# Took this thing next thing I know
# Money pawned all his bling
# Now he just like everybody
# With the same old plans
# That can't get over the hump
# With the same old grams
# They was on the block making fun of him
# He slid off came back with his hammer and killed everyone of em
# Cause when I come through clear it out
# Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
# When I come through clear it out
# Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
# When I come through clear it out
# Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
# When I come through clear it out
# Play the sideline and observe

# I know niggaz with an asshole
# Full of parole that go hand in hand
# Fuck hot thats humidity
# And you can't mix money with stupidity
# Even though I get my coke from Columbia
# My cars from Germany
# And my guns from Sicily
# Nothin personal but I was raised different
# Hold my joint sideways so I blaze different
# Give it to anybody fuck an age difference
# From those in the world to those in the ca****
# Rub the kite on your chest and swallow the stamp
# At the end of the day they still gonna follow the champ
# It ain't about being lyrical
# Cause when I get in the booth
# I make miracles and I ain't stared at you
# But I'm in tune with the hood so I'm better than you
# And when you see me comin you know what is better to do
# Can't lie all I got is my balls and my vocals
# And the only security I roll wit is my social
# It don't look decent
# It's like niggaz left they crew in the hood
# And went on the rode with the presint
# Had it up to here with this fake shit
# They don't even want a nigga to earn his
# Just give and take shit
# Just make sure you mention my name in da top brackets
# And make sure you mention your name as the top faggot
# Trust me this go around I will not have it
# I putin niggaz heads to bed like crapmadics
# How you think your man died
# More money than respect
# And it wasn't close it was by a landslide
# Listen my nigga your work is sloppy
# And I don't love them hoes but the purple got me
# If I don't don't do it with music I'ma do it wit poppy
# Just play the sideline and observe and watch me

# Yeah, yo, I'm the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
# Mother of pearl delivery, voice of God
# And...it's hard just being the boss
# Being I can't go to jail cause them years'll cost me
# Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
# Rather just sit back and roll a dutch
# Think how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
# Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over Customs
# Never underestimate niggaz, or over trust them
# Uh...yeah them M's is right in my face
# I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
# If it don't jam, the Tech will spray
# When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
# Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
# I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't escape the devil
# Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what
# [Chorus: Nate Dogg]
# The time to talk is up
# So bring the heat, that time is over
# While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
# A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
# Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground
# I know how to get my pairs off me
# They can cry and die from high blood pressure cause tears are salty
# It's a symptom if you bobbin your head
# Know that he's sick, know the flow is ridic', now throw him a grip
# When I get it, you already know I'm throwin them bricks
# Puttin purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwin them nicks
# That's right, homey, you can't move me
# I ain't goin nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies
# All you shootin is the breeze, a bootleg uzi
# I'm just waitin on a que like Suzie, don't lose me
# These penitentiary chances that I take
# Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
# But I invest my bread into something else
# Into something else that'll make something melt
# You just gotta feel the kid
# if not rap for the fact of how real he is, whatever
# Aiyo, niggaz know the champ is in here
# He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
# And I just wanna rock for a century
# Then chase the book with the documentary
# If you, can't do nothin other than flow
# Life's a bitch like the mother from +Blow+, let's go
# Don't make me put your heart in your lap
# Fuck ridin the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track
# Hop out lookin crispy, fresh and new
# In the six, but it's a BM, and it's Pepsi blue
# And, I don't know you.

# Motherfuckin niggas is back, Jada and P
# We got water, (X, haze)

# and be the same old niggas that ratted
# [Who cares?] Talkin 'bout how we hawk niggas in they fuckin back
# Gun works official but niggas don't be wantin that
# Cuz they puss and they mans is lame
# We so for real in the hood we make candy rain
# I could easily send you to God
# But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel I might give you a job
# If you can't remember the name
# All you gotta do is ask the dame for the niggas that deliver it hard...
# Ja- da- mwa, I'll kiss you you bitch ass nigga
# That the hood won't miss you you bitch ass nigga
# Might find your man dead in the ocean
# He be aight though
# You know dead rappers get better promotion
# Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
# Never say you can't do it til you try it first
# Be the young niggas eager to pull it
# but it's a message in everything trust me, even a bullet
# Go to war with the eight and the pound
# Think you got your ear to the street now, put your face in the ground
# Cuz my shells is expensive
# You'll know exactly why when you yellin in intensive
# my fellas is offensive
# Lucky cuz I got guns that crack your back
# but that's not what I prefer I manufacture crack
# and, niggas turn bitch when you show 'em the steel
# but we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal
# I'm comfortable far from home
# Eatin right, gettin good rest either on the far or the foam
# I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
# Sound anything like Kiss then sign right here

# The determination and dedication of disipline
# Listenin and catchin the jewels you was missin
# And they still doin coward sh**
# You know the hate is gonna always be heavy but the love over powers it
# Somethin in the air but the older they get,

# Anytime you can pay us a visit

# It’s real funny baby
# How one day everything’s all good
# and then the next
# Your world comes crumbling down
# Well it’s funny how, it’s funny how
# rain drops they fall (they fall)
# Everything’s right
# It’s funny how
# everything goes wrong (go wrong)
# You’ll be a friend
# It’s funny how
# everyone’s gone (they’re gone)
# It’s funny how, it’s funny how
# Not to long ago, when I need you
# You were nowhere, I couldn’t find you
# but now you want me, I don’t wanna
# be nowhere that you can see me
# So if you ever come my way
# turn and walk away
# It’s funny how, it’s funny how
# rain drops they fall (they fall)
# Everything’s right
# It’s funny how
# everything goes wrong (go wrong)
# You’ll be a friend
# It’s funny how
# everyone’s gone (they’re gone)
# It’s funny how, it’s funny how
# See you always so dear to me
# but then things change
# You shade away
# I need to know why they changed
# and why they couldn’t stay the same
# Somebody take away the rain and
# give me back my sunny days
# It’s funny how, it’s funny how
# rain drops they fall (they fall)
# Everything’s right
# It’s funny how
# everything goes wrong (go wrong)
# You’ll be a friend
# It’s funny how
# everyone’s gone (their gone)
# It’s funny how, it’s funny how
# It’s funny how
# when you need your friends their gone
# It’s funny how suddenly things turned wrong
# It’s funny how, it’s funny how
# Things never go your way
# It’s funny how, it’s funny how
# rain drops they fall (they fall)
# Everything’s right
# It’s funny how
# everything goes wrong (go wrong)
# You’ll be a friend
# It’s funny how

# I remember, I remember when it just wasn't like this
# I remember when we was hungry and we wasn't riding down sixth
# I remember when we didn't have s**t still at it trying to make the best of it
# I remember baby I remember
# (TQ)
# I was a lonely boy and nothin to do but hustle up on my block
# I was the only boy and I still had it in me that I was never gonna stop
# Be up on the bus stop baby working for the new white Jordans
# Dogg I mean I didn't have nothin and thats the way it was, the way it was
# Now a whole lot s**t different all around the world I ball
# Candy coated drop top Lexus, Hot Boy for all of y'all
# And my neighborhood still the same it's never gonna change
# So much love filled with pain
# And I will always remember when I . . .
# (Chorus)
# (Brandon)
# (from Jagged Edge)
# Always had somebody my brother was my dad cuz he was closest to me
# I've never been to lonely and I know what it's like when you lose something
# to eat
# Got bread but no meat, flakes but no milk, clothes but no silk
# And I remember when this life just used to be ugly
# Now things are a little different now all around the world we ball
# Candy coated drop top Lexus, Hot Boy for all of y'all
# And my neighborhood still the same never gonna change
# So much love filled with pain
# And I will always remember when I . . .
# (Chorus)
# (TQ & Brandon)
# Thats why I'm thankful for what I got cuz Lord knows some never get a shot
# Sometimes I wonder when I'm gonna pop but if I never then I long for what I
# got
# Thats why I'm thankful for what I got cuz Lord knows some never get a shot
# And I know how cruel it can be thats why I remember . . .

# This song goes out to everybody
# Who had somebody and you knew they was right
# But some kind of way, you messed up anyhow
# I remember when we first met
# You said you wanted everything
# I tried my best to make it happen but
# What you said you didn't mean
# Now the tables turned
# You feel like your bridge is burned
# I just tried to be a man babe
# You know you did the wrong thing girl
# You don't understand me
# I don't think you heard me
# (I realized, I can't take the pain)
# You know you hurt me bad baby
# (But now I see, and now I know)
# Now I see you really wasn't ready for me
# You can't handle a true man
# One who really, really wants to be
# You can't handle a true man
# Girl I give you my cream and everything
# You can't handle a true man
# One who really wants you to understand
# You can't handle a true man
# Said I gave you all my lovin' babe, anytime you want it babe
# I tried my best to give you right girl
# But you act like you don't like it
# Now I see that we weren't meant to be
# Even though I thought that you were made for me
# Here I go again, it feels like a lonely sin, that I made
# How ya just let me go baby
# And it truly, really hurts so bad
# And why you wanna make me so sad?
# (I realized, I can't take the pain)
# Ooh why did ya hurt me so bad?
# (But now I see, and now I know)
# And now I know you wasn't ready baby you can't handle it
# You can't handle a true man
# One who really, really wants to be
# You can't handle a true man
# Girl I give you my cream and everythin
# You can't handle a true man
# One who really wants you to understand
# You can't handle a true man
# Said I gave you all my lovin' babe, anytime you want it babe
# Yeah, know when I first saw you girl
# I truly thought you were the one for me
# And one day you finally made me see baby
# Too bad you couldn't handle
# All that I had in store
# Messed it up the first time and now you want some more
# Wanting what you like and you ruined my life
# And now you wanna make it right
# You can't handle a true man
# One who really, really wants to be
# You can't handle a true man
# Girl I give you my cream and everything
# You can't handle a true man
# One who really wants you to understand
# You can't handle a true man
# Said I gave you all my lovin' babe, anytime you want it babe
# I got a true love baby, I need a true love
# Someone treat me right
# I don't wanna fuss and fight
# Give me true love baby, I need a true love
# You can't handle a true man
# I got a true love baby, I need a true love
# Someone treat me right
# I don't wanna fuss and fight
# Give me true love baby, I need a true love

# Young cat got back, did a little dig
# Might be hearty, but he tough, doo rag and Timbs
# Kinda hard to get a job back out on the block
# Charge that to the game
# Young girl she grew in a rush
# Had it bad, no doubt, she don't know who to trust
# Every man she ever loved only want to touch
# Charge that to the game
# But it's all gravy, baby
# Shots gettin' popped, the cops shut down the party
# Jeans sag low, blow smoke out of Dutches
# We've got love for ya'll who sure don't know us
# So we swerve in the Suburban switchin' lanes
# Spend up all our dough on them chrome and thangs
# Name our kids some funny names
# Don't hate on us, we're fabulous
# We pay cellulars for local calls
# Hatin' kinds of demons up at the malls
# ???, that's how we roll
# But don't hate on us, we're fabulous
# They met, he said how she was a dime
# So naive that she believed every single line
# 17, first time slipped up, 'bout to have a child
# Charge that to the game
# Was just us and mom, single family home
# She did the best she could, did it all her own
# Met a man but he won't raise a child that's not his own
# Oh, no, oh, no, no
# But it's all gravy, baby
# Shots gettin' popped, the cops shut down the party
# Jeans sag low, blow smoke out of Dutches

# So come on, come on
# Do you really want my arms
# So you can hold- my hand
# Take the skin off of my back
# Take the feet from under me
# So you can- stand
# Take in all the people I like
# Break in all my sunny skies
# And I will take all of your rain
# For the ones you hate

# Silently I scream
# Inside I
# Barely breathe
# Silently I scream
# Reflection overzone
# It'll never be the same
# Restless and jaded, I
# Still
# Still I've changed
# Do you feel
# Naive
# Did you make me believe
# Were you
# Decieved
# Oh you fell right on your knees
# Oh I'm playing you for a fool
# You fell for every broken rule
# I'm doing what I owe to you
# It's been a long time coming
# And I'm coming for you

# I've changed
# You've got it going on
# No way I'll let you stay
# You've got it goin on
# I don't want to see your face
# It's taken all this time
# Before
# I realized that I
# Should go
# Because I told you so I
# Could let it go
# Without a fight
# It might not be right
# Reflection overzone
# It'll never be the same

> Jakalope
# Oh...
# I'm chasing defeat
# Self created- misery
# Where will this end
# Where did it begin
# I won't lie down
# I'm already- down
# I rest my step and fall
# Into the hole
# (Chorus)
# I've closed my eyes
# Not even the start
# To rest my head- so far
# Nothing, nowhere but emptiness
# Oh...
# Tears of dust burn me
# I'm so tired- and weary
# I've put my feet down
# Firmly- on the ground
# There's no way to overcome
# What I've- done
# I've missed my step and lost all control
# (Chorus)
# Oh, oh
> Jakalope
# Tracin' the steps that I take
# Feelin' mistakes that are fake
# Makin' excuses like imaginary friends run away
# To where I've already been
# To where I already am
# So tell me tell me it'll work out so I'll be 'round again
# I look inside I'm surprised at what I see in my eyes
# So tell me tell me was I there when I was taught how to lie?
# I thought I'd chase paradise but Ill just set off a lie
# So tell me tell me did I die when I was taught how to lie?
# Don't tell me what it'll be because it's all in degrees
# And by degrees what I mean is you dont see what I see
# So is this falling apart or are these pieces of me?
# Is this a nightmare to be or am I building a dream?
# When did this come to be?
# When did things pick up speed?
# Tiein' down my living needs
# Tiein' down my living needs
# Oh ohh
# Don't know why (don't know why)
# Don't know why (don't know why)
# Don't know why I am here
# All that I've forgotten is only stoppin to remind me
# Only I (Only I)
# Know that I (Know that I)
# Only I can be my only
# Odd sacrifice
# I suffered twice and all that I did
# Was beleive..
# Its funny how life can be the circles dance around me
# Drawing a reminder of what I've done and who I've become
# Sleepin' my days without dreams, Wakin' a night without sleep
# Missing the truth to lie the promises I heard I would keep
# Im lost in my paradise, the walls have built in my life
# So tell me tell me will I die if I forget how to lie?
# When did this come to be?
# When did things pick up speed?
# Tiein' down my living needs
# Tiein' down my living needs
# Oh ohh
# Don't know why (Don't know why)
# Don't know why (Don't know why)

# Crossed the Mississippi

# Winding through the Ozarks half a day
# Spend the night in Tulsa
# But hardly slept at all
# A cup of coffee and I was on my way
# Arizona's on my mind
# I really miss her in the morning
# Everyday I wake to find
# Sweet Arizona on my mind
# Stopped in Amarillo
# Long enough to stretch my legs
# Filled my truck and got back on the road
# A friend in Albuquerque
# Said why don't you hang around
# I said sorry son but I have to go
# Can I take a rain check on New Mexico

# I can see her there
# Waiting for me there
# Always calling me back home

# I thought I heard your voice today humming down the hall
# But it was only Janine in 215 just blame it on these paper-thin walls
# Was sure I saw you drive away from Harvey's wash and wax
# That used to be your Tuesday place to shine up that old Pontiac
# And I see
# Signs of you everywhere
# Surrounding me but I don't care
# Since you found someone new
# Looking back's all I've got to look forward to
# Wherever I go you're there
# I see signs of you everywhere
# Everywhere
# Times like these when the leaves are changing the sky is crystal blue
# Just like your eyes that were so amazing I can't help but think of you
# And when I turn out the lights at night and try to get some sleep
# The shadows take on the shape of you dancing round in your bare feet
# And I see
# Chorus….
# I talk to friends we hung out with somebody says your name
# I swear my heart just stops for a second I guess there's no escape
# Cause I see

# ummmmm, yeah ah yeah yeah
# Never ever, in a million years
# Was this what, I was thinking of
# Crazy, some how it never crossed my mind
# My first friend becoming my first love
# Used to be the one who play with my toys an
# Never would of thought of you as a boyfriend
# If you'd asked who I was looking for,
# I would have said someone like the boy next door
# Growing up if you had ever told me,
# You'd be the one I'd be wanting to hold me
# I would have laughed and said you were crazy
# Never be with the boy next door
# So hold you, showed you, everthing in my life
# When we go cruising in your ride
# So why, was I taken by suprise
# Found love growing in my own backyard
# Playing hide an seek
# In the summer heat
# Didn't wanted to go inside
# Wanna hang out until sunrise
# Whenever I was down, never had a doubt
# You wouldn't be in my life
# Whenever anyone saw me, they saw you too
# Used to be the one who play with my toys an
# Never would of thought of you as a boyfriend
# If you'd asked who I was looking for,
# I would have said someone like the boy next door
# Growing up if you had ever told me,
# You'd be the one I'd be wanting to hold me
# I would have laughed and said you were crazy
# Never be with the boy next door

# Took tips from Diddy, switch my committee
# Now some a ya'll can't believe 'how raw is she?'
# Now I'm in da drivers seat getting ya dizzy
# Got ya tongue tied and ya eyes wide
# I even heard a bubbling up in ya inside
# When you swallowed ya pride
# Truth can't be denied
# I know you're probably expecting a ballad
# But I can kick a rhyme round
# Like I'm tossing a salad
# Because this time round I be causing a hazard
# Like if I threw a house party up in Buckingham Palace
# I know you're catching your breath
# On the floor, getting raw, cos it's hot to death
# I come to violate your space like you're under arrest
# And girls - what's a little bit of mud on ya dress?
# We can be all cute, all sweet, and flirty flirty

# So, tell me why you're acting like you been KO-ed?
# It's really not your fault
# You never thought that I could flow though
# Roll though, heat the place up like jalapeáos
# Light up ya life like I was day glo
# I make you feel good like I was a gigolo
# Hypno-tise ya eyes wid my figure, yo
# Disbelieving people convinced I'm digital
# Ain't no shame, they just not familiar wid original
# WOAH
# Ain't run of the mill
# Just one of a mill-ion styles
# That'll just kill you like Amytiville
# Head down always writing, I'll be damned if I chill
# While my names up in lights, and I'm topping the bill
# Ooh slow down girl
# What you mean slow down?
# I'm on a roll now, my dirty-ism's outta control now
# I couldn't even tell myself to hold it down now
# We can be all cute, all sweet, and flirty flirty
# But won't hesitate to get dirty dirty

# Would come your way, from J A M E L I A
# You don't want me to leave now, begging me to stay
# You love the way I got you b-bouncing all day
# I know some of these girls wanna trip me up
# Wanna see me slip up
# Cos their man wanna (slurp) me up
# Gripping his arm like you're holding him up
# Like that's gonna stop him wanting me so much
# I'm like tips in his cup, look at you
# You need a couple nips and a tuck
# Plus a comb and a brush
# You need someone to drag your ass home in a rush
# Standing up in here like you're looking so plush
# Your mamma shoulda named you what the
# Okay, okay, alright, alright
# I got it man, you don't have to alert me
# There's times in my life when I just gotta get dirrty!

# Declaring your undying love
# So poetically
# But it wasn't written for me
# So I guess I wasn't supposed to see
# Although last night you were loving me
# Wanting to spend your life with me
# Why couldn't you just talk to me
# And say, “J, you're not the one”
# Instead a F-ing wid my head
# And now I want you dead
# No matter what the consequence
# Said I'm bout to do life for you
# Got this live or die love for you
# And I swear if I can't have you
# Then nobody will, nobody will
# I'm prepared to do life for you
# Put my ass on death row for you

# Baby what does she do that I don't?
# Only one thing I can think of
# She's w**** and will go where I won't
# Tell me why do I
# Stand here with this ring on my finger
# Is it nothing but you're just another confused
# *@!X$* How could you lead me on?

# So long, Jimmy, so long.
# Though you only stayed a moment,
# We all know that you're the one. Singing,
# So long, Jimmy, so long.
# Sure we're glad for the experience,
# We miss you now you've gone.
# We're just swimming in your soul 'cause,
# We all wish we wrote this song.
# Life goes on.

# How I wish I could surrender my soul;
# Shed the clothes that become my skin;
# See the liar that burns within my needing.
# How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold.
# How I wish I had screamed out loud,
# Instead I've found no meaning.
# I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
# All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.
# Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
# I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
# It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain.
# How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind;
# Hold memory close at hand,
# Help me understand the years.
# How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.
# How I wish I would save my soul.
# I'm so cold from fear.
# I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
# All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.
# Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
# I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
# Far, far away; find comfort in pain.
# All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.
# It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain.
# Tears and Rain.
# Tears and Rain.
# Far, far away; find comfort in pain,
# All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.
# It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain.

# Makes no difference if i look like a nut
# Every kid in the world is going to copy my haircut
# I'll advertise some trainers, maybe even a car
# Shrewd product placement will gurantee I'm a star
# An ugly guy will write my songs
# Surley there is nothing wrong
# Retiring when I'm 22
# With a house a car and nothing to do
# Instantaneous satisfaction it will be
# Got no need for artistic credibility
# With this attitude I'm bound to go far
# My God! I want to be a popstar!
# Where's the middle ground?
# It's hard to make a living with you own true sound
# What road am I going to tread?
# What the hell would i do instead?
# There may be no tours in Roma, or drug-induced designer coma
# No teenage girls when show is over, I prefer my women older
# Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about

# And wants no part of it at all
# And as the weeping leaves of Autumn curl
# He feels the savage winter call
# See far below the dust of conflict settles on the hill
# Where there was no escape before
# And as he spreads his wings and soars up to another level
# He brings the icy prophecies of war
# Black crow, black crow, tell me where you really go
# When you fly into the sunset, high in evening sky,
# Black crow, black crow, tell me what you really know
# Will we flourish in this hurricane, or will we fall and die?
# While children lose their souls and so much more
# To ragged armies of the field
# A vicious fanfare cries appeasing hungry savages
# To trigger that their fate is surely sealed
# I wonder if that black crow sleeps as day beckons the night
# Or if he even sleeps at all
# I wonder what he thinks of all the human traffic passing far below

# Ni mi več do smeha
# Ujeta v zanko greha ...
# K tebi vleče me
# Ni mi več do tega
# Me ta misel bega ...
# Stran odrivam te
# Ujeta v past, ne najdem poti ...
# Slep labirint narisal si mi ...
# Sladek je greh, grenak je nasmeh
# Jz brez tebe sm na tleh ...
# S tabo letim, s tabo živim ...
# Hočm te, a se bojim ...
# A slišiš moj krik, a čutš utrip ...
# Glas srca ti govori ...
# Jz te hočm, jz te rabm ...
# Le dotik, daj sprejmi moj namig
# Kje si kličem te, dej poišči me ...
# In pobegni z mano ... v ta NORI SVET
# Spet se to dogaja
# Me srce zavaja ...
# K tebi vleče me
# Vem več nisem ista
# Več ne najdem bistva ...
# Stran odrivam te

# Hurt so many times before
# I used to cry but no more
# Let it go and life can feel
# So good
# Stop lying the blues
# Can’t let that petty attitude
# Start to jade my point of view
# Only thing that does is bring me down
# So I’m
# I’m botu to change my vibe
# Today the sun’s gonna shine
# Cause I made up my mind
# That today will be the start of better days
# Leavin old shit behind
# And move on with my life
# The blindfold’s off my eyes
# And now all I see for me is better days
> Janet Jackson
# All the lonely nights i spend alone
# Never 'round to love me
# You're always gone
# 'cause you're hangin' out
# Breakin' the rules
# Oh the man has come
# Lookin' for you
# You're a rebel now
# Don't give a damn
# Always carrying on
# With the gang
# I'm tryin' to tell ya boy
# It's a mistake
# You won't realize
# 'til it's too late
# Don't understand
# Why you insist
# On ways of living such a dangerous life
# Time after time you stay away
# And i just know that you're telling me lies
# Black cat nine lives
# Short days long nights
# Livin' on the edge
# Not afraid to die
# Heart beat real strong
# But not for long
# Better watch your step
# Or you're gonna die
# You're so together boy
# But just at a glance
# You'll do anything
# If given the chance
# Scheming, plannin' lies
# To get what you need
# So full of promises
# That you never keep
# Don't you tell yourself
# That it's okay
# Sick and tired of
# All of your games
# And you want me to stay
# (aww) Better change
# Makes no sense to me
# Your crazy ways
# Black cat nine lives
# Short days long nights
# Livin' on the edge
# Not afraid to die
# Heart beat real strong
# But not for long
# Better watch your step
# Or you're gonna die

# Nothing's gonna stop us
# We can't be stopped
# I know that it's not been easy
# Tryin' to make it in this crazy world
# But people around you try to stop you, stop you
# Saying that you don't belong
# You must remember that
# (You must remember)
# We were born with blood of kings and queens that can't be stopped
# (They can't be stopped)
# Stand strong my sister you can't be stopped
# (Stand strong my sister)
# No you can't be stopped
# I know that sometimes you get to feelin' not giving up on you
# The pressure seems to defeat you
# Whenever you can't go on
# You must remember that
# (You must remember)
# You were born of blood of kings and queens that can't be stopped
# (No, they can't be stopped)
# Stand tall my brother you can't be stopped
# (Stand tall my brother)
# No you can't be stopped
# Don't ever let nobody tell you "you ain't strong enough"
# Strong enough
# Don't let nobody tell you "you ain't strong enough"
# Don't let nobody tell you
# You know that I will be right here
# To remind you that we need togetherness
# 'Cause the long ride has no forgave you
# Don't forget where you come from
# You must remember that
# (You must remember)
# We were born with blood of kings and queens that can't be stopped
# (They can't be stopped)
# Stand strong my sister you can't be stopped
# (Sister stand strong)
# No you can't be stopped
# (You can't be stopped my sister)
# You must remember that
# (You must remember)
# We were born with blood of kings and queens that can't be stopped
# (You can't be stopped)
# Stand tall my brother you can't be stopped
# (Stand tall my brother)
# No you can't be stopped
# (No you can't be stopped)
# Ohhh...
# Strong enough
# I won't let nobody tell you "you ain't strong enough"
# I won't let nobody tell you "you aint..."
# Ohhh...
# Strong enough
# I won't let nobody tell you "you ain't strong enough"
# I won't let nobody tell you "you ain't..."
# Ohhh...
# Strong enough
# I won't let nobody tell you "you ain't strong enough"

# The energy I see
# The silence that you speak
# The lust within my dreams
# And what I t says to me
# This full heart of mine
# You just can’t empty
# So come lay with me
# China love
# How pleasant life will be
# China love
# As the sun retires
# Our love will transpire
# Make love to me
# China love
# I see the sunshine
# When I look into your eyes
# They speak of worlds gone by
# We loved another time
# My heart was empty
# Till you came to be
# So come lay with me
# China love
# How pleasant life will be
# China love
# As the sun retires
# Our love will transpire
# Make love to me

# I close my eyes and fantasize
# And I just imagine
# A tropical island
# We're all alone
# Our pagers and cell phones shut off
# Hot sunny heat
# Cool ocean breeze
# The sand beneath our feet
# The crashing waves are like music
# Found a place to sleep
# Passion fruit to eat
# Use all our energy
# Under the moonlight making love
# I don't think nothing can compare
# Nothing better than
# (Time)
# Nothing better than
# (Or anywhere)
# Nothing better than
# (Cause I'm)
# Spending time with you
# Nothing better than
# (As friend)
# Nothing better than
# (I'm so content)
# Nothing better than
# (Cause I'm)
# Spending time with you
# [Verse 2]
# You are my angel
# Heaven is close
# My favorite place is where you are
# So we don't have to do nothing special
# Don't wanna run
# It's always fun to chill at home
# Monday through Friday
# Sexy Saturday
# Easy Sunday
# Cause every day's a special one
# Just like a holiday
# Vacation getaway
# After the foreplay
# Go room to room making sweet love
# I don't think nothing can compare
# Nothing better than
# Nothing better than
# Nothing better than
# Spending time with you
# Nothing better than
# Nothing better than
# Nothing better than
# Spending time
# I need time
# Morning, noon and night
# Just keep it coming, baby
# Just keep me coming, baby

# The islands
# Anguila that's my favorite
# I love the Islands
# That's my escapism
# They relax me
# That ocean
# The weather
# I love humidity
# I love the sand
# I love the palm trees
# I love curling up in a good book
# And relaxing right by the ocean
# With my baby

# The confusion lifts

> Janet Jackson
# When I first met you
# I swear that I was straight with you
# I wasn't looking for nobody new
# I just needed someone to talk to
# You said you were cool and understood
# But now you caught feelings like I knew you would
# And you sitting there with a broken heart
# Cause I have you my body and not my heart
# When I'm holding you late at night
# I'm thinkin' bout my ex
# When I'm kissing you and look at you
# I'm thinkin' bout my ex
# And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
# And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
# [Verse 2]
# Baby I have to be
# Unselfish and true to me
# Cause I'm not where I really want to be
# And It's nothing with you
# It's all me
# I toss and turn all night when I sleep
# Want and reaching for someone who use to be
# Said it must be some karma thing
# Cause I can't seem to let go and love again
# [Chorus 2]
# When I lay with you I close my eyes
# I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
# When I'm touching you gently
# I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
# And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
# And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
# When I'm listing to music I'm thinking' 'bout my ex
# In a bubble bath with the candles lit
# I'm thinking 'bout my ex
# And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
# And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
# You're beautiful
# I don't wanna take the space from someone else
# So let me go
# And do a little soul searchin' for myself
# I'm so sorry that
# I pulled you in and let it get this far
# You know I never meant to break your heart
# [Chorus 3]
# At the shopping mall or movies
# I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
# At the restaurant while I'm eating
# I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
# And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
# And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
# While you talk to me I drift away
# I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
# When you ask me what I'm thinkin'
# I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
# And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
# And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart

# Pull over
# Let me do all the work

# I love every sound you make
# When I'm down
# Nothing can prepare you for
# The Warmth of my
# [Verse 1]
# Mouth against your mouth
# Getting you aroused
# Whisper in your ear
# I think I'll take it further south
# Kissing on your neck
# Rubbing on your leg
# Slide a little further up
# I feel you get erect
# And now we're flesh against flesh
# Breathing on your chest
# So anxious to touch it
# My mouth is getting wet
# Just like the water from the shore
# Let your rain pour
# Baby brace yourself for
# [Chorus 2]
# My hands wrapped around
# Stroking up and down (let's see how long you can last inside)
# But nothing can compare to the warmth of my mouth
# I love every sound you make
# When I'm down (Just hear the water splash about)
# But nothing can prepare you for
# The warmth of my mouth
# No place warmer than my mouth....
# Start off slow
# Circles
# Then deeper and deep it goes
# Kisses so sensual
# Tasteful

# The warmth of my...

# In bolj, ko srečo

# da vedno krajši niz postaja
# prepozno, kakor vsak spozna.
# Zdaj tisoč milj od raja,

# I'm almost sure about the words - but there might be small mistakes .
# ( In my opinion this is one of the most beautiful songs ever written )
# I don't  want to ride that milk train anymore .
# I'll go to bed at nine - and waken with the dawn ,
# and lunch at haft past noon - dinner prompt at five .
# The comfort of a few old friends long  past their prime .
# Pass the tea and sympathy for the good old days long gone -
# we'll drink a toast to those who most believe in what they've won -
# it's a long long time till morning lay's wasted on the dawn .
# I'll not write another line - for my true love is gone .
# When the guests have gone - I'll tidy up the room - I'll turn the covers down -
# and gazing at the moon - I'll pray to go quite mad - and living long ago .
# When you and I were once - so very long ago .
# Pass the tea and sympathy for the good old days long gone -
# we'll drink a toast to those who most believe in what they've won
# it's a long , long time till morning - lay's wasted on the dawn .
# I'll not write another line - for my true love is gone .
# When I have no dreams to give you anymore - I'll light a blazing fire -
# and wait within the door - I'll through my life away -
# "I wonder why" they all will say .
# Now I lay me down to sleep - for ever and a day .
# Pass the tea and sympathy for the good old days are dead .
# will drink a toast to those who best survive the life they've lead .
# it's a long , long time till morning - so build your fire high .
# Now I lay me down to sleep - forever by your side .

# A little of this, A little of that
# Kinda happy, Kinda sad
# Just the other night the baby was cryin
# So I got out of bed rocked her awhile and I held her tight

# And when the coyotes they sing at the park
# Till the city lights starts falling
# Ride them rodes they winding down till the flame hits the ground
# Every motion is closer to touching the coyotes sing when they call in the middle of it.
# Coming back for more,
# You know I'm coming for you
# You know we should be should be together
# While we rock, we won't put a stop
# Not today not tomorrow.
# You better lock your doors
# You know why, cuz we want you

# I wish the world was a live like you.
# I wish the world would help me through
# Another repetuity to approach you

# I wish you would walk when your jogging
# You got a duty to sell in mexico
# I got to try to keep you acting shady
# I don't like liking you when you walk because
# I gotta figure out the snooze alarm

# And when the coyotes escape to new york
# Then the city lights has crumbles to the sea
# And the girls turned it into lost and found
# The flying metal hit the ground
# Every motion is closer to touching the coyotes singing
# I'm a coyote and I got a taste for your loving
# You know I will come for you

# I love that smell on you,
# And I got your special place against this face for tasting too.
# And I like it natural,
# No need for chemicals.
# Foggin?up my senses
# You're making me sensless
# You're calling it sexual.
# And you're going to get yours, my lady.
# Might even be today.
# And it ain't no thing because I'll be rolling right along with you-woo-woo.
# You are the sweetest thing I've found since whenever.
# You're the only way my time is measured.
# You might be the silent type.
# But you're appetizing louder now.
# It's crazy how you're killing me.
# And give us both a break.
# And to give us back a taste when the way things were before they made the laws,
# And to give us both a chance,
# But it won't be the last romance cause when the weekend starts the guilty party's on.
# BREAKDOWN!!
# Weekend party's over,
# Don't stop, let's get closer.
# Friday, got cold shoulder,
# Monday, got a new composure.
# Weekend party's over,
# Don't stop, let's get lower.
# I won't blow your cover,
# Opportunistic lover.
# Weekend party's over,
# Don't stop, let's get closer.
# Friday's mediocre,
# Monday, I'm self-exposed now.
# Weekend party's over,
# Don't stop, let's suppose-ah
# I won't blow your cover
# Opportunistic lover.

# I'm just a man, is that all I am
# Are my manners misinterpreted words or only human?
# I'm human

# Is that a twig, are you a dove of peace
# A black dove undercover, with another puzzle piece

# Yes we are, only human, only human, so far, so far
# And this place it will outlive me
# Before I get to heaven I'll climb that tree
# And I will have to give my thanks
# For giving me the branch to swing on
# If I ever fall in love
# I'll have to give myself a baby
# I will let my children have their way

# What is it that they want me to be
# Can't keep up this fight no more
# Won't keep up this fight no more

# Where I can do what I want and be free to be myself
# I gotta run to my world, my world
# Coz I aint comfortable with trying to be somebody else

# I gotta get away from this crazy life
# Get away from the hype
# Get away from this two and two makes five
# Take a look beyond what they see
# Maybe you will realise
# So come with me
# On my roller-coaster ride
# When you go to sleep at night you dream
# Of all the things you've always wanted to be

# Well here's a story of a different kinda love
# With the views of a man
# Who's confused and had enough
# When a girl he thought he knew
# Wasn't all he bought into
# She tried to make him
# The man that she always wanted to
# Thinking back to the first few days
# You used to say you didn't mind my age
# So I was younger it didn't mean a thing
# Now I've got a feeling I'm a puppet on a string
# You thought it was cute how my jeans would sag
# And how u used to laugh when I talked in slang
# Now the same things you despise
# I can tell when out in public how you roll your eyes
# Chorus
# You almost had me in the palm of your hand girl
# (Need to be alone)
# Cos all you see is a boy in a mans world
# (Find a place to go)
# You almost had me in the palm of your hand girl
# (That I could call my own)
# Cos all you see is a boy in a mans world
# (Won't you let me Rhome)
# I'm a student but you work full time
# Which means I'm over drawn but you knew that mind
# And now your moaning I don't pay the rent
# So you lie about my job in front all of your friends
# Truth be told I don't know no more
# If I can tell you everything I've learnt
# For sure
# About how you think it'd go like this
# (Laugh) I think you catch my drift
# Chorus
# Well here is a story of
# A different kinda love
# With the views of a man
# Who's confused
# I wasn't man enough not mature enough
# Comes a time when a mans gotta choose
# I can't take this sh** won't take this sh**
# Don't you cry cos it's not any use
# Was this all a game under ball and chain
# Look at me this is me cutting loose
# Chorus
> Jay Sean
# Jay Sean vs Jay Sean
# Me against myself
# And there ain't no chorus
# So just listen
# Mentor
# Oh girl
# You look so beautiful
# With that moonlight shining on you
# I wanna hold you
# I wanna touch you and squeeze you
# And love you all night long
# Oh Baby girl
# Yo I've heard it before
# So save all the cliche
# I really can't believe there's no talent around these days
# Jay Sean, with the same old sh**
# Talking abou babygirl that and babygirl this
# I seen you dancing around with the girl in your vid
# Pouting at the camera, smiling with the cheesiest grin
# What the deal?
# Whatever happened to keeping it real?
# Back in the day
# When you was rapping, before the time of your deal
# And now you got signed
# Its all clear and its simple
# You're only making music
# That you pretend that you're into (haha)
# Come on dance with you was never a hit fool
# And what the hell is taking you so long with your next single?!
# (fix up)
# Fix up?
# It's been about 6 months
# And insults are everywhere
# Even your own fans think your sh** sucks
# (I don't like Jay Sean)
# And I know you pretend to ignore it
# It's gotta hurt when you're even getting dissed on your own forum
# Yeh I've done my research
# Back when you started for
# Back when people thought you was the genuine article
# Genuine my ass!
# You're just a wack imitation
# The only thing different about you
# Is the fact that you're asian
# Well I guess it must've helped a bit
# The fact that everything that has an Asian twist
# Including music I guess we're calling it
# I'm surprised that Simon Cowell hasn't thought of it
# And there's issues that I find myself being faced with
# Being pigeon holed and accused of imitating
# It's a struggle and it's so frustrating
# Telling me I'm tryna be the asian Craig David
# And I bet that just had you in tears
# Wasn't that the reason you ended up shaving your beard?
# I guess you couldn't take the way people would mock that
# So it was off with the jaw line
# And goodbye to the sock hat
# But you still a bit of style
# With the fastest singing on verse two of Dance With You
# Now you wonder why they couldn't slander you
# Well you say you done your research baby
# You didn't look hard enough, it needs updating
# If you think that I'm copying Craig
# Listen to my 1994 demo tape
# I was Fast rapping and singing back in the day
# Back in the niggahs and Big L phase
# Psshhhh
# Whatever
# It seems you sold your soul to the game
# You're a fake coz Jay Sean aint even your name
# So how'd you come up with that?
# It ain't unique after all
# What are you?
# Like a cross between Jay-Z and Sean Paul?
# You're better off with the name you was born
# You little pansy you really should have been called Gay Porn
# So which one's your lover?
# Rishi Rich or Juggy D?
# Probably Rishi
# He sees you as his bi*** doesn't he?
# Wasn't he the one responsible for launching your career?
# Like a while ago I'm talking like well over a year
# You were studying medicine then
# But you quit that now, to do music
# How the hell did you manage to flip that round?
# And how'd you tell your parents
# You know how sh** that sounds
# Mummy Daddy, I want to be a pop star
# SIT BACK DOWN!
# But never the less
# I quit, went ahead and progressed
# Had my eyes on my goal and wouldn't settle for less
# What do you mean?
# You only got where you are cos of a gimmick
# The whole Indian thing was big
# And you were luckily in it
# And don't be upset if people don't come to your shows
# They're not allowed out
# Coz half of your fans are 11 year olds
# (JaySean)
# Wow big deal you got to number 12
# I'm not surprised If your mum brought half of the copies herself
# You know what I'm tired man
# I'm sick, I'm bored of you
# Run off you little puppet
# I hear Rishi Rich calling you
# I guess you talk the talk
# But you were rapping for years
# And it was me who got your foot in the door
# Its seems that your ego has been suffering blows
# Cos you only get heard when you guest appear on my shows
# I'm not phased
# If it wasn't for me
# You wouldn't be on this track in the first place!

# Thinking bout all of those days I left behind
# Nowadays it seems I'm watching life just pass me by
# The world is spinning beneath my feet at an unforgiving pace
# And I, I just find myself falling victim to the chase
# If only I could take it back, to the days when I was younger
# Then maybe I would cherish that moment I grew older
# Finally I understand that time won't wait for no one (no no no)
# I can't live in the past
# Chorus:
# On and on, on and on, it don't look back (people move)
# On and on, on and on, they won't look back (and thought I've moved)
# On and on, on and on, I won't forget
# What it took to get me here,
# How much I sacrificed
# Maybe I allowed myself to be consumed
# Turned my back on what once the only life I knew
# Too busy loving me to notice everything had changed
# Now I've come to terms that nothing ever stays the same
# If only I could take it back, to the days when I was younger
# Then maybe I would cherish that moment I grew older
# Finally I understand that time won't wait for no one (no no no)
# I can't live in the past
# Now I see, that on the road that I chose
# I can't leave, when the weakness begins to show
# Finally, I just gotta let it go
# Chorus
> Jay Sean
# Baby girl I want you to just listen for a while
# Put your arguments on hold so you can try to hear me out
# Coz everytime we try to talk it out, you just deny
# That the spark is gone and something's wrong with you and I
# I said I will change, I'm gonna try
# It ain't enough and I wonder why
# What do you want?
# What do you need?
# I got the feeling it isn't me
# Another day, another fight
# I'm in the wrong, guess you're in the right
# Is this a game? Coz we're gonna lose
# Girl, I'm so confused
# One minute I love you
# Next minute I hate you
# One minute I need you
# So, baby, tell me, what am I to do?
# One minute of sunshine
# No, it ain't enough to keep me here
# Coz it'll pass us by and and leave us in the cold
# Is this how it's meant to be?
# Is love just one confusing game?
# And we're just pawns that don't know all the rules but play it anyway
# Coz everyday's a drama, one we've seen a thousand times
# Girl, to me it seems you love messing with my mind
# You gotta change, you gotta try
# It ain't enough and I wonder why
# Coz what you want and what you need
# I got the feeling it isn't me
# Some other day, some other time
# Maybe you and I would've been alright
# It was a game, didn't know the rules
# Now it's left me torn in two
# Get away, get away from me
# Girl, won't you just sail away, yeah
# Get away, get away from me
# Coz I don't love you no longer, no longer

# Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
# all of my dates been blind dates
# But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
# I'm mashin the gas, she's grabbin the wheel, it's true to the heart
# She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
# Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"
# She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
# She's right back to being my soldier
# Cuz mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
# Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
# What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
# When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
# So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be

# Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
# And so I put this on my life
# Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
# And I promise I'll give my life

# Rap critics that say he's "Money Cash Hoes"
# I'm from the hood stupid what type of facts are those
# If you grew up with holes in your zapitos
# You'd celebrate the minute you was havin doe
# I'm like fuck critics you can kiss my whole asshole
# If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward
# Got beef with radio if i don't play they show
# They don't play my hits well i don't give a shit SO
# Rap mags try and use my black ass
# So advertisers can give em more cash for ads...fuckers

# In my rear view mirror is the mother fuckin law
# I got two choices yall pull over the car or
# Bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor
# Now i ain't tryin to see no highway chase with jake
# Plus i got a few dollars i can fight the case
# So i...pull over to the side of the road
# And i heard "Son do you know why i'm stoppin you for?"
# Cause i'm young and i'm black and my hats real low
# Do i look like a mind reader sir, i don't know
# Am i under arrest or should i guess some mo?
# "Well you was doin fifty five in a fifty four"
# "Liscense and regestration and step out of the car"
# "Are you carryin a weapon on you i know alot of you are"
# I ain't steppin out of shit all my papers legit
# "Do you mind if i look round the car a little bit?"
# Well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk and the back
# And i know my rights so you gon' need a warrent for that
# "Aren't you sharp as a tack are some type of lawyer or something?"
# "Or somebody important or somethin?"
# Nah i ain't pass the bar but i know a little bit

# I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
# Hit me

# [Verse Three]
# Now once upon a time not too long ago
# A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe
# This is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy
# But a pussy havin no God Damn sense, try and push me
# I tried to inore him and talk to the Lord
# Pray for him, cause some fools just love to perform
# You know the type loud as a motor bike
# But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
# The only thing that's gonna happen is i'mma get to clappin
# He and his boys gon be yappin to the captain
# And there i go traped in the kit kat again
# Back through the system with the riff raff again
# Fiends on the floor scratchin again
# Paparatzi's with they cameras snappin them
# D.A. tred to give the nigga the shaft again
# Half-a-mil for bail cause i'm African
# All because ths fool was horrasin them
# Tryin to play the boy like hes saccarin
# But ain't nothin sweet 'bout how i hold my gun

# This here's a ballad for all the fallen soldiers
# I'ma bout 'ta show you how a hustlers life (this is life man)
# and a soldier's life, parallel
# And the one thing they got in common is pain (forget about me for a second)
# Picture split screen
# On one side we got a hustler getting ready for the block (human beings)
# Other side you got the soldier getting ready for bootcamp (soldiers)
# They're both at war (this is life)
# Stay with us
# [Chorus]
# Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
# So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass
# [Verse 1]
# You lost him mama, the wars calling him
# Feel its his duty to fall in line with all of them
# He's a soldier
# Rose through the ranks as the head of your house hold
# Now its time to provide bank
# Like he's supposed tah
# Now just remember while he's going to November
# Theres part of him growing up
# His shirts soaks up your tears as he holds yah
# Your heart beatin so fast speeding his pulse up
# Yeah i know it sucks, Life aint a rose bud
# A couple of speed bumps
# You gotta take your lumps
# Off to Bootcamp, the worlds facing terror
# Bin Laden been happenin in Manhatten
# Crack was anthrax back then, back when
# Police was Al'Qaeda to black men
# While I was out there hustling sinning with no religion
# He was off the wall killing for a living
# [Chorus]
# [Verse 2]
# Days turn to nights, nights turn to years
# Years turn to "how the fuck we make it in here?"
# My barracks average couple fights a day
# Get you locked in a hole wont see the light of day
# And I feel like I'm just writing my life away
# I never thought shit could end up quite this way
# There's a war going on outside no man is safe from
# I'm here for the good fight only the fakes run
# I'm here for the purple heart, if I cant take one
# For my team or my siblings whats my reason for living?
# I love my niggas more then anything else
# This war's about my family, me needin the wealth
# You dont understand how useless as men we felt
# Till you become a 5 star general
# Shout out to my niggas that's locked in jail
# P.O.W.'s thats still in the war for real
# [Chorus]
# Your baby boy is getting grown
# So your baby boy is moving on
# I've gotta chase (gotta chase it)
# If I'm gonna make it (gonna make it)
# Your baby boy is getting grown
# So your baby boy is moving on
# I'm gonna make it
# Even if I gotta take it (gotta take it)
# [Verse 3]
# Mama said pray your sons becoming a man
# This wars taxin to 'em like Uncle Sam
# He ain't gonna always make the right choice, understand
# Every choice that he make he makes it for his fam
# It's death before dishonour
# And if hes gone you should honor his memory
# Dont cry we all gonna die eventually
# But if he's locked in the penetentiary send him some energy
# They all winners to me

# [Verse One: Jay-Z]
# Growin up in the hood just my dog and me
# We used to hustle in the hood for, all to see
# Problems, I called on him, he called on me
# We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
# Met him unlocked doors, off my keys
# Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially
# Man he broke bread with me, my business spreads with me
# The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
# Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
# Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
# Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
# And when he called collect and I heard his name
# I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
# he's talkin reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
# I said, "Damn dawg, what, nine weeks and you're home?"
# He said, "Main man, you think shit's sweet cause you're home."
# I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
# The crackers up there bleachin your dome, you're reachin
# I said, "The world don't stop I've got to keep keep on."
# From there I sensed the beef was on
# I ran to the spot, store to add some more features to my phone
# To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
# Can't be too safe cause niggaz is two-faced
# And they show the other side when they catch a new case

# Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
# Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry
# That's right, the same game that make you mad could make you die

# Shit I know how this movie ends, still I play
# the starrin role in "Hovito's Way"
# [Chorus]
# It's just life, I solemnly swear
# To change my approach, stop shavin coke
# Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
# Cause I be doin the most.. oh no!
# But every time I felt that was that, it called me right back
# It called me right back, man it called me right back - oh no!
# [Verse Two]
# I'm like a Russian mobster, drinkin distilled vodka
# 'Til I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real
# Pillow-top him like a toupee
# Mix the water, with the soda
# Turn the pot up make a souflee
# All of y'all can get it like group-ays in your 2-way
# I'm livin proof that crime do pay
# Say hooray to the bad guy, and all the broads
# puttin cars in they name for the stars of the game
# Puttin 'caine in they bras and their tomorrows on the train
# All in the name of love
# Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
# over the house to take back, everything that they claimed
# Or even the worst pain is the distress
# Learnin you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
# And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
# Now it gets tough to ever love a-gain
# But the allure of the game, keeps callin your name
# To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
# To all the Christies in every cities and Tiffany Lanes
# We all hustlers, in love with the same thang
# [Chorus]
# [Verse Three]
# I never felt more alive than ridin shotgun
# In Cline's green 5 until the cops pulled guns
# And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need
# what the game did to my pulse, with no results
# And you can treat your nose and still won't come close
# The game is a lightbulb with eleventy-million volts
# And I'm just a mark, addicted to the floss
# And doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
# By any means necessary, whatever the cost
# Even if it means lives is lost..
# And I can't explain why, I just love to get high
# Drink life, smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice
# I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times
# I may not even be alive
# How mean James Dean couldn't escape the allure
# Dyin young, leavin a good lookin corpse
# Of course
# [Chorus]
# Once again it's the life
# I said it's the life
# Once again it's the life - oh no!
# (I don't why I) why I (get so high on)
# get so (get so high on) uh-huh
# (get so high - high off the life!)
# Hahahahahahaha - woo!

# Ain't nothin' wrong with aim, just gotta change the target

# And head to the heights where big coke is processed
# You gotta convince 'em that you not from the Precinct
# Please speak slow, cause he no speakey no english
# If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
# If your money is straight, he's gon' give you consignment
# You're now in a game where only time can tell
# Survive the droughts, I wish you well...

# How sick am I? I wish you HEALTH
# I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
# I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
# You could see the signs, when the jackets is schemin'

# My best friends gone, I seen bad days
# Still find songs that I hear him on

# The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame, a list of hits next to all my names
# I came, if the sky should fall
# And it all goes tomorrow, and they foreclose on the house and auction off all my cars
# Don't cry for me Argentina, I mobbed the beamer

# 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
# I don't know why we here
# Since we gotta be here
# Life is but a beach chair
# Went from having shabby clothes
# Crossing over Abbey Roads
# Hear my angels singing to me
# Are you happy HOV?
# I just hope I'm hearing right
# Karma's got me fearing life
# Colleek are you praying for me?
# I got demons in my past
# So I got a daughters on the way
# If the prophecy's correct
# Then the child should have to pay
# For the sins of a father
# So I barter my tomorrows
# Against my yesterdays
# In hopes that she'll be OK
# And when I'm no longer here
# The shade of face from the glare
# I'll give her my share of Carol's Daugther
# And a new beach chair

# Life is but a dream to me
# Gun shots sing to these
# Other guys but lullabys
# Don't mean a thing to me
# I'm not afraid of dying
# I'm afraid of not trying
# Everyday hit every wave
# Like I'm Hawaiian
# I don't surf the net
# No I never been on MySpace
# Too busy letting my voice vibrate
# Carving out my space
# In this world of fly girls
# Cutthroats and diamonds cut ropes I twirls
# Benz's round corners
# Where the sun don't shine
# I let the wheels give a glimpse
# Of hope of one's grind
# Some said, "HOV, how you get so fly?"
# I said, "from not being afraid to fall out the sky"
# my physical's a shell, so when I say farewell
# my soul will find an even higher plane to dwell.
# so fly you shall, so have no fear, just know that life is just but a beach chair

# Can't mimic my life

# To interrupt life
# That's why I'm both
# The saint and the sinner
# Nice
# This is Jay everyday
# No compromise
# No compass comes with this life
# Just eyes
# So to map it out
# You must look inside
# Sure books can guide you
# But your heart defines you
# Chica
# Your corason is what brought us home
# In great shape like Heidi Klum
# Maricon, I am on
# Permanent vaca
# Life is but a beach chair
# This song is like a Hallmark card
# Until you reach there
# So till she's here
# And she declared
# The air
# I will be prepared
# A blueprint for you to print
# A map so you can back
# A guide for your eyes
# And so you won't lose scent
# I'll make a stink for you to think
# I ink these verses full of prose
# So you won't get conned out of 2 cent
# My last will and testament I leave my heir

# Sean Carter was born December 4th
# Weighing in at 10 pounds 8 ounces
# He was the last of my 4 children
# The only one who didn't give me any pain when i gave birth to him
# And that's how i knew that he was a special child
# [Jay-Z Verse 1]
# They say "they never really miss you til you dead or you gone"
# So on that note i'm leaving after the song
# So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long
# Atleast let me tell you why i'm this way, Hold on
# I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adaness Revees
# Who made love under the Siccamore tree
# Which makes me
# A more sicker M.C. and my momma would claim
# At 10 pounds when i was born i didn't give her no pain
# Although through the years i gave her her fair share
# I gave her her first real scare
# I made it from birth and i got here
# She knows my purpose wasn't purpose
# I ain't perfect i care
# But i feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matchin my gear
# Now i'm just scratchin the surface cause what's burried under there
# Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
# I went to school got good grades could behave when i wanted
# But i had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
# Hold on

# Shawn was a very shy child growing up
# He was into sports
# And a funny story is
# At 4 he taught hisself how to ride a bike

# Now all the teachers couldn't reach me
# And my momma couldn't beat me
# Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seeing me, SO
# With that distain in my membrain
# Got on my pimp game
# Fuck the world my defense came
# Then Dahaven introuced me to the game
# Spanish Jose introduced me to cane
# I'm a hustler now
# My gear is in and i'm in the in crowd
# And all the wavey light skinned girls is lovin me now
# My self esteem went through the roof man i got my swag
# Got a volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
# Plus i hit my momma with cash from a show that i had
# Supposedly knowin nobody paid Jaz wack ass
# I'm geting ahead of myself, by the way, i could rap
# That came second to me movin this crack
# Gimme a second i swear
# I will say about my rap career
# Til 96 came niggas i'm here

# Shawn use to be in the kitchen
# Beating on the table and rapping
# And um, until the wee hours of the morning
# And then i bought him a boom box
# And his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts
# But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble
# [Jay-Z Verse 3]
# Good-bye to the game all the spoils, the adreneline rush
# Your blood boils you in a spot knowing cops could rush
# And you in a drop your so easy to touch
# No two days are alike
# Except the first and fifteenth pretty much
# And "trust" is a word you seldom hear from us
# Hustlers we don't sleep we rest one eye up
# And the drought to find a man when the well dries up
# You learn to work the water without workin thirst til die YUP
# And niggas get tied up for product
# And little brothers ring fingers get cut up
# To show mothers they really got em
# And this was the stress i live with til i decided
# To try this rap shit for a livin
# I Pray i'm forgiven
# For every bad decision i made
# Every sister i played
# Cause i'm still paranoid to this day
# And it's nobody fault i made the decisions i made
# This is the life i chose or rather the life that chose me
# If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack

# And do you deny you're responsible for the demise

# Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
# [Chorus]
# Now can I get an encore, do you want more
# Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
# So for one last time I need y'all to roar
# Now what the hell are you waitin for
# After me, there shall be no more
# So for one last time, nigga make some noise
# [Verse One]
# Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
# The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
# Can't none of y'all mirror me back
# Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime
# I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
# Back to take over the globe, now break bread
# I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
# Out the country but the blueberry still connect
# On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
# But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
# Grand openin, grand closin
# God damn your man Hov' cracked the can open again
# Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
# just draw off inspiration
# Soon you gon' see you can't replace him
# with cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS
# [Chorus - 1/2]
# {What the hell are you waiting forrrr?}
# [Verse Two]
# [sighs] Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
# Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
# When you first come in the game, they try to play you
# Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
# From Marcy to Madison Square
# To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)
# As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
# to be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
# When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5
# It ain't to play games witchu
# It's to aim at you, probably maim you
# If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereeens
# Cocksucker take one for your team
# And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
# I came, I saw, I conquered
# From record sales, to sold out concerts
# So muh'fucker if you want this encore
# I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore
# [Interlude]
# OWWWW! It's star time
# This man is MADE! He's KILLIN all y'all jive turkeys
# Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
# Well if y'all want more of the Jigga man
# Then I need y'all to help me, bring him back to stage
# Say Hova, c'mon say it!
# HO-VA! HO-VA! Are y'all out there? [crowd chants "HO-VA! HO-VA!"]
# Are y'all out there? C'mon, louder!
# Yeah, now see that's what I'm talkin bout

# Then I'm lea-vin, that's how you get me back
# After a year of them 16's, it's one point two
# And that's two point four, and I'm only doin two
# You wanted to gain attention new dudes
# I can get you BET and TRL too
# You wanna be in the public, send your budget
# Well fuck it, I ain't budgin!
# Young did it to death, you gotta love it
# Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
# Now look at me, all star-studded

# Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)

# I took ya outta Jacob's in clusters
# Busters they wanted to rush us
# Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
# When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
# You can light up the whole room, turning day from night
# When the summertime is in and the tops are down
# With you around my neck we lock the whole block down (that's right)
# It took shortsleeves and loungin' to understand
# The reason they call you ice, everybody freeze
# Ain't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you
# And that platinum in the charm who can blind like you
# The direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do
# I used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools
# Guess I was jealous that they was so next to you
# So I devoted half my time to invest in you
# The other half was spent on protecting you
# Cause you belong to me, now sing ya song for me
# C'mon

# [Jay-Z]
# I'm often with you so they wonder bout the juice I got
# I took you from the projects and an abusive pops
# From the bottom to the top
# The skateboard to the drop
# From the nada to the Prada
# I got ya like I got ya
# From the first time I put you round my neck and locked ya
# It was then I knew everywhere I went you'd follow
# Soon I spent every dolla you became my habit
# other brothers vice was smoke, mines was carats
# The more checks I got the more I laced my crew
# The rocks got bigger, watch face got blue
# Tricked a little bit, shit I lace my Boo
# Fuck it, my mistress I laced her too
# Cop my jewels twice, like deja vu
# If they ever met in the mall, it's ova ya'll
# Just the way I do, and either way you win
# I mean the thugs love ya when your girl's best friend

# And the wedding band you love
# In the gold chain you thug
# Sometimes you given just because
# And the tennis bracelet means they want relations
# Know that they wanna fuck the only reason they give you up

# Niggas actin' like I sold you crack
# Like I told you sell drugs, no Hov did that
# So hopefully you wouldn't have to go through that
# I was raised in the pro-jects roaches and rats
# Smokers out back sellin' they momma's sofa
# Lookouts on the corner, focused on the Ave.
# Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
# Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand close?
# Crack's in my arm, watchin the long arm of the law
# So you know I seen it all before
# I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
# The try and the fail, the two things I hate
# Succeed in this rap game the two things that's great
# H to the izz O, V to the izz A
# What else can I say about dude I gets busy
# H to the izz O, V to the izz A
# Fa shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in V-A

# Hollywood's been good to ya
# Startin to feel like buzz to ya
# Don't lie, go on fly, you're addicted to the light
# Without the fame, how you gon' survive?
# It's like bein on heroin, you so high
# [Beyonce:]
# And everybodyies warning you about it (I tried to told you)
# And once you taste it you can't live without it (It's addicting)
# Not cuz you choose to not live without it (you sure you want this baby)
# It's now a part of you, it's now a part of you (It's a part of you)
# And everybodies warning you about it
# And once you taste it you can't live

# Wanna be seen now, groupies
# Now you've become what you once despised
# James Dean, John Belushi, blow your whole life trying to live in the lights
# Heroin's following, Marijuane hopping over the edge
# It's like Janis Joplin
# River Pheonix, Jimi Hendrix
# Jimmy Morrison all of them ended by Hollywood
# Thank God for Hollywood
# Hollywood...
# you sure you want this baby?
# Hollywood, it's the most addicting drug in the world
# You want the fame
# You want the lights

# Uh, its the boy Jay-Z, and the boy R. Kel
# The best of both worlds, please believe it
# Brookland, Chi-Town, to all the beautiful ladies in the world
# Dedicated to TT my niece, everybody in the world, talk to 'em Kel
# That's right, Tone this is mean and vicious man, so mean and vicious
# Rockland, Roc-a-Fella, the best of both worlds, come on
# [Verse 1: Jay-Z]
# Lord forgive me I'm ballin' out of control
# Got the spirit of a hustler pouring out of my soul
# Mami I love you but ain't no stopping my stroll
# If you wanna be down with me you gotta rooolll
# Like a roll and if my side of the bed gets cold
# You gotta know that I'm out chasin' doooough
# I'm ain't stunting these hoes
# Stunting my growth if I fuck 'em I'm fleeing them
# I need something to hold
# Then I'm home to you
# I might roam like a cellular phone
# But I never leave you alone I
# Solemnly swear, I was married to the block before I met you
# It's still a part of me there but I
# Solemnly swear, I try but it's in my blood
# Pumping yay since I was yay high
# I'm in love with the life
# So except me for the bastard that I am
# You're still in love with me right?
# [Chorus: R. Kelly]
# Baby I can't figure it out
# Said you pussy tastes like honey
# But I can't stop huggin' the block
# All night tryna get this money
# Stuck between these two worlds
# What I'm gonna do with both these girls
# Two main squeezes in separate cities
# Both found out man, shit ain't pretty
# Stuck between these two worlds
# What I'm gonna do with both these girls
# Hard to choose between her and these streets
# Cuz the game keeps calling me
# [Verse 2: Jay-Z]
# Baby girl had me off my grind, off my clock
# I would often find I was off my block
# Couldn't keep her off my mind, my balls were shot
# They never thought that a pause or stop
# Was in my pores to push rock raw
# Take a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw
# Got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low
# Like a one against the grain
# Got the sun against my brain
# A girl in my ear
# I like her for her
# I'm a dig into this shit, I like it like I like her
# Sometimes I can't figure it out
# I'm in love with the life but she's sticking it out
# She know wanna hug kisses keep a nigga in the house
# Lock down while his niggas is out (out)

# Yeah, I know you just ripped the packaging off your CD
# If you like me you readin the credits right now
# If you in your car, I don't care if it's winter
# I want you to put all your windows down
# Zone out, buckle up, let's go
# Hello it's Hova; that's right young'un the wait is over
# The new millineum is upon us, the album is here
# Before we get into the shit, let's get a few things clear
# Rappers with no relation:
# there's "Seven Degrees of Seperation" and I'm Kevin Bacon
# This is the murderer's version
# Jigga the shit, even when he rhyme in third person
# Hova the God, I should be rappin with turban
# Haters can't disturb him, waiters can't serve him
# Mike Jordan of rap - outside J workin
# Now watch how quickly I drop 50
# I don't like playin, niggaz can't stick me
# Niggaz can not jam me, niggaz can't get me
# Slimmy at the Rucka wanna leave and spend with me
# I consistantly take em out the park like Ken Griffey
# Do you believe? It's Hova the God
# [Pain In Da Ass]
# Makes you think about the people in your life
# Then I think about BIG; what'd he say if he was here
# He'd say, "Jay, what's it about? What's life about?
# If you don't go through as a man's a man"
# He'd say, "Suck it up, take the fall, do the time
# that's what makes you who you are, makes you what you are"
# How many years you been around this thing of ours?
# Commision, 125 years
# What's it about?
# It's about rules, parameters
# You take the beatin for the friend you don't lay down
# you don't betray who you are, what you are
# You gotta remember guys like Taj, Chill, Ran, Emory
# They don't roar, they don't rap
# You know why? That's the rules, you don't break them
# You was born to be somethin I wasn't even supposed to be.. humble
# Okaay so you humble me now, what you got?
# You got a war, you got global war
# You got a worldwide crime syndicate now
# There's no rules, there's no parameters, there's no feelings
# There's no feelings for this game
# So.. five ten years from now
# You're gonna wish there was American Commision
# Five ten years from now...
# They're gonna miss Jay-Z
# Oahhhkayyyyy, I'm reloaded!!!!!

# Used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane
# Duckin the plain cops, pushin indo and 'caine
# At the kitchen table late night, no pen, just my brain
# First album niggaz love me cause they thought I was poor
# Guess I'm successful; industry don't love me no more
# Well I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubblin raw
# Skully tilted, pants saggin, damn near touchin the floor
# And I come with do-rags to your so-called awards
# T-shirt with my chain out like fuck y'all all
# Retrospect ain't been the same since I lost my dad
# He's still alive, but still fuck you, don't cross my path
# A&R's had me feelin like moss in the drab
# So I turned the league out with "Reasonable Doubt"
# Get your CD's out, let's go, song for song
# I'm the illest nigga doin it til y'all prove me wrong

# If you did it I done it before, you get I had it

# And that goes for everything from flippin that raw

# how there's people in the world who wouldn't want me as a neighbor
# Has to explain to her, you think these folks want me in the penthouse
# as a reminder that I make top paper?
# Black entrepeneur, nobody did us no favors
# Nobody gave us shit, we made us
# The Rap Pack, I'm Sinatra, Dame's Sam Davis
# Big's the smart one on the low like Dean Martin
# We came in this game, not beggin niggaz pardon
# Demandin y'all respect, hand over a check
# And while y'all at it, hand over the jet
# We the reason they ain't hand over Def Jam so quick
# They new every year I was droppin new product
# I was raisin the stock up, while buildin the Roc up
# But that's alright, cause they knew they had to see us
# When it was time for us to re-up, make us multi-million-ires
# Je-je-jeah!
# (And more, much more than this; I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy)
# Jeah! "In My Lifetime"
# I caught smaller cases, but I had capital
# Hypocritic system let me right back at you
# You better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
# Not even that scratches you, 'specially if you black dude
# They don't give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
# And they can look good by paintin him as bad news
# Cause in my past, I seen dudes get half of they views
# exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
# So imagine how disturbed I was
# When I seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
# Let me explain exactly how this shit was
# This nigga Un yo I scratched him, he went home without an aspirin
# But it's cool cause he's back friends, and half-inning is over
# It's in the past and I'm glad, now I'm back to bein Hova
# Me back with the chaffeur, laid back
# Helicopter seat, feat inclined, shit feelin like a sofa
# Helicopter meet me, Teta Vero(?) take me over
# somewhere peaceful for the weekend now it's back to speakin of vultures
# So the next time that page six approaches us

# Momma I made it
# Ya'll know how I do when the Doc do it
# I fly thru it
# That's how I operated
# Momma I made it
# Ghetto like the grease when you getting your hair braided
# Sweeter than your sister Kool Aid is
# Hooray is the underdog
# Now my feet under desk
# It's the presidential favorite
# Can't believe I got away with my earlier stages
# Being on stages

# I'm a hold the fam down at least 3 generations
# I'm talking when spaceships are around
# And ya great, great grands
# Reminiscing about foundation you gave 'em
# For repairing my relationship with my pops before he passed
# All I ask is you raise your glass for this celebration
# Toast to the most beautiful girl in the world
# My inspiration, thanks for your information
# [Chorus:]
# Momma I made it [x2]
# [Verse 2:]
# I'm in BK where
# It ain't everyday that you make it out
# To be on top of yachts waving
# I remember you saving for the light bill
# Paid the rent with a light bill
# Now my crib dark as a basement
# And you'd lock up the when you wasn't home
# We was communicating like the money you made wasn't basic
# Our cable was basic
# No HBO, no WHT
# Just Ralph McDaniels on the station
# I aggravated you for Atari and Coleco Vision
# Pinstripe Lee's when the first day day of school came
# I was OK with not having everything as long as Saturdays
# You had the Commodores playing
# The expression on your face was priceless
# It's still with me till this day
# Baby girl I won't erase it
# I go to my grave with the memory of the sacrifice you made
# You deserve a standing ovation
# Momma I made it
# [Chorus x3]

# Now your lil misfit makes sure every day is Christmas
# Write down your wish list
# Sixes, wrist is glistening
# You don't even like jewels
# But you can missing anywhere you like to
# Where the water's light tube
# Anything you order, sign it to your nice room
# Leave an extra tip Ma

# Wow I know pop's looking down
# I know Colleek somewhere up in the clouds
# Like go get 'em Grandma, make me proud
# Didn't have a man in the house so you made one
# So I act like ya husband and I'm only ya son
# I told you one day I'll get you a home
# But I didn't know it would possibly be in Rome
# She told me don't wait on nobody
# Get your own, so with me myself & my microphone I made it

# If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin
# My motto is simply I will not lose
# Abide by the block rules, I buy my glocks used
# wit bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
# I'm raised, illrational, way misunderstood
# If you ain't live like I live, been one with the hood
# I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
# Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature
# If hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin with the razors
# Still flashin ya shit, try to pass me in a six
# Type classy on the wrists, every bit of 30 karats
# This is, not a game this is not why I came
# May these words find a spot on your brain and burn

# I will never tell even if it means sittin in a cell
# I ain't never ran, never will
# I ain't never been smacked; a nigga better keep his hands
# to himself or get clapped for what's under that man's belt
# I never asked for nothin I don't demand of myself
# Honesty, loyalty, friends and then wealth
# Death before dishonor and I tell you what else
# I tighten my belt 'fore I beg for help
# Foolish pride is what held me together through the years
# I wasn't felt which is why I ain't never played myself
# I just play the hand I'm dealt, I can't say I've never knelt
# before God and asked for better cards at times to no avail
# But I never sat back feelin sorry for myself
# If you don't give me heaven I'll raise hell

# Story of a champion, sorry I'm a champion
# You lost one
# My nephew died in the car I bought
# So I'm under the belief it's partly my fault
# Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
# Place any burden on me, but please, not that lord
# Time don't go back, it go forward
# Can't run from the pain, go towards it
# Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
# Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit
# Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
# 'til that time, little man I'm nauseous
# Your girlfriend's pregnant, the lord's gift
# Almost lost my faith, that restored it
# It's like having your life restarted
# Can't wait for your child's life, to be a part of it
# So now I'm child-like, waiting for a gift
# To return, when I lost you, I lost it
# Lose one, let go to get one

# Rain grey skies, seems at the end of every
# young black life is this line, "Damn - him already?
# Such a good kid," got us pourin Henn' already
# Liquor to the curb for my, niggaz up above
# When it, cracks through the pavement that's my way of sendin love
# So, give Big a hug, tell Aa-liyah I said hi
# 'Til the next time I see her, on the other side
# He was just some thug that, caught some slugs
# And we loved him cause, in him we, saw some of us
# He walked like ussss, talked like ussss
# His back against the wall, nigga fought like us - damn
# Poor Isis, that's his momma name
# Momma ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name?

# Daddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him
# Isis blamin herself, she wish she coulda saved him
# Damn near impossible, only men can raise men
# He was his own man, not even him can save him
# He put his faith in her, thirty-eight in his waist
# But when you live by the gun you die by the same fate
# End up, dead before thirty-eight and umm
# That's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world
# Old girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away
# Isis, life just, ended on that rainy day
# When she got the news her boy body could be viewed
# down at the City Morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude
# Her addiction grew, prescription drugs, shift and brew
# Angel dust, dipped in WOO!
# She slipped into, her own fantasy world
# Had herself pregnant by a different dude
# But reality bites and, this is her life
# He wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife
# It was just this night when, moon was full
# And the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight
# Had her soundin like Lisa Lisa - I wonder if I take you home
# will you still love me after this night?
# Mike was the hardhead from the around the way
# that she wanted all her life, shit she wanted all the hype
# Used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike
# He was a Willie all her life he wasn't really the one to like
# It was a, dude named Shy who would really treat her right
# He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
# But I-sis, like this, Broadway life
# She loved the Gucci sneakers, the red green and whites
# Hangin out the window when she first seen him fight
# She was so turned on that she had to shower twice
# How ironic it would, be some fight that
# turned into a homicide that'll alter their life
# See Mike at thirty-two was still on the scene
# Had a son fifteen that he never saw twice
# Sure he saw him as an infant, but he dissed on him like
# "If that was my son, he would look much different.
# See I'm light-skinnded and that baby there's dark
# so it's, momma's baby; poppa's maybe."
# Mike was still crazy out there runnin the streets (fuck niggaz want?)
# Had an older but light with thirty-eight gun in his reach
# It's been fourteen years, him and Isis ain't speak
# He runnin around like life's a peach, 'til one day
# he approached this thug that, had a mean mug
# And it looked so familiar that he called him "Young Cuz"
# Told him, get off the strip but the boy ain't budge (fuck you)
# Instead he pulled out a newer thirty-eight snub
# He clearly had the drop but the boy just paused (hold up)
# There was somethin in this man's face he knew he seen before
# It's like, lookin in the mirror seein hisself more mature
# And he took it as a sign from the almighty Lord
# You know what they say about he who hesitates in war
# (What's that?) He who hesitates is lost
# He can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank
# The old man didn't think he just followed his instinct
# Six shots into his kid, out of the gun
# Niggaz be a father, you're killin your son
# Six shots into his kid, out of the gun

# Didn't cry
# Didn't know him that well
# Between him doin Heroine
# And me doin Crack sales
# With that in the egg shell
# Standin at the tabernacle
# Rather the church
# Pretending to be hurt
# Wouldn't work
# So a smirk was all on my face
# Like damn that mans face was just like my face
# So pop i forgive you
# For all the shit that i live through
# It wasn't all your fault
# Homie you got caught
# And to the same game i fault
# That Uncle Ray lost
# My big brothers and so many others i saw
# I'm just glad we got to see each other
# Talk and re-meet each other
# Save a place in Heaven
# Til the next time we meet forever

# The music business hate me
# Cause the industry ain't make me
# Hustlers and boosters embrace me
# And the music i be makin
# I dumb down for my audience
# And double my dollars
# They criticize me for it
# Yet they all yell "Holla"
# If skills sold
# Truth be told
# I'd probably be

# Truthfully
# I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
# (But i did five Mil)
# I ain't been rhymin like Common Sense
# When your sense got that much in common
# And you been hustlin since
# Your inception
# Fuck perception
# Go with what makes sense
# Since
# I know what i'm up against
# We as rappers must decide what's most impor-tant
# And i can't help the poor if i'm one of them
# So i got rich and gave back
# To me that's the win, win
# The next time you see the homie and his rims spin
# Just know my mind is workin just like them
# (The rims that is)
# [Chorus]
# [Verse Three]
# My homie Sigel's on a tier
# Where no tears should fall
# Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
# See in my inner circle all we do is ball
# Til we all got triangles on our wall
# He ain't just rappin for the platinum
# Yall record

# Cause i really been there before
# Four scores and seven years ago
# Prepared to flow
# Prepare for war

# Just stay busy, stay workin

# The key to staying, on top of things
# is treat everything like it's your first project, knahmsayin?
# Like it's your first day like back when you was an intern
# Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry

# Uhh, uhh, yes, yes
# Y'all wanna know, why he don't stop
# Y'all wanna know, why he don't flop
# Let me tell you pe-eople why
# Came from the bottom of the block I
# When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit
# Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
# Had to get my ri-ide on
# Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to
# Had to had to get these chips
# Had to make moves like Olajuwon
# Started out sellin dimes and nicks
# Graduated to a brick
# No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip
# Legendary like a schoolboy
# Crushin merely nearly every every chick
# Heavy shit - that's how schoolboy got whipped
# And got left on some "Just +Me, Myself and I+"
# On some Trugoy shit
# Had your boys threw place up, to a place of no return
# Had to play with fire and get burned
# Only way the boy ever gon' learn
# Had to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn
# Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned
# [Chorus]
# It's my life - it's my pain and my struggle
# The song that I sing to you it's my ev-ery-thing
# Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
# And my thirst is the same as - when I came
# It's my joy and my tears and the laughter it brings to me
# It's my ev-ery-thing
# [Verse Two: Jay-Z]
# Like I never rode in a limo
# Like I just dropped flows to a demo
# Like it's ninety-two again and
# And I got O's in the rental
# Back in the Stu' again, no prob' livin was a whole lot simpler
# When you think back, you thought that
# you would never make it this far, then you
# take advantage of the luck you handed
# Or the talent, you been given
# Ain't no, half steppin, ain't no, no slippin
# Ain't no different from a block that's hidden
# Gotta get it while the getting's good
# Gotta strike while the iron's hot, 'fore you stop
# Then you gotta bid it, good riddance
# Goodbye, this is my second major breakup
# My first was, with a pager
# With a hooptie, a cookpot, and the GAME
# This one's with the stool, with the stage, with the fortune
# Maybe not the fortune, but certainly the FAME
# [Chorus]
# It's my life - my pain and my struggle
# The song that I sing to you it's my ev-ery-thing
# Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
# And my thirst is the same as - when I came
# It's my joy and my tears and my laughter it brings to me

# Bitches wanna push my world, they flash box
# 160, push my wheel, mash cops
# Cause 160 took my wheel to cash drop
# Run 60, you Big Will, match cop
# Lookin through the rearview and Mac was wylin
# New driver, screwdriver, the cracked steering column
# Pushin somethin stolen, blastin, picture me rollin
# Baghdad, couldn't picture me ??
# Now the truth different, Mac come through Coupe roof missin
# I'm the truth til my fuckin roof missin
# Mac stay stuck in the Coupe to school pigeons
# Feathers gettin plucked in the truck from loose chickens, listen
# [Chorus]
# [Memphis Bleek]
# Yo, aiyyo I dip dip dive, what can I say?
# I can't fit 'em all inside the Escalade
# So I called up, murder to further my parkin lot pimpin
# Told 'em get the Impala so I can start dippin
# Lay back, seat recline, they notice the hand
# Car movin slow, driven by the invisible man
# Everything on the dash, digital and
# I got a fast stashbox don't make me spit at you man
# In the parkin lot, where I spark a lot
# I come to show my new feet, slide off with a few freaks

# "Man I worked for one of the biggest companies in New York City.
# He didn't own his own company. White man owned it, so they owned him. Nobody owns me though."
# (Your gangster is not defined)
# Your gangster is not defined by how low your jeans fall by your waist, but more how your genes stand over his expectations. Never forget where you came from.
# (Your gangster)
# Your gangster is not defined by how many rocks are in your watch, but rather how many rocks you move while on your watch.
# (Gangsters, hustlers, republicans, democrats, pimps and hoes.)
# Conservatives, labor, the seller, the buyer, the product, the producer.
# (See you are what you are in this world.)
# The gangster is absorbed and adored by those that don't understand the laws that govern gangsterment.
# (Gangsterment)
# Gangsterment allows you to make up your own laws and create brand new words.
# Gangster mentality.
# (Gangster mentality, an American way created by the white, mastered by the black, and absorbed by the fiends, taxed by the governmentality, charted by
# forbes. If you believe in Jay-Z then you too can be a gangster.)
# The you too can be a gangster by any means necessary. By any means necessary, by owning that dream. I mean it's a long walk to freedom but, while deep,
# deep, deep inside the bush.
# (The war on terror screams, damn it feels good)
# Damn it feels good to be a gangster.
# (To be a gangster swagger is not a must, it's a liability, a cliche, a bad suit, cut the bullshit. You know if it wasn't for this, there would be no that.)
# Which we call, the American Gangster.

# And I do it twice, ain't no sense in me

# I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
# I got a hustler spirit, nigga period
# Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
# Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer
# No matter where you go, you are what you are player
# And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
# Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
# Only God can judge me, so I'm gone

# I give you the news - with a twist it's just his ghetto point-of-view
# The renegade; you been afraid
# I penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they

# Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
# Mommy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over
# Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
# No he's not around - now how that sound to ya, jot it down
# I bring it through the ghetto without ridin 'round
# hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
# Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
# How you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it?
# I help them see they way through it - not you
# Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
# Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt

# But I'm debated disputed hated and viewed in America
# as a motherfuckin drug addict - like you didn't experiment?
# Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror

# The game is fucked up
# Niggas beats is banging

# Being intricate
# Get you wood critics

# Nigga that's good business
# Forget this rap shit
# I need a new hustle
# A lil bit of everything
# The new improved rustle
# I say that reluctantly cause I do struggle
# As you see I can't leave
# So I do love you
# But I'm just a hustler disguised as a rapper
# In fact you can't fit this hustle inside of a wrapper
# Back when crack was what these pills are
# I was a real star
# Complete with real cars
# No video ones
# You can come, set up a camera and let the video run
# And my real life
# Complete with real ice
# VVS boulders all invisibly set
# Head and shoulders
# My invisible neck
# You see HOVA wasn't digital yet
# Before Steve Jobs made the iPod
# I was getting head jobs
# We call that intimate
# Back when rappers wouldn't dare play
# Lyrical roulette
# With an automatic weapon
# I was repping with a Tech
# Fresh like Manny be
# Chain like antifreeze
# Shoebox full of cash
# Dealer man hand me keys
# Pantries full of Arm & Hammer
# Don't take Nancy Drew to see
# What it do, I'm a damn G
# Just sent a million dollars through a hands free
# That's big money talk, can you answer me
# Before the answer was a 3
# I was down in Georgetown
# With a Hoya bitch, lawyer bitch
# Sure he's rich now
# Cause he saw this shit, all this shit
# That's why they call him HOV
# Cause he came before all this shit
# Bought a 6, quarter seven
# Skipped on them quarter eights
# Bought a Nine from nonstop clock work
# All the time
# Guess who's back
# Since this is a new era
# I gotta fresh new hat
# 10-year veteran
# I been said I been through
# With this bullsh*t game but I never can
# I used to think rapping at 38 was ill
# But last year alone I grossed 38 mill
# I know I ain't quite 38 but still

# But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
# The pride and the pain
# All the way back from the rise of my name
# See the world clear through the eyes of the mane
# See the world chear for the rhymes that I gave

# It turn traumatic teens into addicts, and fiends
# It's like, watchin a movie through a panoramic screen
# Which means, I can see the whole planet in the scene
# Cash is the topic, the object, a fatter pocket
# Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it
# take away the added profit, it's catastrophic
# I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it
# These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
# The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me

# Defy Webster's words they can't pronounce like that
# That's why no other rapper got a sound like that
# Trap, trap of my life
# Flashback, kill niggaz
# Rap skills unmatched, Jigga man baby
# I can't entertain it sometimes I can't explain it
# God given, gifts of a soul for hard living
# Far be it from me to question Allah's wisdom
# Could've been lost in the system
# Instead I'm involved with the rhythm
# I dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions
# I know I must be part of some mission
# Shit I used take it for granted
# Why they placed me on this planet
# I would ask myself while writin raps to myself
# But right there under my nose
# Was the flow of all flows
# Not a demon but a rose in the cement, come on

# Uh, uh, come on

# You thug look at what you make the clubs do
# You know the flow Jigga know
# Sicka flow
# You know what me and Swizz's shit sound like
# Crazed and demonic, uh without blazing chronic
# Product of Reaganomics
# You know that muthafuckin' stoop raised me
# Ringin' in da hoops but I was too lazy
# School made me sick, teachers said I was too crazy
# Low and behold, it's the new and improved Jay-Z
# Let me explain it's the you baby
# I spent nights out, days in
# Niggaz was blazing, twelve noon where I was raised in
# I felt caged in but kept roaming
# Prayed for the Day of Atonement
# Married to the streets no date of annulment
# It seems every time it comes up
# They postpone it
# So I kept my chrome at the waist
# Waiting for the omen
# Savoring the moment and now you know
# The reason that I flow the way I flow baby
# (Jay-Z)
# It's the things that you do
# (Uh, inhale, exhale, breathe on it)
# That make me feel soft
# And I don't know the way I feel

# Geah.. whassup?
# Where's all my street niggaz, project niggaz
# Real niggaz, worldwide
# Let's reflect.. e'rybody got a story
# We all ghetto B - here's mine
# Geah
# See I was -- born in sewage, born to make bomb music
# Flow tight like I was born Jewish
# Used the streets as a conduit - I kept arms
# 38 longs inside my mom's Buick
# At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news
# Iron cuffs - arms through it; or stuffed with embalmin fluid
# Shit, I'm goin through it - mom dukes too
# Tears streamin down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
# My life is gettin too wild
# I need to bring some sort kinda calm to it
# Bout to lose it; voices screamin "Don't do it!"
# It's like '93, '94, bout the year
# that Big and Mag dropped; and "Illmatic" rocked
# outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked
# Everybody doin 'em, I'm still scratchin on the block
# like "Damn; I'ma be a failure"
# Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug - paraphenalia
# Cops courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
# Three time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
# Tryin figure where your mail is, guesstimate the weight you sellin
# So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!
# It gets worse, baby momma water burst
# Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on
# Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb
# Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be -- soon
# [Chorus: Jay-Z]
# This can't be life, this can't be love
# This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
# This can't be life, this can't be love
# This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

# Chill dog
# Second oldest born, from Michelle Brown my mother
# Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother
# Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another
# I'm thinkin damn; how my older sister gon' make me tougher
# When steel sharpens steel, I'ma keep it real
# I'm tired of tryin to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills
# Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real
# Y'all niggaz thinkin what y'all readin in The Source is real
# What my life like, you lookin at the source, it's real
# What your life like? Mine dog, of course it's real
# Passin judgment, you niggaz second-guessin Beans
# Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Amin
# Dog you know a couple suras, out the Qur'an
# I guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine
# Stop that Akki, 'fore I send shots though your body
# Make 'em feel feel hell on earth before Allah drop thee
# I feel the line's drawn here, nuttin more can stop me
# Till them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me
# There's only three things that make Mac not act like Beans
# Amatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin
# My seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave dog
# Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave dog
# I come back in the afterlife
# Like fuck it I done touched hell twice; what's the meanin?
# [Chorus]
# [Scarface]
# Yeah.. uhh..
# Now as I walk into the studio, to do this with Jig'
# I got a phone call from one of my nigs
# Said my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids
# And when I heard that I just broke into tears
# And see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is
# But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib
# So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news
# Now we both depressed, countin our blessings cause Brad's two
# Prayin for young souls to laugh atlife through the stars
# Lovin your kids just like you was ours
# And I'm hurtin for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours
# I just know that heaven'll open these doors
# And ain't no bright side to losin lifel; but you can view it like this
# God's got open hands homey, he in the midst.. of good company
# Who loves all and hates not one
# And one day you gon' be wit your son
# I could've rapped about my hard times on this song
# But heaven knows I woulda been wrong
# I wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love
# It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us
# This can't be life

# Rehabilitated, man I still feel hatred
# I'm young black and rich so they wanna strip me naked, but
# You never had me like Christina Aguiler-y
# But catch me down the Westside, drivin like Halle Berry
# Or the FDR, in the seat of my car
# Screamin out the sunroof death to y'all
# You can't kill me, I live forever through these bars
# I put the wolves on ya, I put a price on your head
# The whole hood'll want ya, you startin to look like bread
# I send them boys at ya, I ain't talkin bout Feds
# Nigga them body-snatchers, nigga you heard what I said

# Futuristic shit beeotch
# Uh, what the fuck? How we do. How we do. Uh ha
# [Verse 1:]
# Triple platnum nigga with the solid gold fade
# All that nickle and dime shit, don't hold no weight
# Fortune 5, top 5 in the Forbes (you'll see) as you
# Thumb through the Source I read the Ride report

# My people's eyes through the peep hole
# I'm lovin' you down freak as I
# Shoot through the city like a rumor
# Not soon enough, to stop 'em from spreadin' the news
# Paper headin' read "Jay-Z breaths, 80 degrees"
# the only thing to cool them off is a Malibu day breeze
# Can't sop for the feds, say cheese
# You know they wanna take a nigga picture
# Pray for the day to get ya, but I'm a parlay and stay richer for now
# Jigga hasn't done dirt in a while
# YOu know my stomach getin' weak from livin' on the streets for real
# Tryin' to oversee it from suites, orderin' eats
# At the top where the criminal minds meet
# That's where the cream is (right) , that's where your dream is (well ain't

# After the party it's the Waffle House
# If you ever been here you know what I'm talkin about
# Where people don't dance all they do is this
# And after the original you know what it is
# Welcome to Atlanta

# Remix it had to go down
# I got somethin else to tell you 'bout the new Motown
# Where people don't visit, they move out here
# And ain't no tellin who you might see up in Lennox Square
# I don't know about you but I miss the FreakNic
# Cause that's where my city use to be real sick
# People from other cities use to drive from miles
# Just to come to get a taste of this A.T.L style
# I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballin-ist Player
# Make my own moves, call me the mayor
# Monday night you know things change with time
# Magic City back lookin like eighty-nine
# All the homies on the southside up in the Ritz
# Tuesday night, the Velvet Room same shit
# Wednesday Strokers I don't go no mo'
# Cause they don't know how to treat you when you come through the do'
# Thursday night, was Plush but we moved to fuel
# And I be up in the booth drunk actin a fool
# Friday night, at Kaya they still got love
# And the Sharkbar we poppin like it's a night club

# [Jean's alter ego talking]
# Hey boy, you know sometimes when two people are in love
# They just can't seem to get it together
# And that's how I feel about you
# [Jean Grae]
# He already knew I was down for the cause
# But hard to get is much more fun
# What's better than that really?
# Son was like feel me?
# I was all Nah
# Catchin' feelings truly upset when he had to go
# And school me on ways of catchin a mate, god
# I'm matchin' a date cuz I'm lackin skills
# Smaller than an Ipod
# I'm kiddin I know the mackin is rules
# Was tackin on the wifey latch since backpackin in school
# But he's different though I feel him mo
# Can't play it simple, No!
# Can't fuck up the friendship for them dimples, Nope!
# I need to enter his space and probe his INTERSCOPE
# Just like im vanity lookin for his inner glow
# He's not a BAD BOY, never sampled his type before
# Moved to New York from Los Angeles
# Cali Swagger ain't attached to nothin
# We puffin analyzing the city after he's rollin somethin
# I wanna ROCK A FELLA so bad, oh man
# Note pad filled with all the ink his soul had
# Visions of us. Kissin the whole nine
# No JIVE could picture his whole profile
# But I can't sleep, I risk the chance of losin everything
# A friendship is more important than a wedding ring
# Now he's callin me I keep actin SHADY
# And lately screenin all his calls to escape
# He keepin my heart safely tucked in, but I can't function
# Until the AFTERMATH of our conjunctions passed
# Punkin out, Im duckin out his way
# Can't look him in the face, eyes drippin with game
# My mind is trippin again, damn
# [Jean's alter ego Talking]
# You got me goin crazy
# I think I, I think I love you
# But
# [Jean Grae talking]
# Maybe it just shouldn't be us two
# Maybe I'm just not the one who's right you know
# And maybe we can't be together tonight
# Or maybe it's just not good
# I mean, maybe you just need another girl
# Maybe I can't just be in your world
# Maybe we just can't be together
# For you, whatever
# [Jean's alter ego talking]
# Boy you got me going crazy
# Should we be lovers
# Should we be friends
# I just wanna be with you, until the end
# [Jean Grae]
# I Jean Grae solemly need this Fresh to death man
# Even blind girls can see that he's DEF JAM
# I'm in this UNIVERSAL problem
# Y'all can probably relate, y'all follow then
# So do I give my lovin to him?
# Or would that just ruin everything that we're about
# I'm so attached to him
# He knows the way I am, tempers un-godly so
# Domestic violence could turn to me on DEATH ROW
# He's so persistant with it, we're makin out again
# We double datin, out with one of his COLUMBIA friends
# He didn't graduate, Son makes him feel shitty
# We leave the place, and run hand in hand around the city
# He leans in kisses me, his G UNIT shiftly
# My mind is ? movin into ecstasy
# His warmth next to me, now we're all neckin
# Layin in his arms affection
# [Jean Grae talking]
# Maybe it should be us two together
# And maybe I'm the one for you forever
# Or maybe we we're suppose to be together tonight
# And maybe everything is just right
# And maybe I'm your love until the end of time
# And maybe I'm suppose to be yours, and you mine
# And maybe It's just alright
# And for you still, whatever
# [Jean's alter ego talking]
# Well I guess I, I guess I was the one for you
# This is beautiful, Just us together forever and ever and ever
# Can I get you anything?
# Do you need some weed?
# A backrub?
# A slice of cake?
# I'd do anything for you boy
# Anything, anything
# Except for that

# I see you're still artistic, talented
# Vicky listen
# I did some foul shit to you
# Even though it's passed
# I vow to you apologies a thousand times
# How could you, even look me in the eye then
# You're a bigger person then I ever was
# Or at least I'm trying
# I should of never touched 'em
# We should of never crushed and
# Then straight lied to your face about it
# No trace of blushing
# But I was young and stupid
# Shooting all crooked and keep it fucking up a friendship
# For some ass, should of never pursued it
# Just wanted to thank you for understanding and reaching out
# Love Jean, holla back at your homie, peace, I'm out
# (Chorus)
# P.S. just had to get this offa my chest
# I hope you're well, I really wish you the best
# And as you can tell i've done alot of growing up
# And time goes fast and no sign of slowing up
# So if its any consolation karma got me bad
# And anything I did wrong I wish I never had
# I hope that all this drama we can leave in the past
# Please feel free to write back
# (Verse 2)
# Hey marshall
# I pray to god this is your email
# Or else someone is gonna read alot of details
# I hope you're doing well, matter a fact I know that you are
# Probably married, pickett fence, kids, well, best regards
# You always had it in you
# Motivated, studious, impervious to outside influences that can ruin it
# Anyways listen
# I tried to reach out before
# On the first record number 8, fuck it
# It was hardly in stores, 2 days still
# I bet you moved far from us
# It was a long time ago, about five summers
# I just wanted to say I'm sorry, sorry for cheating
# Sorry I wasnt honest, it wasnt a good reason
# You probably dont care but I still mean it
# Still put it in the air and hope that you feel that I'm being sincere
# You didnt deserve a broken heart
# And I wish you the world
# Love Jean, scream later at your girl
# (Chorus)
# (Verse 3)
# Dear Jean
# I see you're doing big things
# Congratulations hey I even saw that big ring
# Who would of thunk it huh? L-O-L
# You even seem content
# I notice that you're more focus
# Drinking less is well
# Anyways its been too many months having henny days
# I think is plenty grave, plus you get your penny saved up
# And say what?!? second album
# Whatever happened to the thought of edging rapping
# Still living in Manhattan?
# Side tracking note, just on the low
# All apologies, I used to hate your fucking guts
# Please pardon me, tried to kill you more than once
# I've acted horribly, and all my pessemism towards your life
# Still bothers me
# But you're a big girl now
# You've fought and made it through
# Best of luck homie
# And everything I say is true
# XOXO space smiley face dot dot dot comma much love, Hugh
# (Chorus)
# Ah cap locks, delete

# And the fifth for these funny niggaz; Dave Chappelle
# When Run-DMC was fuckin' Raising Hell
# I was on the run from d's, these raised in hell
# Kinda broke, couldn't raise the bell

# With rap, you can sing such amazing tales, nigga
# Ya'll niggaz bust my web, heat pop

# "And I'ma get mad deep like a threat!" - GZA
# [Verse 1]
# No where to go and I be flowing, try to flow and then before
# Back in the day when I was cool, I couldn't afford to be a guru
# On ya case like your lawyer, think you run, you mistaken
# Put all records to the side, and it's ya face I'm fuckin' breaking
# Awaken and await, and take the shit like amoebas
# I'm rollin' with stowin' Tim, gas rack, that's where the heaters
# We just wreckin', what the fuck was you expectin' from a minor
# Put a bullet through ya chest, and see who next to rap behind ya
# Straight up and down, y'all a sermon and blew it
# I half niggaz wildin', as if they smokin' a gallon of embalmin' fluid
# Drillin' and wanna be fit, like something shrimp on the barbie
# I do my dirt up in Philly, chill in the hills, where other gods guard me
# Thinkin' that's going thru my hood, like I chew it
# Comin' in with this other pussy, I smoke ya then rejuice ya
# Crucify ya, I fuckin' rhyme ya, now I'ma fuckin' shoot ya
# My bone is hard as stone, cause I got blowjob from Medusa
# [Verse 2]
# The beat addict, I'm crushin' MC's who cause static
# Pen tips the pad, I touch stars in the attic
# The dopest that wrote this, when suckas provoke this
# Now it's the time for perpetrators to quote this
# Rhyme that I wrote for heads to get loose to
# I blow up spots like snots in a tissue
# I dissed you, dismissed, but suckas persist to
# Bite my flow, so now you know --
# That when I rip up a set, I get mad deep
# Don't sleep, or you and ya whole crew can get beat
# As I'm waxin', taxin', a dope reaction
# Bitches who front, get reduced like fractions
# So ya motherfuckin' flex to vex, whose next in line
# To recline, and steal my lines, so check it
# Now the man ya facin', ya rhymes I'm erasin'
# If you drip or get slipped, I convict like Perry Mason

# Meet ya makers, ya fakers and immitators
# I'm greater cause I do my best work on paper
# Mad raps, raps the disaster from the masters
# Snatchin' up rappers, and takin' out actors
# He can test, skippin' yet, don't pass the limit
# You finished, so save the Die Hard image for Bruce Willis
# Ya raps are a joke, but I put dope from start
# Transform with the art, rippin' ya fuckin' mics apart
# This is the rawest of words of you ever heard
# My rap style superb, gettin' nursed in the curb
# It can't compete with the man when I freak it
# The crew will get beat quick, so stay in ya seat bitch
# Rhymes I wreck or perfect, and correct lyrically
# Too complex, who ya punks to step
# Yo, I be rhymin' hits whenever it's time to flip quick
# A writer's block non-stop, and I'ma get --
> Jedi Mind Tricks
# [Verse 1]
# Word is bond, rock on, my diatribe will swarm and persevere
# Emcee's will disappear, they will fear what is here
# And that is sadistic, with linguistic rhyme penetrating
# Upsided the mind like the burn, of jack of lantern
# Attack this, when I smack kids with my tactics
# Kill it over patriots, if you assemble the wackness
# Sprayin' off the majestic rays, that knowns the writing
# A slide gets ride, and crucified, like punch of Titan
# Narcotic, on point, mentality, battle me
# Knocking herbs up out the galaxy, fantasies
# I break neck with my kendo's, can't do fool
# Understand, how my chant goes, swift dialetic
# Cybernatics, my aparatus
# If throw more morphic styles, I break, tragic records
# Eratic, catchable t's, I breeze through
# This degree of emcee's, as they seize to
# Amaze, how these dudes get with that wack rap
# Fourty ounce fat caps, and raps in my napsack
# Flaudelant emcee's get burned by the lighter
# You don't know the half, cause soul crash my cipher
# [Verse 2]
# Superstar I jaw the first, we rush last and touch pie
# The proof is my man suscribe, to that old school vibe
# Yo, make shift that the man, is quick to jive
# I grab I to that branch with force and pride
# Steady straws are the prime fact', to fly back as I somersault
# Far sing forever, as superstruct for that mass
# Pa' ark with forty bullet ---
# Throwin' my fake feed light like blastin' bullets
# Through the flame, pushin' fog out the mass way
# Catch a five thick, vinyl ain't the number in my ash tray
# The charts slumber, if expect
# I take all that masking kids, and watch them in our record
# Though I fly were you fish, like bass, trout, the fresh water
# Now it's floatin' like prada in a metro
# Every large animal stole ours, but fresh crews?
# I'm comin' off like a bad weave
# I pertrude to retreave the last star
# From the full mouth, with no fingers to the fence
# I commence to grab the foul cinder block route
# Then how many times before, so I grout
# Pushin' much more..
# [Verse 3]
# Ills I be droppin' like an expert, insert the clip
# And let off the best ease off, I givin' dirt naps
# The last law of any ferry
# Weak minded foes get bloated like surgery
# You never heard of me, you new comer, straight done up
# Hit you with a verse, because I'm evil with my lethal
# Vocabulary, spark a spliff, it's very necessery
# So ease up or get caught up in the cemetary
# Understand and prepare ya mind, it's realness
# Unpredictable skills, that's build, so just chill, kid

# Yeah
# Jedi mind baby

# Junkyard Dog, real dirty and mean
# Take your face off cousin, I'm a surgery fiend

# And when there's beef with the heat they don't want what
# You just waiting for the bomb to reign
# put your body in the whole like Saddam Hussein
# So guard your frame when the .45 shells drop
# Cause it's dark and it's hot like in hell hot
# Vinnie Paz on some other shit
# I like my gat chrome, back bone and a rubber grip
# Licking' shots at the government

# This is for my man Yan
# Listen I 'aint gonna play no more
# Beat a faggit till he 'aint fucking gay no more
# We 'gon stay making hits this is infinite
# This is Vinnie Paz world, you just live in it
# You just living in my world of doom
# Until Jedi Mind decide to build your tomb
# I build with goons, build with brother that's hustling leak
# And there 'aint nobody that's raw'r then us on the beat
# Ain't nobody Raw'r then Paz-man
# Cause I can drop a motherfucking bomb on you like the Gatban
# We coming strapped man, its a war cousin
# Hit you with the Ric Flair figure four cousin
# Barry Windham right hand to your jaw cousin
# Road Warriors, Animal and Hawk cousin
# Take a walk cousin, 'cause I'm done wit' you
# Or you'll be looking down the barrel of a gun or two
# [Vinnie Paz]
# I'm coming for your head
# Like something from the dawn of the dead
# Vito Corleone style, horse on a bed
# Thoughts on a bed from a hallow tip
# Chop off your fucking tongue make you swallow it
# You the type that got and what's to do diallo hit
# The type to make you faggot and be proud of it
# Turn it down a bit I can't think daddy
# I think I need another motherfucking drink daddy
# I think I'll hit the fucking bar with King Size
# Whose these motherfuckers dressing in pink guys
# You a retard, claims to be street smart
# But you the first one to run when the beef start
# You fucking sweetheart, you're in the wrong game
# Beat your head 'till your dead with a long chain
# Jedi Mind Tricks gonna have a long reign

# [Chorus 2X: sample]
# "One two three
# Let me you, if you ready for me, lord"
# [Verse 1]
# It's the infinite connect
# Respect what you see as if you praise Donald Chief
# And understand my plan is to prosper till deceased
# And let my bank account increase until it over flows
# In pathfinder jeeps, organized and blunt patrol
# And never indulge in petty shit that's irrelevant
# Thousand dollar shopping sprees just for the hell of it
# Drinkin' daquiri's in the back of caravans
# And finally got the chance to live my lifestyle advanced
# And keep my mind clear of poisonous stunts and beams
# Be deep meditations, now I see where pagans dream
# And do time, around and get mine
# So I relax while you stress, try to follow the rest
# Never the less, I finesse, teach moves like it's my last speech
# My thoughts on the future, cause it don't equal the past
# Niggaz steady plotin', your every move we be watching
# There's no room for error, once you slip, your forgotten
# A never hasbeen, in a world of frame and fronters
# Who had to learn the hard way, how disease can take you under
# [Verse 2]
# Mall master be coming at you, that nigga that curse alot
# Shit, I even reverse a rock, I be feedin' ya purse with glocks
# Rushin' against your garment, daily Hailey Comet, a bomber
# Punk, you wanna fuck wit funk, have you breathing out ya armpit
# My guns that weighs the joint, don't even hand a malla' nina
# Have niggaz tits and too-toos, and on point like ballerinas
# You can bring ya best to west, found dressed in some rugged shit
# You blind, ridin' on my dick, don't know who you fuckin' with
# (From Crooklyn to west side Phil, we keep it real)
# So if you squeal on the reasons, for these heavens squeezin', the steel
# Slow subliminal criminals strangle triggers that's identical
# Mangle bitches that's fly, die with my dick inside ya genitals
# (Sendin' you through shit you never thought of
# The don who bust the sawed off
# So recogize, I squeeze and then ya life lost)
# [Verse 3]
# My raw essence is forever present
# But my team be chasing dreams of cream and digits in the seven
# The heavens, see my body is soul and ever presence
# My verbal tecture will bless you with scientific lessons
# On another plane, it's hard to maintain
# Cuz my membrane, causes strain within my inner frame
# The pain, from my people that be involuntary
# You in this game for this love, dunn, or monetary
# Forever keepin' the spirit, so like Elijah
# My verbal fire, will resurrect you like the great Messiah
# Desire, is like the law of the siren song
# Arm Leg Leg Arm, my word is bond, so I move on
# And stay strong like Egyptian Kings
# Rockin' diamond rings and things that it bring
# I spread the science, to all the planets, I'm hard as granite
# You need the knowledge of God, dunn, to understand it

# [Vinnie Paz]
# Yeah, I built with Alexander the Great
# He told the Persians they should stay gone
# Then he told me about the Oracle of Amar
# He gave me no clue, where it is
# Men feared time, yet time feared the pyramids
# He gave me more jewels, he told me that
# Amenhotep was a moral tool, I can't overstand hieroglyph
# So I called Killah Priest, and he taught me how to follow it
# I walked through the Valley of the Kings
# With a white robe, white rose and what I will brings
# And your whole team Judas, my road thin, gold skin like Juicis
# I speak the dialog of the dead, I practiced the same more tactics
# In King Arthur's head, so let the swordsmen kill the beast
# It's a Legacy of Blood, with Vinnie Paz and Killah Priest

# "The Sun Won't Come Out, unless the crowd start this
# Cause if it was my choice, you all dance in darkness" - CL Smooth "Sun Won't Come Out"

# Get the pen from the nurse, and hold the mic up first"
# "The rhymes, the rhymes, rhymes on the voter
# Burn him as a sacrifice"
# [Killah Priest]
# I paint flows with the feathers from the wings of angels
# Red ink from saint blood, nigga, you ain't thug
# Stare into the face of a king's mug
# Crush grape, feel the wine jug, ill thoughts
# Build from the mind of rhyme, rose, off the tongue like fine rugs
# Let me walk you through this, for the clueless
# I'm Shakespeare'ing, with grey earrings
# Speak like Tiburians, write novels
# Spit it like Aristotle, face half Pharoah
# And half owl, I took the path of Cairo
# Came back with the Dead Sea Gospel
# Now known as the Dead Street Apostle
# We shoot 'em feds, use them hollows
# Bullets spread, til they meet Diablo
# Stars in enlightment, Priest meet with Jedi Mind Tricks
# Reach them climates, where you can't breath
# Stay high off that dead weed, in the mind is where I plant seeds
# To grow fruit, of king's so brute, of army troops
# Mighty men in celestial suits
# You need healing, my mic give you incredible boost
# Where I use satellite vision, stare at my alphabetical soup
# Plus I use the Big Dipper to take, more than one scoop, it's Priesthood
# [Chorus: Stouple cuts up samples]
# "Straight up, we serve justice
# So if they can't be trusted, may you return where the dust is" -

# I studied element 1-15, with the Eloheim
# Saw the Canaanites, Sumerians, and the Philistines
# This is street gospel, if you don't believe

# You don't wanna see me and Killah Priest hostile
# You don't wanna see, desert eag' heat pop you
# This is Mothman Prophecy, walk back
# To the sand of Iraq, and let the prophet breath
# Returned all our water in the Tracik seas
# And walk in the wall with armor that I copped in the breeze
# Then I shoot the thieves, with a long arrow
# Studied Imhotep, to be a strong Pharoah
# It's a war when the God's spit
# It's Allah, when I split the ice birds, in the often
# I don't care what the cause is
# And I'mma ride for my fam, no matter what the cost is

# [Verse 1]
# My mathematical powers devour cowards as I spra words
# Like acid rain showers, nations, you can't face them
# Erase them or I praise them, as my mind excites the wind
# Like spirits of ill concensions, time will clash
# On ya cipher, lyric concealed behind whirlwind fire
# Or flood, draw blood from wack souls as I smack hoes
# Live concensive, or yes 'em, it's damage
# That my sintex causes, is irrepreble
# Cuz vanity of my insanity force ya whole click to be divided
# You have just bear witnessed to dub side united
# [Verse 2]
# Who do you love? Bugs, styles and fresh
# And numb somes of soul, witchcraft
# The clutch is the archer's mode, and sure plot
# Of device, we shot twice, after the same arrow
# Rush through life, it's off this slug
# Advise me with words from death, and new com battles
# Far time left, and pure shot plug that way
# You marathron, let me down to grace the plate
# Full stagnant, touch I, but revamp the squad
# Gettin' loops, saviate on contact
# [Verse 3]
# The triflyn four fists, sparks another spliff
# Bodies left stiff, you can't fuck with my ruggedness
# My gunshots is leaving niggaz on they asses
# Smoking all the canibus, like the weed savage
# Rip dimensions and it matters, take an L
# You no challenge, I blow up, ya muthafuckin' brain cells
# And leave you legal, the slang tongue spigel
# Cocks back the fifth, teflon starts to seek it
# Criminals on a move, set a threat
# Sip the moet, and let off the twin techs to ya
# muthafuckin' chest

# [Verse 4]
# I speak double-double, cause double trouble never do I rumble
# On a rule, my microphone sever clones
# It's beyond binocalurs, sence the moody, six chromosomes
# I'm no more less, no need to flex the evil, trip with the clip
# I got the 6-1-0 flow, and 0 and 2 is my zip
# Yo, so call me out in Philly when you down to flip
# No frill skills, or freestylin' when y'all wildin'
# I broke cats all the way live, on Velly's Long Island
# I visualize cream, tech's scrap with infered beams
# Stash keys, and tease, lickin' back so y'all can
# My click of criminals, flippin' confortable
# My pockets full of benjamins, fool surrending
# When I'm blendin' in, dub side invincible
# Imperial, for lyrical tactics
# I react with signs to get ya ass kicked
# Indeed the face of evil, is the face told by me
# So I proceed to bleed my people, niggaz say I'm too cerebral
# Lies, dub side, flippin' perfection through your section
# Sanity's slippin', whose the next victim to catch a bless
# [Verse 5]
# Set a threat, I rip the mic and run race like an auto practice
# I inflect this verse leavin' heads in they casket
# Watch this nappy headed villain, brutal torture is illegal
# I back down clowns with a four pound, as I defeat you
# Insert the lyrical slugs, that straight's very
# A nickel plated verse I spit like a hollow tip steady
# Constantly, drop ya wack back with fire weapon
# This adolescent, keeps a clip full for street protection
# Ain't nothing complex about the way I cock my biscuit
# I set and threat it, bust that tech son, it's not explicit
# Exquisite, in divine rhymes I drop like jewels
# The mic I abuse when I choose to break fool

# [Verse 6]
# With this course, I force many emcees out the galaxy
# Challenge me, I rip apart flows with analogy
# Now with me, got that establish and wrap ya cabbage with styles
# You can't manage to damage or even fathom the mental capacity
# Cuz I harass these wack emcee's, in degrees
# I splatter universe, and mountain casaulties
# In the dark, my squad sells, blowin' ya conscience
# My assumptions, ethotical, unstoppable, anthological
# I pull the trigger with mystical, my poetic
# Rip fanatics up, and rich with the sinical
# [Verse 7]
# Coming back from the city of Atlantic, it's the hispanic
# Causing mad panic, with fat static for ya addict
# Automatic, I stick shift quick if you test me
# Left the ciphers, layin' lifers, seen in one spot and attended
# That you get ya crews bruised in black and blues
# Put ya name and age on the front page, of the newspaper
# I drape my hood up on my carriage, damage faggots
# Quit the habits, feedin' on emcee's on maggots
# Inspect ya gadgets, my style switches cause I flick it
# Return the mic, fixin' stitches, cause I ripped it
# [Verse 8]
# I can't stand like a maniac depressin'
# That's been submerged in subterrarian eutopia
# Why's the mansion that I'm representin'
# Is the feel competitin' in suburbs
# Which has regenerated the etaric
# That kicks the subterric poetry on this plain of obscurity
# One element, top lyricist
# Intellectin' with, d-u-b squad of imperialist
# With an innevator as the dictator
# So we can see you, liver clues with side and system views
# Heads emulate but can't duplicate, cause this side

# [Verse 1]
# Adjust of us, to attacks the crowd
# The simple fly, plus arrows, I rush the format
# If four blind shots to ya verbs and pronouns
# These herbs'll slow down, with terms to sicken a guitar
# Dip live and you just the point to ball
# For sharp lines, make keen, the blast to catch phrase
# Overdrawn by the crowd who strikes amaze
# Never float like me, and oddly never lose a few
# So bear wits, to appreciate verse such as that
# Anitiate words to come back, over tight
# Nah, I'm different from these war heads
# More treds on my adjective's
# Allow full side steps, to deflect your ships
# Then he make a true vowels, with volume, see I'll
# Prospect tunnel, for me and Asan Icon
# We rock broad neck, funnels to collect
# The drips and moss, giving y'all friends and serves
# No connecting to our actual juice of five foot
# And the least to serve, with over stridal shoots
# Indeed and they relax in conforts
# They need to form and parse words, to lose any casual sense
# Of well being, yo lay back, grows ya depths
# [Verse 2]
# As the beings, squads find it hard to establish
# A working rhythm, my esoteric mysticism makes me a mathematician
# Like Apollonius, phony as any who receive lobotomies
# Get caught in my harsh, canapoly of unhappy rhapsodies
# Fragments of stagments, we world with ultramagnets
# My reverberation, crush men to micro fragments
# I get's physical in the forest of absolute manitrition
# My complex disposition, forces crews into submission
# Beginnings on one six two, switches through to witch's brew
# On which is true, or which is you
# Isolation, plus, a reflux, I see buck
# Who get the equilibrium shattered, or crushed to this
# I throw fists, and take trips, to other dimensions
# My henchmen will bend them and get attention
# As I destroy decoys and make noise
# My b-boys will be employed, to deploy like the falling of Troy
# Fell into the soul, control, what is concealed
# If a void is not filled, my suicidial thoughts will come real

# I traded a '57 Chevy for my first guitar
# And Daddy said I was crazy 'cause that was a helluva car
# When I played 'Love Me Tender' on that Fender
# And the music came pourin' out of my hands and heart
# He knew it was worth it and so did I
# 'Cause sometimes, some things don't have a price
# So, I learned to play all my heroes' songs
# And I finally got around to writin' a few of my own
# The songs got better, I put a band together
# And we played our first gig at a little club in McComb
# When I walked on stage and opened my mouth
# I started to sing and you came pouring out
# Ooh, ooh Mississippi
# You know how hard it was for me to leave
# Ooh, ooh Mississippi
# I miss you I hope you miss me
# My Mississippi
# So, I packed my Delta dreams and came to Music City
# Brought a whole lot of me, a little Presley and some Twitty
# I came here to make it but if I don't I can take it
# Just as long as I have you with me
# I know I'm gonna be strong enough
# 'Cause I've got your mud in my blood
# Ooh, ooh Mississippi
# You know how hard it was for me to leave
# Ooh, ooh Mississippi
# I miss you I hope you miss me

# You know I have four first loves

# I was born in Alabama, but I never knew my Momma.
# She gave me away at three months old.
# Some folks in Mississippi took me in an' kept me,
# An' treated me just like I was their own.
# A Holiness preacher man's daughter,
# And a hard-working sharecropper father.
# An' my Momma was Apache, my real Daddy? Hell, don't ask me.
# Momma says she don't remember him.
# An' I'm sure somewhere in my history, I've got some slave blood in me.
# An' some folks think I look Mexican.
# I never really fit in any place,
# 'Cause there's always a part of me to hate.
# I'm the rainbow man.
# That's who I am.
# I'm a little white an' black an' red and tanned.
# I've got all these different colors in my skin.
# I'm the rainbow man.
# Well, I know you may doubt it, but if you stop an' think about it,
# There's one common thing that we've all got.
# People from all countries come here because they're hungry,
# For what's cookin' in America's meltin' pot.
# We're all different but the same.
# Red's the only color in our veins.
# And I'm the rainbow man.
# Livin' in a rainbow land.
# I'm white an' black an' yellow an' brown an' red and tanned.
# And I'm so proud of all the colors that I am:
# I'm the rainbow man.
# All these colors make me American,
# I'm the rainbow man.

# First time I felt it, think I was five years old.
# I was scared, had a nightmare; Momma was there for me to hold.
# Daddy, he was different; he never said it much,
# But I heard him loud and clear when he brought home that ball and glove.
# Then it took on a brand new meaning,
# I wasn't just a boy no more, when she moved in next door.
# Where you from? What's your name?
# Wanna go to my game?
# Got the keys to my Dad's old truck.
# Turn the radio off to remember the song,
# We held hands and there we was,
# Love.
# Pages kept on turnin', there I was with someone else.
# First time in my lifetime, I wasn't livin' for myself.
# I knew I wasn't fallin', anywhere I'd fell before.
# This place was different: it was deeper, it was more.
# Then it took on a brand new meaning,
# Yeah, it was strong and it was true, knew what I had to do.
# Found a ring, hit my knees,
# Couldn't talk, couldn't breathe,
# My heart had me all choked up.
# Said: 'I do,' as we cried; wedding bells,
# Waved goodbye, the whole church knew it was:
# Love.
# Then it took on a brand new meaning,
# When the doctor said: 'It's time to watch your miracle arrive.'
# Thank the Lord, cut the cord.
# Take her home, help her grow.
# And complete the circle of love.
# Love.
# That's the circle of love.
# To fade out.

# I'd been to Church on Sunday, and I'd been in jail.
# And I put my family through livin' hell.
# And I'd been a heavy cross to bear,
# On the wings of Mama's prayers.
# I spent her last dollar on somethin' bad for me.
# I finally hit rock bottom, couldn't get up on my knees.
# But the strength came to lift me up from there,
# On the wings of Mama's prayers.
# I see her by the bed with her Bible open wide,
# Lookin' up at Heaven with tears in her eyes.
# She knew when I was troubled, she knew when I was scared.
# And I found salvation on the wings of Mama's prayers.
# I was lost in the darkness searching for the end.
# But the light of Mama's love led me back again.
# An' if I've got a place in Heaven, I'll get there,
# On the wings of Mama's prayers.
# I see her by the bed with her Bible open wide,
# Lookin' up at Heaven with tears in her eyes.
# She knew when I was troubled, she knew when I was scared.
# And I found salvation on the wings of Mama's prayers.
# I'm still holding on to the wings of Mama's prayers.

# I see faces and traces of home back in New York City
# So you think I'm a tough kid? Is that what you heard?
# Well I like to see some action and it gets into my blood.
# They call me the trail blazer - Rael - electric razor
# I'm a pitcher in the chain gang, we don't believe in pain only as strong,
# 'cos we're only as strong, as the weakest link in the chain.
# Let me out of Pontiac when I was just seventeen,
# I had to get it out of me, if you know what I mean, what I mean.
# You say I must be crazy, 'cos I don't care who I hit, who I hit.
# But I know it's me thats hittin' out, and I'm, I'm not full of shit.
# I don't care who I hurt. I don't care who I do wrong.
# This is your mess I'm stuck in, I really don't belong.
# When I take out my bottle, filled up high with gasoline,
# You can tell by the night fires where Rael has been, has been.
# As I cuddled the porcupine
# He said I had none to blame, but me.
# Held my heart, deep in hair,
# Time to shave, shave it off, it off.
# No time for romantic escape,
# When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!
# No time for romantic escape,
# When your fluffy heart is ready for ape. No!
# Off we go.
# You're sitting in your comfort you don't believe I'm real,
# You cannot buy protection from the way that I feel.
# Your progressive hypocrites hand out their trash,
# But it was mine in the first place, so I'll burn it to ash.
# And I've tasted all the strongest meats,
# And laid them down in coloured sheets.
# Laid them down in coloured sheets.
# Who needs illusion of love and affection
# When you're out walking in the streets with your mainline connection?
# Connection.
# As I cuddled the porcupine
# He said I had none to blame, but me.
# Held my heart, deep in hair,
# Time to shave, shave it off, it off.
# No time for romantic escape,
# When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!

# Please, don't get too close to me
# You said you are for real, it's not pretend
# All memories stolen, know this for yourself
# How would you like to be the happiest man in the world?
# Behind the weathered field hands
# Whose blistered paws Harvest cut
# For wedding clothes they'll never wear
# Marching down a road that was never there
# It takes place on a sunlit lace and the backbone broken
# Please bring us light

# If we wanted to be
# You are soft and young to me
# I am the ghost who comes and goes
# I'm hoping that I'll catch you in the throws
# Of one last look at joy that we've become
# But there's no easy answer, none to blame or forgive
# We were two cripples dancing
# To the bitter end we live
# I'm not with you, but of you
# I'm not with you but of you
# O, God, I loved you
# And all the past we once knew
# Some other love becomes you
# Whatever else it comes to
# I know we could be so happy, baby
# If we wanted to be
# We had a birthplace in common
# We had separate beds and lives
# I'll just sit here and glow
# Break out the oldest pictures
# Hand your ruined letters out to dry
# We had a birthplace in common
# And separate beds and lives
# And lives, and lives
# I know that we could be so happy, baby
# If we wanted to be
# I know that we could be so happy, baby
# Yeah oh.

# They say everything can be replaced,
# Yet every distance is not near.
# So i remember every face
# Of every man who put me here.
# I see my light come shining
# From the west unto the east.
# Any day now, any day now,
# I shall be released.
# They say every man needs protection,
# They say every man must fall.
# Yet i swear i see my reflection
# Some place so high above this wall.
# I see my light come shining
# From the west unto the east.
# Any day now, any day now,
# I shall be released.
# Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,
# Is a man who swears he's not to blame.
# All day long I hear him shout so loud,
# Crying out that he was framed.
# I see my light come shining
# From the west unto the east.
# Any day now, any day now,

# Ghost calls to visit
# With my keys in his pocket
# Kisses in my mouth with his
# Eyes hanging out of his sockets
# My memories crumble
# Under still resistance
# I was torn out like pages
# From the book of existence
# I woke up in a strange place
# My mind a blur and some blood on my chin
# I made a call for a blackened cab
# Some destination was moving on in
# I remember the words that you told me
# How they come down so hard, so plain
# Fate is going to find your love in a
# Glass of champagne
# I lied to my host i told him
# I knew how far i could go
# When i emptied my guts out
# On his brand new stereo
# Well he paid me to go upstairs
# And spend a night with his friend
# I never want to see my face
# In the mirror again
# I woke up in a strange place
# Music so loud that i spilled all my beer
# I met a ride in that blackened cab
# Some destination was all that he had
# Easy now, this car is speeding up
# For my last chance, crashing to freedom
# Fate is going to find your love in a
# Glass of champagne
# Sweat pours down
# You're in the back seat sleeping
# And she waits by the window
# On an empty bed, weeping
# The ghost guns the motor
# To the land that he promised me
# I guess this is the time when your
# Best intentions become facts again
# This is no song for the dislocated
# The one you loved but it turned to be hated
# Because the lies of the spirit possessed you
# Because the eyes of your lover resist you
# Listen now, you keep your aim steady
# As your temple turns to kiss the pistol
# Fate is going to find your love
# In a glass of champagne
# Fate is going to find your love
# In a glass of champagne

# If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
# She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear
# Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow
# She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so.
# We had a falling-out, like lovers often will
# And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
# And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
# She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
# If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
# I always have respected her for busting out and gettin' free
# Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
# Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make
# her stay.
# I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
# And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
# And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
# Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft.
# Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
# I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
# If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find
# Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.

# I used to know a little square
# So long ago, when I was small
# All summer long it had a fair
# Wonderful fair with swings and all
# I used to love my little fair
# And at the close of everyday
# I could be found, dancing around
# A merry-go-round that used to play...
# "Ah, mon amour
# A toi toujours
# Dans tes grands yeux
# Rien que nous deux"
# All summer long my little fair
# Made everyday like a holiday
# Night after night it used to play
# And people came there from so far away
# And everyone sang that little tune
# All around town you heard it played
# Even Pepi from Napoli
# He sang to Marie
# This serenade...

# I know you're a woman
# By the way you burn below
# I'll tell you secrets so good
# You'll never tell a soul
# Come closer, that bonfire holds his life like stones
# My years, my life unknown
# Diamonds from the pavement
# Where a broken glass had been
# Just like these troubles that I'm leaving to the wind
# Like sapphires in boxcars speeding towards the end
# Like thieves, my bad luck grows
# Jewel box of sadness
# Bring to catch your tear
# Crystalize illusion shine forgot I'm here
# Jewel box of sadness
# Bring to catch your tear
# Oh, you left some stars in my belly
# Star crossed child's love on the bands of wedding gold
# Silver studs of promise hide in the red crushed velvet folds
# Inaction, intention, like emeralds I stole
# My speech of custom gold
# I think I ought to know

# Looking out the door i see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
# Parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water
# And maybe i'm too young to keep good love from going wrong
# But tonight you're on my mind so you never know
# When i'm broken down and hungry for your love with no way to feed it
# Where are you tonight, child you know how much i need it
# Too young to hold on and too old to just break free and run
# Sometimes a man gets carried away, when he feels like he should be having his fun
# And much too blind to see the damage he's done
# Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one

# Will I ever see your sweet return
# Oh will I ever learn
# Oh lover, you should've come over
# 'Cause it's not too late
# Lonely is the room, the bed is made, the open window lets the rain in
# Burning in the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him
# My body turns and yearns for a sleep that will never come
# It's never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
# It's never over, all my riches for her smiles when i slept so soft against her
# It's never over, all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
# It's never over, she's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever

# To keep good love from going wrong

# I once was open
# And one with a travelling heart
# I loved this sweet guy
# Just like the fiction
# Rushing in your riverbed
# Arise like applause in my head
# And in the half-light
# Where we both stand
# This is the half-light
# See me as I am
# Just like the ocean
# Always in love with the moon
# It's overflowing now
# Inside you
# We fly right over
# The minds of so many in pain
# We are the smile of light that brings them rain
# In the half light
# Where we both stand
# In the half light
# You saw me as I am
# I am a railroad track abandoned
# With the sunset
# Forgetting
# I ever happened
# That I ever happened.

# How Many Times, Have u Heard Someone Say,
# If I Had Money, I Would Do Things My Way.
# But Little They Know, That It's So Hard To Find
# One Rich Man In Ten, With A Satisfied Mind.
# Money Can't Buy Back, All Your Youth When Your Old
# A Friend When Your Lonley, Or Peace To Your Soul
# The Wealtiest Person, Is A Pauper At Times
# Compared To The Man, With a Satisfied Mind.
# When My Life Is Over, And My Time Has Run Out,
# My Friends and My Lovers, I Will Leave, Theres No Doubt
# But One Things For Certain, When It Comes My Time
# I'll Leave This Old World With A Satisfied Mind
# But One Things For Certain, When It Comes My Time, Oh Yeah
# I'll Leave This Old World With A Satisfied Mind mind mind, mind mind,

# Love, let me sleep tonight on you couch
# And remember the smell of the fabric
# Of your simple city dress
# Oh... that was so real
# We walked around til the moon got full like a plate
# The wind blew an invocation and i fell asleep at the gate
# And I never stepped on the cracks 'cause i thought i'd hurt my mother
# And I couldn't awake from the nightmare that sucked me in and pulled me under
# Pulled me under
# Oh... that was so real
# I love you, but i'm afraid to love you

# Daisies after daisies, a daisy for your floor

# Southern trees bear strange fruit
# Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
# Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
# Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.
# Pastoral scene of the gallant south
# The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
# Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh
# Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.
# Here is fruit for the crows to pluck
# For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
# For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop
# Here is a strange and bitter crop.

# The night is bitter
# The stars have lost their glitter
# The winds grow colder
# And suddenly you're older
# And all because of the man that got away.
# No more his eager call
# The writing's on the wall
# The dreams you dreamed have all
# gone astray.
# The man that won you
# Has gone off and undone you.
# That great beginning
# Has seen the final inning.
# Don't know what happened. It's all a crazy game!
# No more that all time thrill
# For you've been through the mill
# And never a new love will
# be the same.
# Good riddance, goodbye!
# Every trick of his you're on to
# But fools will be fools
# And where's he gone to?
# The road gets rougher
# It's lonelier and tougher.
# With hope you burn up
# Tomorrow he may turn up
# There's just no let up the live-long night and day.
# Ever since this world began
# There is nothing sadder than
# A one-man woman looking for
# The man that got away...
# The man that got away.

# The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
# There are never toys that's scattered everywhere
# And when her baby comes to call
# He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen
# Cause when she's by his side

# Circle around the park
# Joining hands in silence
# Watch the evil black the sky
# The storm has ripped the shelter
# Of illusion from our brow
# This power is no mystery to us now.
# Leave your spirit genocide
# The cancer you won't remove
# We cast our funeral rose inside
# And bury the need to prove
# Our mutilation is to gain from the system
# Ooh, turn your head away
# From the screen, oh people
# It will tell you nothing more
# Don't suck the milk of flaccid Bill K.
# Public's empty promise
# To the people that the public can ignore
# This way of life is so devised
# To snuff out the mind that moves
# Moving with grace the men despise
# And women have learned to lose
# Throw off your shame or be
# a slave to the system
# I see you take another drag
# One more lost soul to raise your flag
# The sky is a landfill
# I see you take another drag
# Let's see you take another drag
# You like to dance to the rolling
# Head of the adulteress
# You sing in praise of suicide
# We know you're useless
# Like cops at the scene of the crime
# With your steroids and your feedbag
# And your stable and your trainer
# I got a mail bomb for you Mister Strong Arm.
# Throw out the stones from all the cemetery homes
# For the violence of a nation gone by
# Or the politics of weakness
# And the garbage dump of souls
# That will now black the sky
# Their yellow haze and crowds of eyes
# Will plug up the mind that moves
# Moving with grace the men despise
# And women have learned to lose
# We'll share our bodies
# In disdain for the system
# Oh, I see you take another drag
# One nation bends to kiss the hag
# The sky is a landfill

# I have no desire to make contact with all the thought of "no, no".
# I shiver now, to think of how this answer asked her, no.
# Long time gone. I run to my hide out.
# There ain't a star born that brightens
# More than you, you always should have known,
# I'll illuminate your question,
# Long time ago I'd died and gone.
# What has brought the question?
# Time has brought the question.

# Feel the power you cut the truth into you
# Why do you think I'd hidden out on this rely
# I could kiss you
# With lines of escape in my mouth
# Please let me bring back these gifts of mine to the woman
# His eyes shined on my back as I slept and knew you
# You didn't leave it all
# You made an even call
# My belly released the stars
# And tears between the scars. Ooooh
# We're where we belong
# It should end here
# Until the end of time
# Beyond the moment
# That ends our bondage
# I am your failed husband contender
# I'm your loan shark of bliss.
# This dream you've ridden on
# Turns your world to explosions
# You need to be alone
# To heal this bleeding stone
# Now, smell the rain of London it still insists
# That we beg for our purity
# As if we are pure in the rain of our contentment
# As if I can think of this no more.

# A crown of thorns
# A mockery
# Of You my God
# Of You my King
# You took my place
# A place so bleak and cold
# A crown of thorns
# A symbol of
# A desperate deed
# Your desperate love
# Your kindness, Lord
# Resounds inside of me
# CHORUS
# There will never be
# A crown so cruel
# You wore it like a king
# A king of fools
# You will always be
# The only King of kings
# A crown of thorns
# A crown of hate
# For all You had
# For all You gave
# The King of all
# Would rather serve than reign

# There was darkness in my soul
# Till I turned my heart toward you
# Now I worship at your feet
# As I boldly come to your throne
# To bless your holy name
# I was empty in my heart
# Till you filled me with your power
# Now I praise you more and more
# Until on that Day, with no more wait
# You have become my ray of light
# When I knew my sun was fading
# You are the source of all my soul
# You are the pure fire penetrating
# You have become my ray of light
# There was blindness in my eyes
# Till you touched me with your hand
# Now a passion burns within
# To be swept away in your embrace
# Forever and a day
# I lift up my heart to you
# I lift up my hands to you
# I give all my praise to you
# I lift up my life to you
# I lift up this song to you
# I give all my praise to you

# Don't let my heart be hardened
# Don't let my words be insincere
# Fill me to overflowing
# As I worship
# As I glorify your name
# Won't you make me
# A sacrifice of praise
# As I bow down
# As magnify your name
# Won't you make me
# A sacrifice of praise

# My heart has grown so cold

# I've said You were everything

# I wanna be free, Jesus
# I wanna be satisfied
# In You and You alone
# Take this heart, take my life
# Pull me close, satisfy
# My heart has heard Your call
# But I have closed my ears
# I've said I would follow You

# While holding to this world
# But now I'm letting go

# JOURNALIST: No one would have believed, in the last
# years of the
# nineteenth century, that human affairs were being
# watched from the timeless worlds
# of space.
# No one could have dreamed we were being scrutinized, as
# someone with a microscope
# studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of
# water. Few men even considered
# the possibility of life on other planets and yet, across
# the gulf of space, minds
# immeasurably superior to ours regarded this Earth with
# envious eyes, and slowly and
# surely, they drew their plans against us.
# At midnight on the twelfth of August, a huge mass of
# luminous gas erupted from Mars
# and sped towards Earth. Across two hundred million miles
# of void, invisibly hurtling
# towards us, came the first of the missiles that were to
# bring so much calamity to Earth.
# As I watched, there was another jet of gas. It was
# another missile, starting on its way.
# And that's how it was for the next ten nights. A flare,
# spurting out from Mars - bright
# green, drawing a green mist behind it - a beautiful, but
# somehow disturbing sight. Ogilvy,
# the astronomer, assured me we were in no danger. He was
# convinced there could be no
# living thing on that remote, forbidding planet.
# 'The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million
# to one,' he said.
# 'The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million
# to one - but still they
# come!'
# JOURNALIST: Then came the night the first missile
# approached Earth. It was thought
# to be an ordinary falling star, but next day there was a
# huge crater in the middle of the
# Common, and Ogilvy came to examine what lay there: a
# cylinder, thirty yards across,
# glowing hot... and with faint sounds of movement coming
# from within.
# Suddenly the top began moving, rotating, unscrewing, and
# Ogilvy feared there was a
# man inside, trying to escape. he rushed to the cylinder,
# but the intense heat stopped him
# before he could burn himself on the metal.
# 'The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million
# to one,' he said.
# 'The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million
# to one - but they still
# come!'
# 'Yes, the chances of anything coming from Mars are a
# million to one,' he said.
# 'The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million
# to one - but they still come!'
# It seems totally incredible to me now that everyone
# spent that evening as
# though it were just like any other. From the railway
# station came the sound of
# shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost
# into melody by the distance. It all
# seemed so safe and tranquil.

# A u ruci ti suvi martini
# I moje srce na sto palo je

# Ayer nos dos soñabamos con un mundo perfecto
# Ayer a nuestros labios les sobraban las palabras
# Porque en los ojos nos espiabamos el alma
# y la verdad no vacilaba en tu mirada
# Ayer nos no metimos conquistar el mundo entero
# Ayer tu me juraste que ese amor seria eterno
# Por que una vez equivocarse suficiente
# Para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente
# ¿Que Hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
# Hoy empañaste con tu furia mi mirada
# Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
# Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
# Con un permiso para si romperme el alma
# ¿Que Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
# Y nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras
# Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus farzas
# Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
# Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa
# Mañana que amanezca un dia nuevo en mi universo
# Mañana no vere tu nombre escrito entre mis versos
# No escuchare palabras de arrepentimiento
# Ignorare sin pena tu remordimiento
# Mañana olvidare que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante
# Mañana ni siquiera habra razones para odiarte
# Yo borrare todos tus sueños en mis sueños
# Que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos
# ¿Que Hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
# Hoy empañaste con tu furia mi mirada
# Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
# Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba

# It's four in the morning, the end of December
# I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
# New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
# There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening.
# I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
# You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record.
# Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
# She said that you gave it to her
# That night that you planned to go clear
# Did you ever go clear?
# Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older
# Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
# You'd been to the station to meet every train
# And you came home without Lili Marlene
# And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
# And when she came back she was nobody's wife.
# Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth
# One more thin gypsy thief
# Well I see Jane's awake --
# She sends her regards.
# And what can I tell you my brother, my killer
# What can I possibly say?
# I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
# I'm glad you stood in my way.
# If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me
# Your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free.
# Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
# I thought it was there for good so I never tried.
# And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
# She said that you gave it to her
# That night that you planned to go clear --

# Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
# Oh,I wish this could be real
# Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
# And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
# Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
# In the story of your heart
# Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
# I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
# Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
# And I don't think that I could face it  all again
# I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
# A deeper love I found in you,and I no longer doubt
# You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
# And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid
# Chorus
# I locked away my heart
# But you just set it free
# Emotions I felt
# Held me back from what my life should be
# I pushed you far away
# And you stayed with me
# I guess this means
# That you and me were meant to be

$ Como Ama Una Mujer
# Y llegas sin decirme nada
# Vienes envuelto en el silencio
# Vienes detras de una mirada
# O en el temor de un beso
# Detras de las pequenas cosas que
# Me hacen sentir la emocion de creer
# Entras en mi tan sutilmente
# Invisible como el aire mismo
# Me asaltas y jamas me adviertes que
# es el amor el que abraza esta piel, esta piel
# Amarte asi es pleno y es total
# Amarte es todo
# Amarte asi es locura y libertad
# Amarte es todo
# Amarte hasta llenar mi vida
# de suenos y de fantasias
# Amarte asi me da seguridad
# Y quien puede contra tu boca
# Que me hace hasta pedir auxilio
# Y quien puede con tus detalles que
# me hacen vivir y sentirme mujer, mujer

$ Como Ama Una Mujer
# Apresurate amor mio
# Que me pesan las memorias
# Que el recuerdo y el silencio
# No confundan nuestras cosas
# Apresurate que el tiempo vuela
# que amenaza con la cruel rutina
# Y se quiere llevar los momentos
# mas felices de la vida
# Por los dos por lo que siempre hemos sentido
# Por todo lo que vivimos apresurate mi amor
# Por que vuelvan los minutos porque no quiero perderte
# Porque vivo de ilusiones, porque sueno con amarte hoy
# Que los dias se van y es dificil otra oportunidad
# para estar asi, para volver a amar
# Quedate junto a mi, quedate junto a mi
# Ven apresura, te ruego
# No lo pensemos mas, que los dos nacimos para sonar
# y no quiero estar sola un minuto mas
# Quedate junto a mi, quedate junto a mi
# Ven apresura, te ruego
# Es tan necesario que estes de mi lado
# La distancia puede lastimar mis fuerzas
# Puedo resistir con mucho empeno
# pero el miedo me doblega
# Ese miedo a verme nuevamente sola
# A pensar que tanto amor ha sido en vano
# Es por eso que te necesito
# en mis dias y en mi espacio
# Por los dos por lo que siempre hemos luchado
# Por todo lo que pasamos apresurate mi amor
# Por que vuelvan los minutos, porque no quiero perderte
# Porque vivo de ilusiones porque sueno con amarte hoy

# It's a new day, new day, and it's evident
# You must have been heaven-sent
# Sometimes we should be hesitant, but I'm not at all
# Just feelin more confident
# Just using my common sense
# Just trust in it, I'm lovin it
# I can't refuse an offer so benevolent
# Can't assume he's gon' use me
# And after he'll never call again
# Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
# This is your day, this is your day
# [Chorus]
# It's time to be brave
# Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
# I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed
# It just ain't the same
# I'm not afraid, i'm not afraid
# Cus I've become brave
# As the light of day straight into a cave
# To show me the way, that I might be saved
# Now I'm turning the page
# Thanks to the power of love I can love
# Because I am brave
# I am brave, I am brave
# I heard him say this thing moving too fast for him
# It's a feelin I was straddeling
# Foolishly adamant, but It's all in his eyes
# Really wish he would let me in
# Cus the same way I'm scared of him
# I'm scared of being hurt again
# It's time to let go, let go of your heart
# It's time for a brand new start
# Never know, we might never part
# Baby don't be afraid, don't be afraid
# This is your day, this is your day

# Something that you can ride to
# Something that you can step to
# You know
# Sometimes real love can be
# Not seen 'cause you're thinkin'
# What's right in front of you
# Can't be the one for you
# Then one day you realize that
# There are feelings that you can't hold back
# And you're so caught up
# Now that's all you think of
# Crazy how
# All that talk of us not able to last
# Just because of mistakes we made in the past
# But they fail to understand
# I got you
# And nobody can come to change a thing
# 'Cause you gotta know
# You got me
# And it feels so good to have your back now
# I'm so proud
# I got you
# And if somebody tries to take you from me
# They will see I've got you
# You got me
# I got you
# Things are often said to
# Doubt what I feel for you
# But words that people say
# Won't take my love away
# Although it hurts sometimes, it's alright
# But why they say some things that ain't right
# I never know but please understand that baby, it ain't nothing
# All that talk of us not able to last
# Just because of mistakes we made in the past
# But they fail to understand
# I got you
# And nobody can come to change a thing
# 'Cause you gotta know
# You got me
# And it feels so good to have your back now
# I'm so proud

# They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)
# You got me (you got me, baby)
# I got you (I got you, baby)
# You got me (you got me, baby)
# So that's all that people can do
# Nevermind all the love, all that you
# gotta do is simply love, trust, and just stay...
# Together we'll get through whatever if we
# Don't let speculations make situations up
# We'll be alright
# I got you
# And nobody can come to change a thing
# 'Cause you gotta know
# You got me
# And it feels so good to have your back now
# I'm so proud
# I got you
# And if somebody tries to take you from me

# I guess I wasn't interested
# In finding something real
# Though I was looking for it
# You should've been looking for me
# But you opened up my eyes
# And now I can see
# And everytime the subject would come up
# When they say "I love you"
# Then I only dumb up
# A lot of guys
# A girl or shut up
# But you're the only guy that told me your love was endless
# A lot of words with feeling can not sum up
# But first I had to figure out who I was
# To try and understand that there ain't no shortcuts
# Now the only thing that's missing is your love
# I need love
# For the first time in my life
# I need love
# Ain't no love up in the club
# I need love
# Want to cuddle up to somethin'
# That make me feel like I'm somethin'

# If you really want me baby
# And I gave you all my trust
# Would you comfort me
# And if somehow you knew
# That your love would be untrue
# Would you lie to me
# And call me baby
# You said you want my love
# And you've got to have it all
# But first there are some things you need to know
# If you wanna live with all I have to give
# I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah
# I don't want you tryin' to get with me
# And I end up unhappy
# (I don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain)
# So before I do, give myself to you
# I have to know the truth
# If I spend my life with you
# C'mon and just dance a little
# Let me see you dance a little
# I like it when you dance a little
# Baby work it out just dance a little
# C'mon and just dance a little
# Let me see you dance a little

# No se que decirte, esta es la verdad
# Si la gente quiere, sabe lastimar
# Tu y yo partiremos, ellos no se mueven
# Pero en este cielo solo no me dejas
# No me dejes, no me dejes
# No me escuches si te digo no me ames
# No me dejes, no desarmes
# Mi corazon con ese no me ames
# No me ames te lo ruego
# Mi amargura dejame
# Sabes bien, que no puedo
# Que es inutil, que siempre te amare
# No me ames, pues te hare sufrir
# Con este corazon que se lleno de mil inviernos
# No me ames
# para asi olvidarte de tus dias grises
# Quiero que me ames solo
# No me ames, tu y yo volaremos
# Uno con el otro y seguiremos siempre juntos
# Este amor es como el sol que sale tras de la tormenta
# Como dos cometas en la misma estela
# No me ames No me ames

# Ayer t? me juraste que este amor seria eterno
# Por que una vez equivocarse es suficiente
# Para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente
# [Chorus:]
# Qu? Hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
# Hoy empanaste con tu furia mi mirada
# Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
# Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba

# Y nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras
# Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
# Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
# Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa
# Manana que amanezca un d?a nuevo en mi universo
# Manana no ver? tu nombre escrito entre mis versos
# No escuchare palabras de arrepentimiento
# Ignorare sin pena tu remordimiento
# Manana olvidare que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante
# Manana ni siquiera habr? razones para odiarte

# Ya las dudas y los miedos se me fueron
# Ya no tengo mas secretos que esconder
# Y a partir de este momento yo decreto
# que no hay nadie que me pueda detener
# No voy a pensar en que vendra manana
# Quiero despertar contigo cada amanecer
# [Repetir Coro]
# Las penas pasadas ahora son historia
# El umbral de las traiciones ya cruze
# Siento que tu amor me llevara a la gloria
# Estoy lista pa' quererte ya lo se
# [Repetir Coro]
# Te voy a querer aunque se oponga el viento
# Y nadie este de acuerdo, te juro que esta ves, ay yo
# Te voy a querer sin pedir opinion, sin dar explicaciones
# Soy libre pa' escoger, ay yo Te voy a querer

# It always feels like a love to me...in the beginning
# My mind is just a mirror of the way my heart wants it to be...
# I hope to see everything in his eyes, cause that's where it starts with the truth and the lies
# And I can-not hide my emotion; you cannot hide your intentions from me.
# [Chorus:]
# Don't you think, what I'm saying is, it's just the way it is, it's just the way it is
# Not everything is what you say it is, that's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
# And everything you do to me, it'll be done to you
# And everything I put you through, well then-I'll-go-through
# But I'm willing to take that chance, for this type of romance...its special baby
# I always look for love to be, so exciting...
# But you can't force it I'm finding, in reality chemistry is everything.
# [Chorus: x2]
# Don't you think, what I'm saying is, it's just the way it is, it's just the way it is
# Not everything is what you say it is, that's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is...
# Yeah yeah
# What your perception is, of our connection is simply perfection and it's the same thing
# If you're accepting it, then I'm accepting it, simple perfection and its just the same thing,
# uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uuuh-uh uh uh uh uh uh uuuh-uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uuuh-uh uh uh uh uh uh uuuhh
# [Chorus: x3]

# es el lenguaje de nuestros cuerpos
# Y a veces pienso que apareciste
# para mostrarme que el amor existe
# Tuuuuuuuuu, todo tuuuu
# Siempre tuuuuuu
# Todo tuuuuuuuuu
# Parar el tiempo me gustaria
# para fumarme a tu dulce filosofia
# Sentirme amiga del universo
# y en tu mirada ver el mismo cielo
# Por cada estrella, por cada noche
# se encuentran nuestras almas y se reconocen
# Porque lo quieres, porque lo pides
# voy a mostrarte que el amor existe
# Tuuuuuuuuu, todo tuuuuuuuu

# You ever try your luck with a pickup line
# But you just sucked
# You tell yourself it wasn't you
# And I know it's hard to hold it inside

# I fall asleep at night and often see you here, in my dreams
# holdin' me
# But when I wake up and I realise that
# you're not here with me
# It hurts so much I gotta have you baby
# Just wanna be cool with you again
> Jennifer Love Hewitt
# If I knew that this would all
# Come down to a sad goodbye
# I would see it through
# 'Til the tears burned my eyes
# Cause the loving you give to me
# So true and profound
# Is a sweetest gift I have ever found
# If I had to fight fire
# You know I would find a way
# For a love that's sacred
# I would fight until my last day
# I couldn't find another man
# Who loves me like you do
# I couldn't hold another hand
# Who holds me quite like you do
# Such a love was heaven-blessed
# Couldn't find another man
# Only you can set my heart on fire
# Or fill my life with pain
# And no matter if I laugh or cry
# I love you just the same
# Cause the moment I hold you close
# I see in your eyes
# With a silent stare
# You turn and look right back
# If I lost every pleasure
# Of silver and gold
# I would still find my treasure
# With you there to hold
# I couldn't find another man
# Who loves me like you do
# I couldn't hold another hand
# Who holds me quite like you do
# Such a love was heaven-blessed
# Couldn't find another man
# If I lost every pleasure
# Of silver and gold
# I would still find my treasure
# With you there to hold

# Every night, in the dark, I lie awake in bed
# How am I supposed to dream, with all the static in my head
# I turn in all directions and I pray for some relief
# What can I do but feel the weight I'm underneath
# And grit my teeth
# How do I deal with you
# How do I deal with me
# When I don't even know myself

# This is not your ordinary

# That you're the only one that I adore
# Can't we make this last forever

# Each precious minute that you were mine
# How do you prepare, when you love someone this way,
# To let them go a little more each day?
# The stars we put in place
# The dreams we didn't waste
# The sorrows we embraced
# The world belonged to you and me
# The oceans that we crossed
# The innocence we've lost
# The hurting at the end
# I go there again,
# 'cause it was beautiful.
# It was beautiful.
# Some days missing you is overwhelming
# When it hits me you're not coming back
# And in my darkest hours, I have wondered
# Was it worth it for the time we had?
# My thoughts get kinda scattered, but one thing I know is true
# I bless the day that I found you
# The stars we put in place
# The dreams we didn't waste
# The sorrows we embraced
# The world belonged to you and me
# The oceans that we crossed
# The innocence we've lost
# The hurting at the end
# I go there again,
# 'cause it was beautiful.
# It was beautiful.
# [musical bridge]
# The rules we stepped aside
# The fear that we defied
# The thrill of the ride
# The fire in our hearts that burned
# The oceans that we crossed
# The innocence we've lost
# The hurting at the end
# I go there again,
# 'cause it was beautiful.
# So beautiful.
# It was beautiful.

# Girl meets boy
# Girl goes crazy
# Boy backs away
# She gets her heart broken
# No words are spoken
# Boy comes back and acts as
# it evrything is cool
# Soon she's got him back on a pedestal
# She only sees what she wants to see
# Love is blind
# Lobe is so misleading
# (Chorus)
# I see the light, oh what a light
# And I an sober
# All that you served to me
# No longer will I drink it in
# I took the time to think it over
# I see the you I nver knew
# Now it's finally sinking in
# I am sober
# Girl wakes up and smells the coffee
# One day realises she's on her own again
# All alone again
# Boy takes every opportunity
# To play on every insecurity
# Get her back on track
# She's in a adaze
# Back in the firw
# But will she cave in to her old desires
# (Chorus)
# I see the light, oh what a light
# She's in a daze
# Back in the fire
# But will she cave in to her old desires

# You need to find your way to the river
# To let the water cool your brain
# Then maybe you'll find the time to forgive her
# And maybe she'll find the heart to do the same
# It's been so long since things were good
# You almost can't remember
# But then again you can't forget the way she stood
# On your front porch last September
# Chorus
# You need to find your way to the river
# To let the water cool your brain
# Then maybe you'll find the time to forgive her
# And maybe she'll find the heart to do the same
# Can't imagine Spring without those eyes
# The way she sings those sad songs
# She can make you feel like a fool when she doesn't even try
# Sometimes she treats you so wrong
# Chorus
# You need to show her the way to the river
# So you can wash away the pain
# And tell her you found the heart to forgive her
# Tell her you pray she'll ask you to stay
# So you can wash the pain away

# Skillet on the stove is such a temptation,

# What the fuck was I thinking?
# Love tears me up like a demon.
# Opens the wounds and fills them with lead,
# and I?m having some trouble just breathing.
# If we werent such good friends I think that I?d hate you.
# If we weren?t such good friends I?d wish you were dead

# It took a moment to make this little boy breathe,
# it was a moment when this little girl took a book trying to learn how to read.
# He started to feel the first innocent love
# and many barriers she climbed on the way finding out what’s all about.
# Living her life near the sea,
# rising up the day still there was thousands of miles in between (not that they knew).
# Somehow the song met the soul in the night,
# it took a moment to make those four eyes making thoughts go wild.
# Then digging in the sand and listening the band,
# not alone but with friends, old friends they saw them spinning.
# And then taking him up on the hill
# now alone with the lights down beneath in a small small town,
# whole life on short in words until that day
# When the Nature took him out, it took her out and put away,
# right there out from the sand and water blue.
# Saw them screaming out loud but the voice you couldn’t hear,
# they were the only ones who felt it.
# Those were the days that made them see what they wanted to see,
# feel what they wanted to feel.
# And what was to be said when they saw the man walking away
# and saw the girl standing there... why that moment made them the...
# And the Nature took him out, it took her out and put away,
# right there out from the sand and water blue.
# Saw them screaming out loud, but the voice you couldn’t hear,
# they were the only ones who felt it.
# And there was a time when paper-dates were on the wall and calendars fell off.
# They were too old, they were too old.
# And so he went once just to spend some time on his own,
# he went up north for a day or two, walking the streets of foreign town, just walking.
# And than he said: »Excuse me, do you know where I can get something to eat?«
# and she said: »I’m sorry, but I am not from here.«
# And then she turned around to see who she’s talking to and...
# It was a moment that made them cry, a moment that made them laugh,
# a moment that brought them back together for good...

# New company, my shit looked great
# But uh, me being the player that I am I couldn't stop
# I just had to find me something else to take to the top
# Something fly that'll catch your eye

# (Verse 3)
# In every flight there's turbulance and I had some
# But I remained focused and kept dropping the bomb
# 'What should I do next?' that was going through my head
# Then Candy introduced me to a Jagged Edge
# Three homies from the Dec, one from right around the corner
# We went in, came out, now everybody on 'em
# Three albums later, everyboby on 'em
# Ain't a city you can go where the girls don't want 'em
# Once again I was thinking 'whats next for me?'
# Then I got a big call from my homie Steve
# He said Hey, let throw something your way
# It was none other than my brother they comparing to MJ
# Girls can't stop screaming, three mill now
# Everybody love him and his name is Bow Wow
# As the game gets bigger, and my dough gets longer

# mi je rekel: "Ej kolega, daj ne mi s tem smrdet.
# Če misliš pušit, idi vun na sekret,"
# sem ga pogledal čudno, malo zgledal je zadet.
# Ja res škoda, ga je mama pustila,
# ko je bil še mali, se je vrgel na mamila.
# Sem prijel kitaro, da vidim, če še špila
# in zabrenkam enkrat, pri drugem je zastalo,
# ko isti tip ponudi jointek mi za šalo.
# And then something comletely different in my head.
# Na na na na na naj, moj Maribor, ko te zapuščam,
# postanem čisto nor.
# Brez družbe tvoje neka nova so pravila,
# da pridem k tebi, samo to mi v glavi špila.
# Ja trava obstaja že dolga stoletja,
# parlamentarne razprave se vlečejo ko leta.
# Evropa sem in tja, samo bla bla bla.
# Skočim gor, skočim dol, da pristanem na pomol.
# In sem žvekal enkrat, huba buba gumi,
# si računal v glavi, kolko stane olagumi.
# Me prešine misel, če ne bom mel cekine,
# lahko fašem virus, ta zlepa mi ne gine.
# Pa prišeta mimo, črnolasa muca,
# če povem po pravi, meni v glavi zaštuca.
# Sem pozabo čisto fsa pravila,
# mini krilo, lepe noge, moja mala morska vila.
# Ja res škoda, sorry olagumi, prej ko sem izvedo,
# že bla sva v šumi.
# Sem pozabo bi povedo kdo bolj koga rajca,
# ko ona vsede se na moja.

# Listje, kot listje pada moj polet,
# če nosim spanec k svojim ustom.
# Odtrgaj jermen mi z ramen,
# naj se dotaknem svojih dni.
# In drugič spet bom zopet sam,
# spal pod zibelko spominov.
# Se nežno s tabo bi igral
# in tebe gledal.
# Čas, kot čas mi teče tja v en dan,
# ko skupaj hecno sva bedela.
# Na tvojem licu moj nasmeh
# in vse je tak, da se mi zdi.
# Iskrivo skačem po sledeh,
# ko iščem sluh in zven tišine,
# zdaj srečno padava po tleh
# in zrak te boža.
# PADIVA, KAR NA MAVRICO Z OBČUTKOM.
# PELJIVA, SE NA NJEJ DOKLER GRE.
# Misel, kot misel pada naš planet
# in ogenj z ledom se igra.
# Si vzorce pletem iz besed,
# pozna se neka harmonija.
# Še črka spodaj iz peres,
# prišla je spesnit:

# [Verse 1]
# 3 in the morning, you hop on the train
# 3 Brooklyn fiends is scheming on your chain
# Mad blunts and licks to the head, you red
# Better sober up quick or you might get dead
# There's no one around so ain't no reason to scream out
# Here's your chance to be a gangsta nigga, back that thing out
# The next move you make will decide your fate
# Will it be die on the train or live life behind the gate
# You framing minor , you contemplate prison rate
# Your heart skip a beat and you select upstate
# It's on, you get a lump in your throat, niggaz weapons are drawn
# You so shook, you shoot straight through your coat
# 2 down, 1 boogie but before you gone
# The train stops and one of New York City's Finest jumps on
# "Whatchu gonna do.." [sound of da police, shoots]
# [Verse 2]
# 2:30 in the morning on a friday night
# It's one of those types of nights that everything's goin right
# In a club, fishing for bitches, anything tryin to bite
# Then the one that you want gets caught in your sight
# Face - picture perfect, big titties and fat ass
# She's asked if she wanna drink and she kindly pass
# Her response let you know she's not the average stunt
# She asks "do you got a dutch", you say "yeah", she roll a blunt
# Weed and conversation good, you fill the evening with laughter
# Then Shorty like: "yo, whatchu doing after"
# She continues what she's doing is outta character
# But, she live's alone and she wants you to smash her
# You bug, you can't believe that she tryin to fuck
# You like: "let's bounce", then you think "Lady Luck"
# You exit the club, hop up in your truck
# But when you get to Brooklyn East New York, you get stuck up
# "Whatchu gonna do.." [sound of da stick up]
# [Verse 3]
# 1 a.m. - you in the studio, dropping verses about how you flip kilos
# Get paper commit murder and pimp on hoes
# Crazy ice around your neck with the thugged out flows
# But it sounds like game to the street wise pro's
# Cause you be blabbing the  that you don't even know
# Straight pillow talking, I hope you walk the walk
# And be doing all the shit that's blasting out of shortie's walkman
# The last verse is laid, your men is like  dope fiend
# All of a sudden the sound  wide open
# 3 niggaz come in, screaming "where the cash"
# And you know the shit is real cause they ain't rocking masks
# They rocking big ass canons dawg, you better think fast
# Do you run what's yours or go for yours and blaaast..
# "whatchu gonna do.." [sound of da stick up]

$ Right Where You Want Me
# She left me hangin' by a thread again
# I stood there waiting like a fool for her
# I never dreamed that I'd be in this place
# But here I am all alone
# It's not the first time that she's walked away
# Changed all our plans within the blink of an eye
# And looking back it's always been the same
# But I refused to see it all for what it was
# [Chorus:]
# Has anybody ever felt this way
# Has anybody been ripped apart
# Anybody give everything to the one they love
# Am I the only one left behind
# Am I the only one who hates goodbyes
# God I know this can't go on forever
# I wonder if she ever thinks of me
# And all the promises she swore to keep
# Some nights I lay in bed just burning up
# 'Cause I know that she's out with someone else
# [Chorus]
# I was the one who gave up everything for her
# When no one would listen I heard every word, oh
# It took me so long to see that maybe I am better off alone
# [Chorus X2]
# God I know this can't go on
# All I wanna do is just move on

# Once or twice was enough
# And it was all in vain
# Time starts to pass
# Before you know it you're frozen
# Ooooh...
# But something happened
# For the very first time with you
# My heart melted into the ground
# Found something true
# And everyone's looking 'round
# Thinking I'm going crazy
# But I don't care what they say
# I'm in love with you
# They try to pull me away
# But they don't know the truth
# My heart's crippled by the vein
# That I keep on closing
# You cut me open and I
# Keep bleeding
# Keep, keep bleeding love
# I keep bleeding
# I keep, keep bleeding love
# Keep bleeding
# Keep, keep bleeding love
# You cut me open
# Oooh, oooh...
# Trying hard not to hear
# But they talk so loud
# Their piercing sounds fill my ears
# Try to fill me with doubt
# Yet I know that their goal
# Is to keep me from falling
# Hey, yeah!
# But nothing's greater
# Than the rush that comes with your embrace
# And in this world of loneliness
# I see your face
# Yet everyone around me
# Thinks that I'm going crazy
# Maybe, maybe
# But I don't care what they say
# I'm in love with you
# They try to pull me away

# You cut me open
# And it's draining all of me
# Oh they find it hard to believe

# You think that you're the bomb
# And that your game is tight
# And usually I'd give you props
# But no no, not tonight

# verse 1:
# Your love is as strong,
# As the widest river is long
# And here stands the man the man too afraid
# To jump in so you thought it should end.
# Thoes pretty eyes,never lie
# You say it's over,but you eyes deny
# You so in control, that's what you think
# Why are you fooling yourself,baby
# Your not fooling me
# chours:
# is it over
# you and I
# are you truly better off without me there by you side
# is it over
# you and I(something in your eyes)
# something in your eyes is telling me not to say goodbye
# verse 2:
# Baby if it's over
# If its gone
# Stop this world I dont wanna stay on
# If time heals all wound
# Why is it no use
# It's no use at all to my broken heart
# Your involved
# Moving on
# And you just cant up and leave him alone
# It wouldn't be right
# To do him so wrong
# Please don't expect my simpathy
# Girl when you just did that to me
# Chourse
# I'd like just to be your friend
# And hope that someday,we'd love again
# Sorry but I can't pretend

# You take my breath away
# When you hold me close

# When we're makin' love
# You take my breath away

# This is the love that I've been missing
# I feel like I'm frozen in time
# Whenever your lips meet mine
# Everytime you touch me, I go out of my mind
# The passion I see in your eyes
# Has got me more than hypnotized
# Renders me defenseless girl
# I don't know what you do to me baby

# I lose control when we're kissin' and huggin', yeah

# There's no need for me to try to conceal
# My love for you girl
# My heart just can't keep still

# Leave the ghosts behind

# Just the thought of this night
# Will get me every time

# Well, the voice in my head said
# "What are you doing?"
# I thought not listening to you
# You see I'm taking a chance
# I'm thinking about flying over the blue
# And it's crazy to be this out of practice
# And have it all come so naturally
# Don't you love knocking logic right off its axis
# And watch it float far out to sea

# I can't kick your affecetion
# I'm sick of tryin' to
# You're like a bad addiction
# Runnin' through my veins
# You're the habit I crave, Yeah
# Some kinda voodoo in your eyes
# Has my head hypnotized
# Baby to love you once
# Baby to love you once
# Baby to love you once
# Is to love you forever
# I've come to one conclusion
# That there's just no substitution
# Baby to love you once
# Baby to love you once
# Baby to love you once
# Is to love you forever
# One look and I was hooked
# One touch was all it took
# Your lips, your velvet skin
# Pulled me over and under and in

# How could anyone be so hard
# Did you think I had an unbreakable heart
# I suppose I should know
# Sometimes love just comes and goes
# But I believed foolish me
# Wed go on and on

# So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry

# The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there
# Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there
# I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now

# This is the story of the hare who lost his spectacles.
# Owl loved to rest quietly whilst no one was watching.
# Sitting on a fence one day, he was surprised when suddenly a kangaroo ran close by.
# Now this may not seem strange, but when Owl overheard Kangaroo whisper to no one in particular,
# "The hare has lost his spectacles," well, he began to wonder.
# Presently, the moon appeared from behind a cloud and there, lying on the grass was hare.
# In the stream that flowed by the grass a newt.
# And sitting astride a twig of a bush a bee.
# Ostensibly motionless, the hare was trembling with excitement,
# for without his spectacles he appeared completely helpless.
# Where were his spectacles? Could
# someone have stolen them? Had he mislaid them? What was he to do?
# Bee wanted to help, and thinking he had the answer began:
# "You probably ate them thinking they were a carrot."
# "No!" interrupted Owl, who was wise.
# "I have good eye-sight, insight, and foresight.
# How could an intelligent hare make such a silly mistake?"
# But all this time, Owl had been sitting on the fence, scowling!
# A Kangaroo were hopping mad at this sort of talk.
# She thought herself far superior in intelligence to the others.
# She was their leader, their guru. She had the answer:
# "Hare, you must go in search of the optician."
# But then she realized that Hare was completely helpless without his spectacles.
# And so, Kangaroo loudly proclaimed, "I can't send Hare in search of anything!"
# "You can guru, you can!" shouted Newt.
# "You can send him with Owl."
# But Owl had gone to sleep.
# Newt knew too much to be stopped by so small a problem
# "You can take him in your pouch."
# But alas, Hare was much too big to fit into Kangaroo's pouch.
# All this time, it had been quite plain to hare that the others knew nothing about spectacles.
# As for all their tempting ideas, well Hare didn't care.
# The lost spectacles were his own affair.
# And after all, Hare did have a spare a-pair.

# Give sixty days for just one night.
# Don't think I'd make it: but then I might.

$ Living In Tha Past
# There's the stillness of death on a deathly unliving sea,
# and the motor car magical world long since ceased to be,
# when the Eve-bitten apple returned to destroy the tree.
# Incestuous ancestry's charabanc ride,
# spawning new millions throws the world on its side.
# Supporting their far-flung illusion, the national curse,
# and those with no sandwiches please get off the bus.
# The excrement bubbles,
# the century's slime decays
# and the brainwashing government lackeys
# would have us say
# it's under control and we'll soon be on our way
# to a grand year for babies and quiz panel games
# of the hot hungry millions you'll be sure to remain.
# The natural resources are dwindling and no one grows old,
# and those with no homes to go to, please dig yourself holes.
# We wandered through quiet lands, felt the first breath of snow.
# Searched for the last pigeon, slate grey I've been told.
# Stumbled on a daffodil which she crushed in the rush, heard it sigh,
# and left it to die.
# At once felt remorse and were touched by the loss of our own,
# held its poor broken head in her hands,
# dropped soft tears in the snow,
# and it's only the taking that makes you what you are.
# Wond'ring aloud will a son one day be born
# to share in our infancy
# in the child's path we've worn.
# In the aging seclusion of this earth that our birth did surprise
# we'll open his eyes.

# Wond'ring aloud
# how we feel today.
# Last night sipped the sunset
# my hands in her hair.
# We are our own saviours
# as we start both our hearts beating life
# into each other.
# Wond'ring aloud
# will the years treat us well.
# As she floats in the kitchen,
# I'm tasting the smell
# of toast as the butter runs.
# Then she comes, spilling crumbs on the bed
# and I shake my head.
# And it's only the giving
# that makes you what you are.

# When I was a young man (as all good tales begin)
# I was taught to hold out my hand
# And for my pay I worked an honest day
# and took what pittance I could win
# Now I'm a working John and I'm a working Joe
# and I'm doing what I know
# for God and the Economy
# Big brother watches over me
# And the state protects and feeds me
# And my conscience never leaves me
# And I'm loyal to the unions
# who protect me at all levels
# And as I grew, the winds of fortune blew
# and the bank smiled down upon me
# And mortgaged to the hilt I threw
# the breeze of caution behind me
# Now I'm a working John and I'm a working Joe
# and I'm good at what I know
# And God and the Economy
# have blessed me with equality
# Now I'm equal to the best of you
# And better than the rest of you
# who would criticise my success
# in times of national unrest
# Now I own my horseless carriage
# in its central-heated garage
# And I commute eighty miles a day
# up at seven to make it pay
# I direct ten limited companies
# with seeming consummate expertise
# two ulcers and a heart disease
# a trembling feeling in both knees
# I'm a working John and I'm a working Joe

# Adrian came home again last summer
# Things just haven't been the same around here
# And people talk and people stare
# Oh, Adrian, come out and play
# An unfortunate accident in a canoe
# Doctor said, "I'm sorry, not much I can do"
# And the air was so still and his eyes, they did not blink
# Oh, Adrian, come out and play
# Little Mary Epperson liked him
# And she vowed always to watch after him
# But still he did not move and the doctor said "it's no use"
# Oh, Adrian, come out and play
# She sat by his side and watched the years fly by
# He looked so fragile, he looked so small
# She wondered why he was still alive at all
# Everyone in town had that "I'm so sorry look"
# They talked in a whispered hush, said "I'd turn the machines off"
# But still she sat by his side, she said, "life he won't be denied"
# Oh Adrian, come out and play
# Yellow flowers decorate his bedroom
# Sign above his door says Welcome Home
# But he just sits and stares
# He's awake but still not there
# Oh, Adrian, come out and play
# She sat by his side and watched the years fly by
# He looked so fragile, he looked so small
# She wondered why he was still alive at all
# And little Mary Apperson grew up lovely
# And she still comes to visit him on Sundays
# He's like an unused toy
# He's got big hands but the mind of a little boy
# Oh, Adrian, come out and play
# Adrian came home again last summer
# Things just haven't been the same around here

# You're mothers' child, but night lays you down
# Hair aflame, wild look in your eyes
# Naked belly to the ground
# A forest fire nibbles at your veins
# Crawls up your arm, runs away with your mind
# And burns dry thoughts like leaves
# Amen
# Eyes stare up, but something's in the way
# In the Bible only angels have wings
# And the rest must wait to be saved
# A dry tongue screams at the sky
# But the wind just breathes words in
# As a strange bird tries to fly
# Amen
# Pieces of us die everyday as though our flesh were hell
# Such injustice, as children we are told that from God we fell
# Where are my angels?
# Where's my golden one?
# Where's my hope now that my heros have gone?
# Some are being beaten, some are being born
# And some can't tell the difference anymore
# Amen

# Break me

# Just let me feel your love again

# My bones are tired, Daddy
# I don't get enough sleep, I don't eat as good as I should, Daddy
# What's that say about me?
# Sometimes I sleep past noon, Daddy
# Drink lots of black coffee and I smoke like a chimney
# Yes, I left the refrigerator door half open, Daddy
# What's that say about me?
# Sometimes I want to rip out your throat, Daddy
# For all those things you said that were mean
# Gonna make you just as vulnerable as I was, Daddy
# What's that say about me?
# Sometimes I want to bash in your teeth, Daddy
# Gonna use your tongue as a stamp
# Gonna rip your heart out the way you did mine, Daddy
# Go ahead and psychoanalyze that
# 'Cause I'm your creation, I'm your love, Daddy
# Grew up to be and do all those sick things you said I'd do
# Well last night I saw you sneak out your window with your white hood, Daddy
# What's that say about you?
# I'm sloppy, what's that say about you?
# I'm messy, what's that say about you?
# My bones are tired, Daddy.

# You find yourself falling down
# Your hopes in the sky
# But your heart like grape gum on the ground
# And you try to find yourself
# In the abstractions of religion
# And the cruelty of everyone else
# And you wake up to realize
# Your standard of living somehow got stuck on survive
# When you're standing in deep water
# And you're bailing yourself out with a straw
# And when you're drowning in deep water
# And you wake up making love to a wall
# Well it's these little times that help to remind
# It's nothing without love
# You wake up to realize your only friend
# Has never been yourself or anyone who cared in the end
# That's when suddenly everything fades or falls away
# Cause the chains which once held us are only the chains which we've made
# Chorus
# We've compromised our pride
# And sacrificed our health
# We have to demand more
# Not of each other
# But more from ourselves

# Don't walk too close, don't breathe so soft
# Don't talk so sweet, don't sing
# Don't lay oh so near
# Please, don't let me fall in love with you again
# Please let me forget all those sweet smiles
# All of the passion, all of the peace, the heat, the pain
# All those blue skies where your words were my freedom
# Please, don't let me fall in love with you again
# Too many times I've cared too much
# I stood on the edge and saw that you held my hand
# And knowing too well I couldn't hide from those eyes
# Please, don't let me fall in love with you again
# Don't let me fall in love with you again

# Sun sets'cross the ocean,I'm a thousand miles from anywhere
# My pocketbook and my heart both just got stolen
# And the sun act like she don't even care
# The wind blows cold when you reach the top
# it feels like someone's face is stuck to the bottom of my shoe
# I got a plastic jesus
# a cordless telephone for every corner of my room
# Got everybody but you telling me what to do
# (CHORUS)
# But've been down so long, oh it can't be longer still
# I've (we've) been down so long
# (the end must be...I know the end must be...)
# that the end must be drawing near
# I look to everybody but me to answer my prayers
# 'till I saw an angel in the bathroom
# who said she saw no one, worth saving anywhere
# and a blind man o the corner said
# it's simple, like flipping a coin
# don't matter what a said it lands on of it's someone else's dime

# I take a trip,catch a train,
# I catch a plane, I got a ticket in my hand
# And then a man takes my money, and I like cattle we all stand

# You took your coat off and stood in the rain
# You were always crazy like that
# I watched from my window
# Always felt I was outside looking in on you
# You were always the mysterious one with dark eyes and careless hair
# You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care
# Then you stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
# Besides some comment on the weather
# Well in case you failed to notice, in case you failed to see
# This is my heart bleeding before you, this is me down on my knees
# These foolish games are tearing me apart
# Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
# You're breaking my heart
# You were always brilliant in morning
# Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee
# You philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
# You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
# As I clumsily strummed my guitar
# You'd teach me of honest things
# Things that were daring, things that were clean
# Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
# So I hid my soiled hands behind my back
# Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you
# Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else
# Somebody who gave a damn, somebody more like myself
# These foolish games are tearing me apart
# You're tearing me, tearing me, tearing me apart
# Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
# You're breaking my heart
# You took off your coat and stood in the rain
# You were always crazy like that

# If I could tell the world just one thing
# It would be that we're all OK
# And not to worry 'cause worry is wasteful
# And useless in times like these
# I won't be made useless
# I won't be idle with despair
# I will gather myself around my faith
# For light does the darkness most fear
# My hands are small, I know
# But they're not yours, they are my own
# But they're not yours, they are my own
# And I am never broken
# Poverty stole your golden shoes
# But it didn't steal your laughter
# And heartache came to visit me
# But I knew it wasn't ever after
# We'll fight, not out of spite
# For someone must stand up for what's right
# 'Cause where there's a man who has no voice
# There ours shall go singing
# My hands are small I know
# But they're not yours, they are my own
# But they're not yours, they are my own
# And I am never broken
# In the end only kindness matters
# In the end only kindness matters
# I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
# I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
# I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
# My hands are small I know
# But they're not yours, they are my own
# But they're not yours, they are my own
# And I am never broken
# My hands are small I know
# But they're not yours, they are my own
# But they're not yours, they are my own
# And I am never broken
# We are never broken
# We are God's eyes
# God's hands
# God's mind
# We are God's eyes

# I was thinking that I might fly today
# Just to disprove all the things that you say
# It doesn't take a talent to be mean
# You words can crush things that are unseen
# So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
# And I'd like to stay that way
# You always tell me that it's impossible
# To be respected, and be a girl
# Why's it gotta be so complicated
# Why you gotta tell me if I'm hated
# So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
# And I'd like to stay that way
# I was thinking, that it might do some good
# If we robbed the cynics and took all their food
# That way what they believe will have taken place
# And we can give it everybody who have some faith
# So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
# And I'd like to stay that way
# I have this theory, that if we told we're bad
# Then that's the only idea we'll ever have
# But maybe if we are surrounded in beauty
# Someday we will become what we see
# 'Cause anyone can start a conflict
# It's harder yet to disregard it
# I'd rather see the world from another angle
# We are everyday angels
# Be careful with me 'cause I'd like to stay that way

# You got something that you want me to sell
# Sell your sin. Just cash in.

# You'll love me. Wait and see.
# If you want me
# Don't play games
# I promise

# Venus de Milo in her half-baked shell
# Understood the nature of love very well
# She said, "A good love is delicious, you can't get enough too soon.
# It makes you so crazy you want to swallow the moon."
# Oh, oh Jupiter
# Oh, oh be still my little heart
# Oh, oh love is a flame neither timid nor tame
# Take these stars from my crown
# Let the years fall down
# Lay me out in firelight
# Let my skin feel the night
# Fasten me to your side
# Say it will be soon
# You make me so crazy, baby
# Could swallow the moon
# My hands are two travelers they've crossed oceans and lands
# Yet they are too small on the continent of your skin
# Wandering, wandering I could spend my life
# Traveling the length of your body each night

# Hey little sister, I heard you went to Mr. So and So
# Knock, knock, knocking on his door again last night
# Said you needed it bad, you know that ain't right
# Cause you've come to me crying, trying to stop
# You said it hurts so bad but please don't let you go back for more
# My little sister is a Zombie in a body with no soul
# A role she has learned to play in a world today where nothing else matters
# But it matters, we gotta start feeding our souls not our addictions or afflictions of pain
# To avoid the same questions we must ask ourselves to get any answers
# We gotta start feeding, our souls have been lost to the millions with lots
# Who feed on addiction selling pills and what's hot
# And I wish I could save her from all their delusions, all the confusion
# Of a nation that starves for salvation but clothing is the closest approximation
# To God and He only knows that drugs are all we know of love
# Every day we starve while we eat white bread and beer instead of a handshake or hug
# We spill the pills and sweep them under the rug
# My little sister is a Zombie in a body with no soul
# A role she has learned to play in a world today where nothing else matters
# But it matters, we gotta start feeding our souls
# Hey little sister I heard you went to Mr. So and So
# Knock, knock, knockin' on his door again last night

# And stop thinking about what your sister said
# Stop worrying about it, the cat's already been fed
# Come on darlin', let's go back to bed
# Put the phone machine on hold
# Leave the dishes in the sink
# Do not answer the door
# It's you that I adore, I'm gonna give you some more
# We'll sit on the front porch, the sun can warm my feet
# You can drink your coffee with sugar and cream, I'll drink my decaf herbal tea
# Pretend we're perfect strangers and that we never met
# My how you remind me of a man I used to sleep with, that's a face I'd never forget
# You can be Henry Miller and I'll be Anais Nin
# Except this time it'll be even better, we'll stay together in the end
# Come on darlin', let's go back to bed

# Please don't say I love you, those words touch me much too deeply
# And they make my core tremble
# Don't think you realize the effect you have over me
# And please don't look at me like that, it just makes me want to make you near me always
# And please don't kiss me so sweet, it makes me crave a thousand kisses to follow
# And please don't touch me like that, it makes every other embrace seem pale and shallow
# And please don't come so close, it just makes me want to make you near me always
# Please don't send me flowers, they only whisper the sweet things you'd say
# Don't try to understand me, your hands already know too much anyway
# It just makes me want to make you near me always
# And when you look in my eyes, please know my heart is in your hands
# It's nothing that I understand, but when in your arms you have complete power over me
# So be gentle if you please 'cause your hands are in my hair, but my heart is in your teeth, baby
# And it makes me want to make you near me always
# Your hands are in my hair, but my heart is in your teeth, baby
# And it makes me want to make you near me always
# I want to be near you always
# I want to be near you always
# I want to be near you always

# Eighty years, an old lady now, sitting on the front porch
# Watching the clouds roll by they remind her of her lover, how he left her
# And of times long ago when she used color carelessly, painted his portrait
# A thousand times - or maybe just his smile -
# And she and her canvas would follow him wherever he would go
# 'Cause they were painters, and they had painting themselves, a lovely world
# Oil streaked daisies covered the living room wall
# He put water colored roses in her hair
# He said, "Love, I love you, I want to give you the mountains, the sunshine, the sunset too"
# I just want to give you a world as beautiful as you are to me
# 'Cause they were painters, and they had painting themselves, a lovely world
# So they sat down and made a drawing of their love, they made it an art to live by
# They painted every, passion every home, created every beautiful child
# In the winter they were weavers of warmth, in the summer they were carpenters of love
# They thought blue prints were too sad so they made them yellow
# 'Cause they were painters, and they had painting themselves, a lovely world
# Until one day the rain fell as thick as black oil
# And in her heart she knew something was wrong
# She went running through the orchard screaming
# 'No God, don't take him from me!'
# But by the time she got there, she feared he already had gone
# She got to where he lay, water colored roses in his hands for her
# She threw them down screaming, 'Damn you man, don't leave me
# With nothing left behind but these cold paintings, these cold portraits
# to remind me!'
# He said, 'Love I only leave, but only a little, try to understand
# I put my soul in this life we've created with these four hands
# Love, I leave, but only a little, this world holds me still
# My body may die now, but these paintings are real'
# So many seasons came and so many seasons went
# And many times she saw her love's face watering the flowers
# Talking to the trees and singing to his children
# And when the wind blew, she knew he was listening
# And how he seemed to laugh along, an how he seemed to hold her when she was crying
# 'Cause they were painters, and they had painting themselves, a lovely world
# Eighty years, an old lady now, sitting on the front porch
# Watching the clouds roll by, they remind her of her lover, how he left her
# And of times long ago when she used color carelessly, painted his portrait
# A thousand times - or maybe just his smile -
# And she and her canvas would follow him wherever he would go
# Yes, she and her canvas still follow
# 'Cause they were painters, and they had painting themselves, a lovely world

# People living their lives for you on TV

# He says hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls
# Says come here boys, there ain't nothing for free
# Another doctor's bill, another lawyer's bill, another cute cheap thrill
# You know you love him if you put him in your will, but ...
# Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers now
# Who will save your soul after all the lies that you told, boy
# Who will save your soul if you won't save your own?
# We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss them
# The cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue
# Another day, another dollar, another war, another tower
# Went up to where the homeless had their homes
# So we pray to as many different gods are there are flowers
# But we call religion our friend
# We're so worried about saving our souls
# Afraid that God will take His toll that we forget to begin but
# Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers now
# Who will save your soul after all the lies that you told, boy
# Who will save your soul if you won't save your own?
# Some are walking, some are talking, some are stalking their kill
# You got social security, but that don't pay your bills
# There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay
# So you bargain with the Devil, say you're o.k. for today
# You say that you love them, take their money and run
# Say, it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things
# Those flings, those strings you've got to cut
# So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts
# Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers now
# Who will save your soul after all the lies that you told, boy
# Who will save your soul if you won't save your own?

# Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
# So picked up a paper, it was more bad news

# Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
# Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
# Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
# Met him on a Thursday, sunny afternoon
# Cumulus clouds, 84 degrees
# He was brown, deep
# Said he wanted to talk about my mission
# Listen to my past lives. (Word?)
# Took me on long walks to places where butterflies rest easy
# Talked about Moses and Mumia
# Reparations, blue colors, memories of shell-topped Adidas
# He was fresh, like summer peaches
# Sweet on my mind like block parties and penny candy
# Us was nice and warm, no jacket, no umbrella, just warm
# At night we would watch the stars
# And he would physically give me each and every one
# I felt like cayenne pepper, red, hot, spicy
# I felt dizzy and so near heaven and miles between my thighs
# Better than love, we made delicious
# He me had, had me he
# He had me tongue tied
# I could hear his rhythm in my thoughts
# I was his sharp, his horn section
# His boom and his bip
# And he was my love
# Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
# The rain was fallin' and, and slowly and sweetly and stinging my eyes
# And I could not see that he became my voodoo priest
# And I was his faithful concubine
# Wide open, wide, loose like bowels after collard greens
# The mistake was made
# Love slipped from my lips
# Dripped down my chin and landed in his lap
# And us became new
# Now me non-clarivoyant and in love
# Made the coochie easy and the obvious invisible
# The rain was falling
# And I couldn't see the season changing
# And the vibe slipping off it's axis
# Our beautiful melody became wildly staccato
# (Repeat 1 in background)
# The rain was falling and I could not see
# That I was to be plowed and sowed and fertilized
# And left to drown in his sunny afternoon
# Cumulus clouds, 84 degrees, melody
# Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
# Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

# I stretched my arms towards the sky like blades of tall grass
# The sun beat between my shoulders like carnival drums
# I sat still in hopes that it would help my wings grow
# So then I could really be fly
# And then she arrived
# Like day break inside a railway tunnel
# Like the new moon, like a diamond in the mines
# Like high noon to a drunkard, sudden
# She made my heart beat in a now-now time signature
# Her skinny canvas for ultraviolet brushstrokes
# She was the sun's painting
# She was a deep cognac color
# Her eyes sparkled like lights along the new city
# She lips pursed as if her breath was too sweet
# And full for her mouth to hold
# I said, "You are the beautiful, distress of mathematics."
# I said, "For you, I would peel open the clouds like new fruit
# And give you lightning and thunder as a dowry
# I would make the sky shed all of it's stars like rain
# And I would clasp the constellations across your waist
# And I would make the heavens your cape
# And they would be pleased to cover you
# They would be pleased to cover you
# May I please, cover you, please"

# His name was Rasool
# Carmel completed boy from the 22
# Rough on the outside
# But on the inside he was cool
# Rasool was a king
# But also a fool
# Back on the block again with the same crew
# Tariq from the west side
# Little John form the avenue
# Always seen um bout a quarter to two
# Shaking hands with everybody
# But at the same time sharing the blues
# And oh how he passed it on
# Shaking hands till what was in his pockets was gone
# He'd be outside in the cold with his bubble goose on
# But inside
# I knew he wasn't warm
# Around 10:30 on that dreary night
# His bowaz said they were hungry they were hungry
# Wanted to get a bite
# But they didn't send a runner
# Rasool knew it wasn't right
# But he stayed anyway to get the chain he liked
# And oh how the shots rang in the streets
# Hitting everybody in the surrounding vicinity
# Children of the children
# One young father to be
# And Rasool lay dead in my north Philly Street
# At fifteen years old
# It was the first death I'd seen
# But the game ain't designed for no kind of winning
# And oh this is a friend of Rasool
# Telling you to think about what you do and who you call your crew
# The very choices you make
# May make a Rasool out of you
# Now you don't want that do you?

# Feeling the way I do

# Now here you are
# With midnight closing in
# You take my hand as our shadows dance
# With moonlite on you skin
# I look in your eyes
# I'm lost inside your kiss
# I think if i'd never met you
# About all the things i'd missed
# sometimes it's so hard to believe

# water, forever,
# was their main complaint
# And they also threw this in my face, they said:
# Anyway, you know good and well it would be beyond the will of God,
# and the grace of the King
# So my darling and I make love in the sand,
# to salute the last moment ever on dry land
# Our machine, it has done its work, played its part well
# Without a scratch on our bodies and we bid it farewell
# Starfish and giant foams greet us with a smile
# Before our heads go under we take a last look at the killing noise

# As I was walkin' round grosvenor square
# Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
# From the other direction, she was calling my eye
# It could be an illusion, but I might as well try, might as well try
# She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
# And I knew without askin' she was into the blues
# She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
# I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls
# In the thick of the evening when the dealing got rough
# She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
# As I picked up my matches and was closing the door
# I had one of those flashes I'd been there before, been there before
# Well, I ain't always right but I've never been wrong
# Seldom turns out the way it does in a song
# Once in a while you get shown the light
# In the strangest of places if you look at it right
# Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
# Scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
# And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
# I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by

# [Verse 1]
# You at my welcome mat and I ain't mad by letting you in
# Long as you listen to me closely as you get to know Jin
# First of all I had the thirst of all rappers combined
# Worst of all people told me I was wasting my time
# Like I was better off making up computer designs
# A doctor, a lawyer, or anything that's using my mind
# When I used to rap I usually got refused and declined
# Till I felt abused and used it as fuel in my rhymes
# In every battle, the race card was my downfall
# Till I read the Art of War and used it to clown y'all
# I'm still battling but on a different note
# Not rappers, but labels, same ocean but a different boat
# Them CEOs must be sniffin' coke
# Don't they know that I'm the dopest product on either coast?
# They tried to drown me, but I stayed afloat
# Here's a verse for you to quote
# The realest shit I ever wrote
# C'MON!
# Now that I got your attention I gotta say this
# I know that it's been debated I'm a gimmick they created
# C'MON!
# All the people that hated because I made it, two-faced
# When they the same ones that wished that I'd make it
# C'MON!
# All the critics that's jealous that I've created
# Still highly anticipated they nothing to do but face it
# C'MON!
# Even though that I'm asian we all related be patient
# Cause we gon' make it so if you rollin' with me
# [Verse 2]
# We together now, we ain't gotta act like strangers
# I done let you into the deepest and darkest chambers
# Introduced you to Jin, all the pain and anguish
# Gave you reasons why they say the fame will change us
# It's most common amongst entertainers
# Rappers and athletes, how can you blame us?
# Runnin' round crazy, saying I ain't the same cause
# But jealousy, is a funny thing that the brain does
# How can you not see, in simple and plain view
# My fame ain't changed me, man it changed you
# But then again I guess that's what haters do
# And it's a damn shame my fans got haters too
# It's like the listen, and disregard the lyrics
# Imagine if they flipped it and the artist were the critic
# And everything YOU did was under the scope
# And YOUSE about to get hung, and we the ones with the rope
# [Verse 3]
# If you think about it, me and you, we really the same
# Ain't nothin' different about us but the faces and names
# The places we came, lies that were placed in our brains
# If our ancestors knew they'd be disgraced and ashamed
# So I chose to be the one to change the pace of the game
# Look at me, hot as California burnin' in flames
# Still I feel, that everything I earn is in vein
# Unless I do somethin' positive with what I obtain
# These people must truly think I'm really insane
# Like my life around me revolves around the jewellery and dames
# I'm quick to rip that picture right up outta the frame
# I ain't tryna see my whole life go down the drain
# And be, 40 years old still hoppin' the train
# Frontin' with a fake smile like I'm doin' my thang
# Hurting inside, tuck in my pride, hide in my pain
# If you've never settled for less then you feelin' the same
> Jin
# Look I'm not a gimmick, there's not a rapper I'm trying to mimic
# My life move about a mile a minute
# Make the best of it while I'm in it
# Talk sh** I'll never get offended
# I'm so pushin' to the limit
# I could shake of 20 haters
# Ignore em' and handle my business
# Highly hood got my named cemented
# A threat to every rapper in the game or that's ever been in it
# 5'6'' but I stand tall, built for war, sort of like the Great Wall
# Of China, hear my footsteps like Yao Ming's behind ya
# Don't remind me, do whatever to you, fly back and it'll be
# Hell on earth for you to find me
# They say we all look alike, cook alike
# But they aint't know that we all crooks alike
# I changed the game when I took the mic
# In Freestyle what it took for you to write, good night!
# I am here now, say what you want
# I know I got something you want
# I am here now, think what you want
# This is my life, let's get it on
# It's like a curse being successful
# The more progress, the more stressful
# Don't ask about heart, I got a chestful
# Thrown into a cesspool of sex juice
# So my next move was to elevate for the best view
# I got a few things to confess too
# They say I'm famous, I don't feel special
# Plucked from a few to be placed on a pedestal
# Only to be ridiculed and find out they want to get rid of you
# Once you near your pinnacle they try to limit you
# From the start of your career when they finish you
# That's why in interviews I keep my sh** minimal
# And if I do say something it's subliminal
# Is it because I'm signed to killers and criminals?
# It's pitiful, this rap game is too political
# But f*** it, I ain't got sh** else to do
# Yo, yo you don't gotta give me my respect, I'ma take it
# You ain't gotta punch me into night I'ma lay it
# You ain't gotta loan me no money I'ma make it
# And I do anything I can get away with
# I say what I want, take it how you take it
# Media hype that I've created has enhanced my hatred
# Came from the basement, rose amongst the stars like a space ship
# Face it, there's no replacement
# Time you spend looking for the one is time wasted
# I'm too defined, my design you can't trace it
# So give it up, I ain't bitter but I'm getting sick enough to take my contract and rip it up
# Plus my friend say I'm forgettin' stuff
# Is it cause I failed to get intouch
# While I'm out rappin', travelin', gettin' bucks
# And my hearts in Miami indeed
# Oh I ain't forget, I just got my family to feed

# Everybody has a story to tell..
# Check this out though
# [Verse One]
# I knew this chinese dude in Junior High
# part of my crew, everybody knew the kid
# he was the talk of the school, intelligent
# and well spoken, respected by teachers
# all the other students kept their eyes on his sneakers
# What can I say? You can tell he's cool if you talk with him
# during fire drills girls would wanna walk with him
# he could have any chick up in his view
# but there was only one girl he wanted to call boo
# See its all true, found himself stressed in a dead end
# the girl he was feelin was obsessed with his bestfriend
# his bestfriends a playa, thats the reason he's pissed
# plus he treat her like she don't even exist
# he ain't tryna hate on his man, but there was no help in it
# wrote the girl a letter told her how he felt in it
# she was shocked at first of him revealing the truth
# till she realized that she was feelin him too
# [Chorus: Aja Smith]
# Ohhh..
# I've been thinking of you
# Ohhh..
# I've been thinking of you
# Ohhh..
# I've been thinking of you
# Ohhh..
# I've been thinking of you
# and you've been thinkin of me
# Ohhh..
# Uh
# So you know as time goes by
# Things get a little bit serious
# Just listen
# [Verse Two]
# It was strictly hip hop, now they bumpin slow jams all day
# went from holding hands, to makin out in the hallway
# Their relationship, seemed like a dream come true
# as time went by their friendship grew
# staring at the stars, trading secrets on the phone
# when her parents were at work, she would sneak him in her room
# he told her he was a virgin the day that they met
# so on his birthday he got a gift he'll never forget
# females were jealous, but they still calling him cute
# first day of summer school, they rocked the matching nautica suits
# happy in each others arms, can it be
# they found true love, living in a fantasy
# then reality attacks, his pops couldn't see past the fact
# his son was asian, but his girlfriend was black
# imagine having to choose between the one that you love or your fam
# thats like cutting off your right or left hand, damn
# Uh huh, yeah
# I know this sounds like a true story
# coulda happened to any one of us
# it's crazy though right?
# [Verse Three]
# Now if this sounds like a true story
# that's probably cause it is
# and I know for a fact cause I'm that chinese kid
# mm, lookin back now, I know its more than just a crush
# I'm sayin the whole expierience taught me so much
# love can overcome anything that gets in its way
# thats reason I still think of shorty 'til this day
# we talk now and then, she's doin her thing
# we both full grown up, I think she rockin a ring
# I know she's proud of me and all the things I've accomplished
# She was there when I was nobody, that's being honest
# Ain't no shame, I'll admit it she was there when I cried
# So in return I wipe the tears from her eyes
# As far as my pops, he's a little more open minded
# If his son is happy, hes 100% behind it
# Now this is a song I know I had to do
# Cause all the stuff I went through might have happened to you
# Ohhh..
# Uh, yeah
# Everybody remembers their first love
# You only get one
# So you gotta remember
# yeah
# uh
# I just want you to know
# that Jin's still thinkin about you

# We May Look Different

# What Would You Do?
# Run or stand still whens your lifes on the line
# To test a mans will
# Seeking change and they found but in death
# Strangers yet they were my blood and flesh
# This happened in China,
# But you ain't gotta be asian to relate
# To the struggle, pain and hard aches
# You'll never know,
# You'll never get it,
# There is no choice,
# We can't forget it

# We see the same sky
# When we look up
# We cry the very same cry
# See, I'm a grown man
# It hurts when I turn on the news
# And see thats going on in my homeland
# This SARS epidemic, could've been lives
# Could've stand for Should Asians Really Survive
# They'll try anything to break your family apart
# Politics could break down the manliest heart
# Can the child within my heart rise above
# If theres a billion of us I shouldn't have to look for love
# Overpopulation, but damn just to meet the needs
# Its illegal to have more than one seed
# How can you dictate birth regardless the women
# And the parents they make the hardest decisions
# Sons keep their family names so thats not an option
# Imagine having to put your daughter up for adoption
# And even though its beyond your control
# Keep your head up heres a sond for your soul
# If you don't know where you came from
# You can't get the way your trying to go
# Theres ain't denying so, its true
# I got some big shoes to fill
# But If I don't lead the movement, then who will
# Stuck between a rock and a hard place
# Thinking about the refugees that went to see god's place
# 16,000 miles across the ocean tides
# Some died, some got lucky and survived
# I wouldn't call it luck, they reached their destination
# Modern day slavery without the plantation
# Them sneakers on your feet cost $100 a pop
# My peoples making 15 cents a day in sweatshops
# To make them kicks, so you can look good.
# Think we open restaurants cause we cook good?
# Hell No, we ain't got no choice
# I gotta speak up, without me my people have no voice

# See I'm a grown man
# It hurts when I turn on the news to see what's going on in my homeland
# The SARS epidemic could have been lies
# Could have stand for Should Asians Really Survive
# They'll try anything to break your family apart
# Politics are break down a millions heart
# Can a child within my heart rise above?
# If there is billion of us I shouldn't have to look for love
# Over-population, but damn just the meat the need
# It's illegal to have more than one seed
# How can you dictate birth regardless the women?
# And the parents, they make the hardest decisions
# Sons keep the family name - so that's not an option
# Imagine being forced to put your daughter up for adoption
# And even though is beyond your control
# Keep your head up; here is a song for your soul
# If you don't know where you came from
# You can't get to where you trying to go
# Ain't no denying so
# It's true - I got some big shoes to fill
# But if I don't lead the movement, than who will?
# Stuck between the rock and a hard place
# Thinking about the refugees that went to see God's face
# Sixteen-thousand miles across the ocean tides
# Some died, some got lucky and survived
# I wouldn't call it luck - they reached the destination
# Modern day slavery without the plantation
# Them snickers on your feet cost a hundred a pop
# My people's making fifty cent a day and sweat shots
# To make them kicks so you can look good
# You think we open restaurants 'cause we look good?
# Hell no, we ain't got no choice
# I gotta speak up, without me my people have no voice
# [Chorus 2X]

# [Males speaking Chinese]
# [Verse 1]
# About they never talked about the guns or the drugs
# 'Till I saw the guns and the drugs
# There is tons in the hood
# I'll admit, I never sold a sack in my life
# Watchin' "Scarface" thinkin' that was a life
# Slingin' dope or coke, respect, money and power
# But what happen when things start to go sour
# Everybody wanna see more cash
# But ego's clashin', that's when egos crash
# See the two of them started when they was in dimes
# Graduated, now they movin' bricks at a time
# Down to do whatever even wet up cops
# Tryin' to build an empire so they shut up shop
# They got themselves a connect ready to tie it down
# A buster went from Philly straight to China town
# Now there is dough poorin' heads thinkin' it's the same
# All of a sudden there is weak link in the chain
# He's a 6"2, brawler cat -- nickname Bolo
# Caught beef with his man so he had to go dolo
# But that was a no no
# You know the code of the streets; everybody gotta eat
# And that's how shit in the hood be
# Ain't sayin' it's a true story, but it could be
# For the next three months Bolo is nowhere to be found
# They say 'cause of the beef that's why he left town
# And everybody knows why they don't get along
# He's a greedy bastard - stole half a meal from Fom
# Fom is the quiet type, silent and deadly
# You play with his money now he's violent and ready
# They was partners - betrayed by his own man
# So he really gotta take actions into his own hands
# Father forgive me for the sins I commit
# But when I see that thief again, that's it
# The good, the bad, things can get ugly
# Every hustler over this money thinkin' what it should be
# Never know who, when, where, what could be
# If you still alive then you'll probably understood me
# [Verse 2]
# Meanwhile across town in a two bedroom apartment
# Bolo's going through it, baby mama through it
# All that dumb shit he be puttin' her though
# Disappear for three months plus he hittin' her too
# Now she got her bags pack then she ready to bounce
# Didn't leave a thing - not even the keys to the house
# Let her leave, he ain't talk with her at all
# Went straight for the safe behind the portrait on the wall
# He's back for his jewels, that in the cash
# Plus the sale of last few bricks he had in his stash
# Get his money right then he leavin' again
# Off to find a new life and start breathin' again
# So the deal was made and the buyers agreed
# And exchanged - they bring what the suppliers would need
# Pick a spot in China Town uncle Lenny used to own
# Dollar bills on the wall respectfully known
# Bolo went by himself even though it seem risky
# Wanted the whole cake - somethin' smell fishy
# Back in the kitchen the money was waitin'
# Deep in his heart he knew he was dancin' with Satan
# Dress in all back with gats - this ain't part of the deal
# Had a me set a mouth for the kill
# Startin' lettin' off shots now just a few here
# Sounded like firecrackers durin' Chinese new years
# Bolo's big as a truck I don't know how they miss him
# But they got so close the bullet stay there and kissed 'em
# Grab the suitcase threw a table at the goons
# Jump out a shattered window not a moment too soon
# The thugs follow and he sprayed up his ride
# Cut up from the glass but he made it alive
# Now he's back at the crib frankly they say at least
# He was just being chased by thugs and the police
# Countin' his dough sittin' on the couch' in
# Two shots to the back of the head now he slouch' in
# Fom tried to get him at the spot, couldn't then
# So he paid his baby ma' 50 Gs' to let him in
# Damn

# Allah U Akbar, everybody just be calm
# That's the word passed down from the Emonh
# It came from the Qu'ran, it can't be wrong
# It's only measure, the time, the God's eons
# So I suggest you follow Allah way
# Or turn into a bitch, inside the jungle's of raw way
# That's what the Lord say, you ain't ready for that
# You better bring a bulletproof and machete for that
# And nobody wanna be there
# They stick you with 30 motherfuckers, up in the tare
# Now it's back to the topic at hand, I'm rockin' ya fam
# And fight against the army with a rock in my hand
# A glock in my hand, divide ya body into two parts
# And change ya entire theories of God by spittin' two darts
# But I just wanna people to build
# And did Emadma Hussein, know that he would be killed?
# [Chorus 2X: Vinnie Paz, Des Devious]
# We comin' for blood (in the name of Allah)
# We comin' for blood (and we ain't playin' with ya'll)
# We comin' for blood (we destroy and rebuild)
# We comin' for blood (if you ain't loyal, you killed)
# [Des Devious]
# I got a vice grip on the mic, spittin' my shit
# My balls and arrogance alone be the cause of these hits
# Easily split ya wig, with the flick of a wrist
# Send the block, ya body's grindin' you, and to the abyss
# But that's some, sick shit, I only do when I trip
# Or when I'm, til them motherfuckers runnin' they lip
# That's when I, start the procedure, of body beatin' you into a seizure
# Your crew is standing there staring lookin' like non believers
# I felt 'em standing and staring that's when I pulled the heater
# My ratchet cookin' these faggots, I make 'em all see the
# Fact of the matter is, the cue don't back down
# This ain't no slap down, you gettin' clapped clown
# So don't be runnin' around, talkin' all this and that
# That's female shit, type of shit that get you trapped
# Into a dark corner, rope pullin' on ya
# Tried to escape, hear shots, left ya ass a goner
# [Chorus 2X]
# [Vinnie Paz]
# I'm ready to blackout, crippler crossface tap-out
# Comin' through the fuckin' door with the gats out
# Let the blood rain down and drippin' ya skin
# Let the slug hit ya crown and rip up ya limbs
# I'm the illest fuckin' rapper alive
# Give me 16 shots, I can crack you in five
# I have to survive, have to get my money and shine
# Have to get everything that I used to promise my mom
# I gotta do it for everyone that I promised something
# So everyone who thought I wouldn't be alive or something
# Come on money, that's some cold shit, wishin' me dead
# So I beat in their mid-section, til they pissin' in red

# And make me lie when I don't want to,

# Make me stay when I should not?

# And I'm worried, and I'm waking from a tormented sleep

# But you cannot bear to walk outside your door
# No, you cannot bear to look into the mirror

# Oh, my crazy baby
# Try to hold on tight
# Oh, my crazy baby
# Don't put out the light...
# The light, the light, the light
# And your hands are really shakin' somethin' awful
# As your worries climb around inside your clothes
# Oh, how long will you be sittin' in the darkness
# Heaven knows...

# On that hill a centaur stands, half stallion, half man,

# and his strength, it's the strength of a stallion,
# and his pride, the pride of a stallion.
# But his tears are the tears of a man.
# Over the hill the centaur goes,
# round the mountain and back again,
# a little too far from the world of dreams,
# and just beyond the world of a man.
# Once the centaur loved a mare who rode beside him everywhere,
# (They were) racing, chasing cross the fields,
# (the) centaur and the wild mare.
# But with the racing and chasing done,
# they stood silent and silent there.
# But the centaur, he had words to say.
# (But) the mare had only the soul of a mare.
# Over the hill he rode on,
# round the mountain and back again,
# a little too far from the world of dreams,
# and just beyond the world of a man.
# Once the centaur loved a girl who saw his golden aspiration.
# (They were) walking, whispering through the woods,
# the centaur and the lovely girl.
# But with the walking and whispering done,
# they stood silent, and then they cried.
# For the centaur felt the stirring breeze,
# He needed someone who could ride by his side.
# Over the hill, climbing the mountain and back again,
# a little too far from the world of dreams,
# and still beyond the world of a man.
# On that hill a centaur stands.

# Hindi kaya may'ron ka ng iba
# Sabihin mo na ako, ako pa rin ang iniibig mo
# Chours:
# Kailanman ikaw lamang ang aking mahal
# Kailanman ang tangi kong pinagdarasal
# Minsan pa sanay mayakap ka
# Patutunayan na mahal kita
# Kahit na saan ka man naruon
# Nais ko na iyong malaman
# Hindi-hindi kita magagawa na aking kalimutan
# Ang lahat sa ating munting nadam
# Ay turing kong tanging kayamanan
# Wala ng hihigit pa sa ating ginintuang pag-ibig

# Hey baby, you said you need someone to be there for you
# To love you all night long?
# It's kinda funny but I don't think you have to look no further
# Because I'm right here and I'm ready
# To do all the things your man won't do
# Verse 1:
# Tell me what kind of man would treat his woman so cold
# Treat you like you're nothing when you're worth more than gold
# Girl to me you're like a diamond I love the way you shine
# A hundred million dollar treasure
# I'd give the world to make you mine (la la la la la)
# I'd put a string of pearls right in your hand
# Make love on a beach of jet black sand
# Outside in the rain we can do it all night
# I'll touch all the places he would not
# And some he never knew would get you hot
# Nothing is forbidden when we touch
# CHORUS:
# Baby I wanna do all the things your man won't do (every little thing)
# I'll do them for you
# Baby I wanna do all the things your man won't do
# I'll do them for you
# VERSE 2:
# Take you out on a night cruise on a yatch just can't lose
# Cause we got a lot to look forward to one two whatcha gonna do
# What good is a diamond nobody can see
# I hear he got you on lockdown but I got the master key yeah
# I'll light up all the candles all around
# Show me to the subway I'll go down
# Nothing can be sweeter than the sound of making love
# Baby when I start I just can't stop
# I'll love you from the bottom to the top
# Nothing is forbidden when we touch baby

# I never believed in dreaming, it never got me very far.
# I never believed that love could find me, like an arrow through the heart.
# I never believed in miracles, or building castles in the air.
# Not until that day I found you, turned around and you were there.
# From the day you came, you gave me, a whole new point of view.
# I've been touched by an angel, it's impossible, but true.
# I believe in you.
# I swear that forever from today, no one will ever take your place.
# I believe in you.
# And I believe our love will last always.
# I never believed in fairy tales, tho sometimes I wish I could,
# I never believed that golden slippers could ever find the perfect foot.
# I never believed in magic, or that wishes could come true,
# But your very kiss changed all this, something only you could do.
# You made me a believer, you made me trust again,
# You showed there's a pot of gold, at every rainbow's end.
# I believe in you.
# I swear that forever from today, no one will ever take your place.
# I believe in you.
# And I believe our love will last always.
# Only love, sets you free,
# And if you serve to fate, then you're my destiny.
# Now I know, now I see.
# Anything can happen, if you just believe.
# I believe in you.
# I swear that forever from today, no one will ever take your place.
# I believe in you.

# (Verse 1)
# I try to make the best of a bad situation
# Always gave too much; You never gave in return
# Never could convince you to meet your obligations
# Guess it took me walking out before you could learn
# (Bridge 1)
# Now you wonder why I've changed
# And if any love remains
# You try to make it right with all your hugs and kisses
# But you just can't understand
# A man needs more from his woman
# It's not just money but the honey that is minning
# (Chorus)
# If you ask if I still love you
# Then I'd have to say I do
# If you ask why am I leaving
# I'd say what am I supposed to do
# What's the point in holding on if you keep on doing wrong
# Bottom line: LOVE DON'T MAKE NO SENSE
# (Verse 2)
# Monday to Friday, 9 to 5 while I'm working
# Sunday to Sunday all day you're on your back
# Day-in day-out I'm putting food on the table
# You could at least have tried to clean up your act
# (Bridge 2)
# Well I've given you that chance
# Now I'm making other plans
# I'd be better off if I was on my own
# So don't you try to change my mind
# You're out of luck and out of time
# So find some fool who's cool with that because I'm gone
# (Repeat Chorus)
# (Verse 3)
# It's a shame, but I can't remember
# The last time you held a job
# It's up to me to pay the bills
# Baby I work damn hard
# You don't think of nothing else but what you need
# YOU DON'T EXCEPT RESPONSIBILITY
# (Repeat Chorus Twice)
# (Breakdown)
# If you ask if I still love you
# Then I'd have to say I do
# If you ask why am I leaving
# I'd say what am I supposed to do
# What's the point in holding on if you keep on doing wrong
# What's the bottom line?
# LOVE DON'T MAKE NO SENSE

# Tell me when was the last time, you rubbed her feet when she said they hurt.
# Tell me when was the last time, you bought a card to tell her how you feel.
# Don't even know when was the last time, you lit a candle for a late night meal.
# Tell me,
# How long will it be before you treat her like your queen.
# And how long will it take, before she starts coming home too late.
# And how long will it be, before she starts running in the streets.
# You better the time to treat her like your lady.
# You probably don't know when was teh last time,
# You stopped to open her car door.
# And tell me when was the last time, you heard say baby do it once more.
# Tell me when was the last time, you didn't have an argument.
# Don't even know when was the last time, you told the truth about where you been.
# Now if this don't apply to you (if this don't apply to you),
# Keep doing what you do (keep doing what you do).
# But if this shoe fits you well, take a minute just to ask yourself (just 60 seconds now).
# Chorus
# Now see what's old to you, is just like new to the next man.
# What you don't do for her, she'll find somebody else who can.
# If you don't wanna lose, out on the best thing you ever had,
# You better take it from me, you'll only end up just a lonely man,
# See I know what I'm talking about.
# Chorus
# (You better run to her)

# Soon as I feel good you retards remind me
# But son, it ain't hard to find me
# I'm at ringside any time the fights on
# And I'm in the big black truck with the carolina lights on
# Or you can hop on the Pulaski Skyway
# I'm in the strip club almost every Friday
# Kats is cornballs
# Y'all dudes is bitches
# Like I ain't got enough problems with this music business
# Just give me 10 minutes
# I just need 10 minutes alone
# To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
# Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
# Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
# Give me 10 minutes
# Without y'all comin at me with that bull
# Sometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull
# And right now, that's what got the kid at peace
# Let me smoke this one cig in peace
# Some days I don't wanna be bothered
# Some days I just miss my father (damn)
# Some days I just miss my father
# Some days I wanna relapse on redline
# Cuz he'll be gone for 26 months fed time
# I try to maintain through all this
# And pray to god pop keep the same clean date and 4 dicks
# My pockets flat kid
# You do the math on $5.15 an hour full time after taxes
# That wasn't good enough to keep my MO
# Shit that wasn't good enough to complete my demo, for real
# Some days I don't wanna be seen
# And some days I don't shower, I don't wanna be clean
# Look, sometimes the truth could hurt you
# So I blow my cig smoke right at the Truth commercial
# Some days I don't wanna be bothered
# Some days I just miss my father
# And even if by a miracle he makes it half way out
# It wont be parole y'all, it be the half way house but NAH
# That's not the right path for a Budden
# Cuz we're addicts, addicts can't do half of nothin'
# Some days I'm reachin for the thing in the dresser
# Some days I'm not invincible and I feel the pressure
# Like if everyone's dependin on me, and I just stop
# ...
# Then what the fuck happens?
# I can't take that route and girl out
# And sometimes I don't wanna hear my girls mouth 'cause
# My hectic schedule, she ain't considerate
# So all I hear is the complaints and bickerin
# Radio's, studio's, photo shoot's
# She think I'm fuckin every girl that say I'm oh so cute, cute
# Don't appreciate a man and you lose him
# Worst thing to do to an innocent man is accuse him
# And I ain't with beefin' with home's
# Bran Nubian style, I had to love ma' but leave her alone
# It ain't workin out, I'll see you aight
# Just let go and let God see if we reunite
# Cuz with yo shit added to the dudes that wanna see me fall
# Nah, fuck it I wont fall
# Let me talk to all of you dudes prayin that I lose it all
# I ain't come this far to fall, fall
# But listen, I'm fucked up now
# Don't ask why y'all
# Sometimes the best medicine is just to cry y'all
# Know what I'm sayin?
# Excuse my voice fans, that should be a sign that I identify with what I'm sayin
# Cuz it's these type of thoughts that'll kill ya
# If you smokin' with me right now, then you a good way from the filter
# And I wont front like I ain't stressin'
# Sometimes I need a hug, real shit, pain shit is pain lesson (nigga)
# Just give me 10 minutes
# I just need 10 minutes alone
# To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
# Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
# Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
# Give me 10 minutes
# Without y'all comin at me with that bull
# Sometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull
# And right now, that's what got the kid at peace
# Let me smoke this one cig in peace
# Give me 10 minutes
# I just need 10 minutes alone
# To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
# Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
# Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
# Give me 10 minutes
# By myself, you the boys at home
# That's all the time I really need to enjoy my bone
# If you sparked when the song was beginnin at that time
# Then your stoge should be endin with mine
# And to you know who...
# Ma, I never saw me being with you
# But sometimes y'all dreams come true
# I'm like your number one fan
# Damn, I ain't think Joe would see you
# You's a fantasy
# I wasn't supposed to meet you, NAH
# Chances of that were so unlikely
# And if we did meet, you wasn't supposed to like me
# But look, I rap now and it just so happens
# God put me in a spot where that was just so happenin, see
# She had a man, I had a girl
# I broke up with mine and around that same time
# We was hangin out she never laid a hand on me
# But I could tell from the way she glanced at me
# Her looks said baby boy somethin hampers me
# And it would go down but I got my man with me
# Lord how can it be?
# You know I never been the dude to come and break up a happy family
# And these 2 looked so happy on the outside
# They could've only been happy on the outside
# We eventually started creepin'
# But for me it's just sex
# For her it's cheatin'
# It went down, one time, two times, once more
# Talkin real passionate, every time it jumped off
# I'm in deep y'all she's more than a jump off
# We both catchin' feelins, both startin to want more
# But guess what, she can't leave him
# Maybe it's somethin' I don't know about, maybe she needs him
# Means I still gotta front like we ain't sleepin'
# Still gotta shake his hand, I still gotta see him
# How's he supposed to look, supposed to feel for me
# He gotta know I'm feelin you, and you feelin me
# How am I supposed to look at that man with respect
# With Bleek singin 'Is That Your Chick In My Head'
# Dru Hill - 'Somebody Sleepin In My Bed'
# Aaliyah - 'If Your Girl Only Knew' reversed, but look
# Here's why I'm down and out
# I'm kinda worried y'all
# I ain't heard from him much since he found out
# ?? it wasn't mine y'all, she's still in the brain
# And I know wherever she's at, she's feelin' the same
# So 'till my fantasy dame pop up
# Everytime the cell rings I'm prayin that her name pop up, for real
# I know y'all, I ain't supposed to wife her
# But it's God's fault, I wasn't supposed to like her
# Sometimes I think, why'd I have to meet chick for?
# And some times dog, be careful what you wish for
# Some times I don't wanna be bothered
# Some days I just miss my father
# He's stuck in the system
# Treated like a dude that's heartless
# And they just transfered him, brought him up on new charges
# Yeah folks i'm back to that
# So I light another one and smoke back to back for real
# I'm chain smokin' if you ain't on my page, listen
# I'm stressed out, hopin' this one'll taste different
# Dudes hopin' that I lose it all
# I ain't come this far to fall
# Let me talk to all of you dudes wishin that I lose it all
# I ain't come this far to fall
# Nah, I wont fall
# Hopin that I lose it all
# I wont fall, nigga (nah)
# Hopin that I lose it all
# I ain't come this far to fall
# Nah
# Nah, (aint come this)
# Some days I don't wanna be bothered
# Some days I just miss my father (damn)
# Just give me 10 minutes
# I just need 10 minutes alone
# To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
# Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
# Just let me smoke this one cig in peace

# [Intro]
# Calm down... calm down...
# Baby just calm down...
# (Calm down... )
# She use to tell me to... calm down...
# Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
# Baby just calm down...
# She use to tell me to... calm down...
# Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
# (She would pray that I would) Baby just calm down...
# Calm down...
# [Budden ? Verse 1]
# Look, I was such a lost soul, just wanted to be down with something
# Look at your son now mommy I amounted to something
# You couldn't figure out, what I had messed with the streets for
# Cause you saw my genius without a SAT score
# I took drugs and laced it with things
# But you a addict yourself,
# For you I was people, places and things (how the fuck you thought)
# Angeldust use to have me in the hallways twurked
# I tried to hide it, but Visine didn't always work
# I needed someone to blame in my mind
# I thought if you and dad never used dope I would a came out fine
# And so I hit you hard when you threw in advice
# Like what I want to talk to you about you ruined my life
# You the reason why I ended up a con and I knew it
# The reason I filled my body with embomin fluid, mommy
# You the reason that my life's gone illegal
# The reason I'm kinda different, don't think like normal people, not calm
# [Chorus]
# She use to tell me to... calm down...
# Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
# (Use to pray that I would) Baby just calm down...
# You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it
# She use to tell me to... calm down...
# Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
# (You got to understand what I was going through)
# Baby just calm down...
# Everything's gonna be alright
# She use to tell me to... calm down...
# Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
# (But a nigga wouldn't) Baby just calm down...
# You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all
# [Budden ? Verse 2]
# Listen... ain't shit like seeing your moms crying on the floor
# Knowing you the reason why she ain't alright no more
# But so young, I was like whatever
# You use to chase me through the house with the knife like get your life together
# Fucking drugs, how could I ever amp on you
# And what made me think that I could lay my hands on you
# I'm not surprised that you mad at me
# Much as you hated my father, your youngest son is just like his daddy
# Mommy I live life rude, how could you not understand it
# On the same note I'm just like you
# I got moms sensitivity, my fathers balls
# His humor, his g, and my heart is yours
# Fuck school, cause I had my major
# Come to grips that it ain't so much the drugs, it's the addict behavior (no)
# Was it the dic charge, the cut that came with it
# Wasn't really the smoking, but the rush that came with it (wasn't calm people)
# [Chorus]
# She use to tell me to... calm down...
# Calm down...
# (but a nigga wouldn't) Baby just calm down...
# You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all
# (do it with me people) Calm down...
# Calm down...
# (try to understand it) Baby just calm down...
# (those kind of things) Everything's gonna be alright
# Calm down... (just bare with me for a... for a brief moment y'all)
# Calm down...
# Baby just calm down...
# You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all
# [Budden ? Verse 3]
# I felt so alone, I had a crew, but so what
# Then when Angela stabbed me guess who showed up
# And when people said I?d always be ill and twisted
# And when the therapist had told us that the pills would fix it
# Was sick of being sick, I was finally hurt
# With all the praying that you did ma, it finally worked
# God gave you a son back, I won't offend you again
# Won't let the disease turn me against you again
# Use to be high as ever, (but I) Joey Jr. got his life together
# As a result, now we tighter than ever
# So blessed, so grateful to be seeing tomorrow (see the whole world)
# That's why I can't take a drink, not if even a swallow
# I can't picture me twisted, like what I'm a do now
# Haters I can't stop yet, my mothers to proud
# Secure now, don't need to be down with nothing
# Look at your son now mommy, I amounted to something
# I'm so calm
# [Chorus]
# Calm down...
# Calm down...
# (but a nigga wouldn't calm down) Baby just calm down...
# You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all (hold up)
# She use to tell me to... calm down...
# (Use to pray that I would) calm down...
# (But I couldn't, I couldn't, couldn't do it) Baby just calm down...
# (Nothing heals like time people) Everything's gonna be alright
# (Understand that) calm down...
# Calm down...
# (Fucking miracle) Baby just calm down...
# You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all
# (They said I wouldn't reach 21 y'all... I'm still standing)
# Calm down...
# Thanks ma...
# Calm down...
# I couldn't do it without you
# Calm down...
# Calm down...
# You are appreciated
# Calm down...
# Fa sho...
# Calm down...
# It's a slow process y'all
# One day at a time though... to get beautiful

# Sing the track now, pause (QD: stop playing man bring it back now)
# Friday - I ain't gotta tuck the Eagle
# Cause I'm sliding in the back door just ta vinyl
# Saturday - we white tee, your man'll get tied up
# Later rolling pimp wit some girly and plan to rock
# Sunday - Sunday I'm catching flight on a broad
# She looked way better the night before it was kinda dark AIYOO!

# I know my dead homies watching upon us
# But uh, I aint gotta know a nigga to mourn
# See a real nigga crying it's torture
# Get the candles and the drinks
# We gon' have our own wake on the corner
# You could just vision
# All of the memories
# Hennesy guzzling and you buggin
# Cuz you was just with him
# God called for his son it was time
# You gotta have peace with the Lord
# Wish you it's on just one last time
# Some think that nothin about it is good
# He got what every nigga dreams of, he's out of the hood
# So why we all sit in the hood cryin liquer
# He's in heaven laughing like "look at my niggaz"
# They all sobbing, them tears aint stopping
# God throw em a sign and let them know I'm still watching
# Time passes and things get poppin
# Like "He woulda wanted, if he was here that woulda been his option"
# It's back to old times as if he just popped in
# You had to take somebody Jesus not him
# All my real niggaz put a lighter in the air
# There's a fighter in the air
# That cloud right there
# And I know my time is coming like everybody elses
# (But) But by then I hope that everybody felt this
# Always that one hateful nigga make it seem like everybody's jealous
# Somebody here don't like me breathin
# I know somebody here's tryna spite me steamin
# Spite how I ride these Sprees and dap me
# Goin to projects, at the end of the night I'm leavin
# One of my old mans has now burnt out
# Mic off me, never know how things turn out
# Cuz even your close friends'll steal ya
# Come to think of it, I could be real cool with my po-tential killer
# That's called taking the bitter with the sweet
# The skip with the verse
# The gift with the curse
# Somebody wants to see the kid in a hearse
# But I'll die for this rap shit, clips will disperse
# Kill for this rap shit, it gets reversed
# Murder you lethal (So)
# So don't watch if the convertable bleeds you
# Take your pick with the clips
# How you want it, reversible or see-through?
# I be another locked dog in the fort
# And another wake on the corner will be all my fault
# Another body inside the Caddy
# That'll make my Moms right cuz I'll be in jail just like Daddy
# Daddy come home, something aint right
# I think the Lord bout to call 'pon Uncle Mike
# Mike got high and he wasn't too strong
# Doc said he got cancer and it wouldn't be long
# Said in another six months he'll be gone
# Pops still play that one gospel song every morn'
# Stopped gettin high so it's no more pipe
# And they found medicine that'll extend his life
# Years past and, Mike's still here he's not hurt
# Gospel song every morn it's funny how God works
# Wait! He's got the disease, he's different again
# He's starting to get sick and shit's missing again
# Now that monthly cheque he's spending again
# Goddamn Uncle Mike is sniffing again
# Dad, Mike sprung
# And God put the cancer in his lungs like
# Fuck that cure you had a choice
# Disease is so cunning when you trippin' high
# You can't throw away the gift of life
# Nigga you take it or leave it
# Nigga play it to keep it
# Nigga safe retreated
# Cuz if the Lord come take it you heed it
# No funeral homes, not for you
# And I don't really wanna visit in the hospital
# Don't wanna see you like that cuz I'mma be too scared
# I'd rather meet my own demise and meet you There
# God I can't make pretend
# At least take me first so I aint gotta see you take my friends
# Some things I can't even figure, like why you have to take him for?
# Come on God answer me nigga
# Another tatoo, another name sprayed on the back window of the car for a month
# Another family shattered, in tears
# Another night on my knees with a new name added to my prayers
# All the things we still feelin
# Cuz on a nice day when the sky's clear I'm gon' see y'all staring
# Extend your arm, take this pound
# To all my lost soldiers in the booth with me while I lay this down

# Pop lock pussy, stop drop pussy
# Let me lay up when the block hot pussy
# Never before pussy, straight raw pussy
# Fucked ten times but I want more pussy
# [Chorus]

# Look I love sex, kind of rough sex
# Whip cream, honey out, handcuff sex
# Never without sex, all about sex
# Hard backshots, pillow in her mouth sex
# Deep stroke sex, deep throat sex
# Run around here like you don't need no sex
# All day sex, it's foreplay sex
# Your back on the wall in the hallway sex
# Make me wait sex, third date sex
# Just finished arguin, havin hate sex
# Relaxed sex, missionary style
# Nails in my back sex, now that's sex
# No hands sex, advanced sex
# Why you come to my crib wearin pants sex
# Unlikely sex, try me sex
# You gon' fuck around and be wifey sex

# And so long with raps
# See I'm depressed lately
# But nobody understands that I'm depressed lately

# And youll be hearin and seein me less lately
# Like has anyone noticed the regress lately
# Look deep nigga
# Don't I seem stressed lately

# Got a company
# That I'm signed to

# Wanna get at me
# Wanna go to war with me
# That's just one phone call from me
# Check this shit
# I got a whole hood
# That don't appreciate me
# It's not the whole hood
# That depreciates me
# What you gonna tell me
# When it's the streets that made me
# And I won't let the belly of the beast degrade me
# And then theres rap critics
# They say all I make is dance music
# But to almost anything
# You can dance stupid
# They ain't like the single
# But they ain't cop the album
# Wouldn't give a chance to it
# Not a second glance to it
# They say he whines too much
# Hes too bitter
# They call it complaining
# I call it explaining
# I know normal niggaz get caught up in the game and
# Lose they mind and y'all call it entertainment
# Its some shit with me
# And dudes been knew that
# But I'm gambling a lot and I ain't used to do that
# And then rap ain't payin the bills
# Its more money more problems
# Or its no money more problems
# Its all enormous when you playin these games
# That's how it feel to have a warrant on a famous face
# Then the albums pushed back because they say he need a
# single at the moment
# When what he need is a single moment
# Then I'm involved in the he say she say
# And that's on my mind on replay each day
# Then theres the bullshit that she say that hes gay
# But she wouldn't like to think that I ain't like her
# Just because she was throwin it at me and I ain't touch
# her
# Shell say anything sides from I ain't wanna fuck her
# I don't feel good
# So I don't wanna go to a club
# dont wanna go to a lounge
# just wanna lounge
# in the same sweats that I had on for days
# same tee I had on for a week
# what I got on it speaks
# what I got on it reeks
# no shape up
# cause but that's just how I'm feelin
# and one day at a time
# its God willin
# im tryin to see straight
# but the fog keeps building
# pulse start racing
# the bulls startin to hate me
# but I gotta be a king
# cause its wolves tryin to play me
# hoodie when its hot like its freezing winter
# rest, starve, eat and sleep for dinner
# and its hard trying keep this in ya
# So I write it all down
# So one day maybe
# When life is all sweet ill remember
# Then its probation
# I know we all go through it
# We call it pro-bation
# But there's no pros to it
# And my souls aching
# Only a few peers know
# Funny thing about the case is it's a few years old
# I had some shit going on with my dick
# It felt good but its bad
# So I'm sitting here like what the bitch had
# It's not Graph, Its real
# Look scrappy its true
# Dog whats poppin
# Do he look happy to you
# Now if it goes to the wire

# Or if you need cheddar, blast heat whenever
# And run from the cops cause you know the streets better
# Dope niggaz who rich cause they know connects
# Or dope niggaz who spit but got no connects
# If you pitch to pay rent, but get no business
# Life in the state pen but get no visits
# Fend for yourself cause you ain't got no boys
# Ride or die, cause really you ain't got no choice
# If your alibi's straight when you're wanted on the stand
# Soldiers that take they football numbers like a man
# Hustle O-Z cause your product rich there
# Hood know you snitch but you gotta live there
# You held your man shot, you don't know where it hit him
# And you tryin to buy guns, you don't know where to get 'em
# If you strapped in the streets with your palms all black
# Young G's that gotta see they moms on crack
# Pop can't be found, hand me down
# When you the oldest out of five, hold the family down
# If you caught a body and your wiz hid you out
# If you slept in the park when moms kicked you out
# Or if you gonna die, you gon' leave with a slug
# Idolized your big bro, but he was a thug
# If you squeeze in leather first cause it never hurt
# Street cats that never work cause it never worked
# Or if you got your shit snatched, ripped clipped and masked
# Too small for the kickback, but gotta get your shit back
# Killed niggaz playin, was only boxin
# Accept twenty flat as your only option
# Calm in the jungle in between the system
# If you high on parole and gotta clean your system
# If you told 'em to stop, cause soon you'll lose it
# When you pull up your pants bled, bullet wounds to prove it
# Or if you grabbed the liquor, swallow it hard
# If they drive-by on you but you follow the car
# Full clip cause your foes is lurkin; or the D's at your door
# with a picture cause you know this person
# If you dead broke, but forced into extortin
# Cause your girl pregnant and she don't want a abortion
# Got charged but 'fore strap a gun anyway
# Took the state's lawyer, but you won anyway
# Stand up cats beat the odds by far
# Real recognize real, R.R.R.
# Don't mistake a amped up nucca.. for what?
# For a stand up nucca.. I won't
# If you a stand up nucca.. then what?
# Then stand up nucca.. R.. R.. R..
# Basically, that's about it...
# Hope you people get a better understanding...
# And roll with me... geah!

# [Chorus]
# Come and take a walk with me...
# I need all of y'all to come and take a walk with me...
# I need for all of y'all to feel what I'm going through
# And see what I see, if you got time to take a walk with me
# Wait a minute now...
# Shit ain't like I thought it would be
# Come to Jersey from New York with me
# I know you busy...
# But take the time out to walk with me
# Pay attention on this tour with me
# Maybe I'm seeing something wrong
# Come along and make sure with me
# Come and take a short walk with me
# [Joe Budden - Verse 1]
# Yo... I'm seeing a couple things wrong with the way that I'm living
# So come and walk with me I just need a second opinion
# Introduce you to my friends I got to see if you notice
# If they loyal or if they all got an ulterior motive
# See some snake niggaz, me and them don't deal anymore
# Ever since I got signed I don't know whats real anymore
# I'm paranoid so excuse me if I seem to be nervous
# But everybody from my past now they trying to resurface
# Trying to rekindle, They don't think I know they gone limo
# I got cousins I never knew they trying to pass me a demo
# Maybe I'm wrong, like I told you main I need your opinion
# Me and him never spoke before so I don't see whats so different
# Dudes I don't know they recognize me start extending they hand
# And I'm tripping ready for beef when he was only a fan (why?)
# Cause these niggaz in my hood say they don't like how I'm reppin'
# Let me know how strongly you feel, will I be needing my weapon
# As some sort of protection, should I carry a pen and pad
# And ask everybody in the fucking hood for they suggestion
# I'm letting the labels know that Jersey City is gifted (dog)
# When they didn't know that Jersey City existed, but it's cool dog
# Certain cats in Jersey City so hateful (Hateful)
# And certain cats in Jersey City ain't grateful (Ain't grateful)
# All they say is I don't chill anymore
# Ever since I got signed they don't think I'm real anymore
# I'm told I shouldn't be alone cause I'm a star in my hood
# Something might happen now, they know who you are in the hood, they do
# So I can't tell you how I feel anymore
# Ever since I got signed I can't tell what's real anymore, you feelin' me dog
# [Chorus]
# [Joe Budden - Verse 2]
# See to me it's heavy, but to you it may seem petty
# Let's continue walking, I know you ain't tired already
# I take you to meet my girl I got to see if you notice
# If she love me or if the bitch got an alterial motive
# Why am I hated cause I handle my business
# Ain't got to look for a girl nowadays cause almost all these niggaz is bitches
# See 'em often while we walking I'll show you the drug dealers
# and some dudes that hate me word on the streets is they real killers dog
# Where was the hate back when I wasn't on my feet
# An alcoholic, school dropout, just a bum on the street
# Where was the hate during my adolescence
# Back when that psychiatrist was trying hard to get me on immanic depression so man
# I don't recall none of this happenin' back then
# And I don't understand I was still rappin' back then
# So I got to ride with a gun
# From trying to get my mom and pop up out of the slums and provide for my son
# If you met my baby moms would you notice
# If she was ready for a child of if her ass had an alterial motive
# I don't know what she's teaching Trey but everyday he get older
# Angie's bitter and feel like now that I'm successful I owe her
# Cause she would hold me so tight when I was ready to relapse
# Tell me to relax, I ain't know no better straight out of rehab
# Bottom line I was lonesome
# But we was wrong for each other, Angie I grown some
# Got bigger issues, if you went to Def Jam would you notice
# If they was out for my best interest or do they just see a dollar in Joseph? (Ugh)
# Guess I ain't sure how I feel anymore
# Ever since I got signed I can't tell what's real anymore
# I mean them same record execs that wanted me in
# Don't care that I'm the next nigga, they just wanna see spins I swear
# Guess I ain't sure how I feel anymore
# Ever since I got signed I can't tell what's real anymore, you feelin' me dog

# I got a drug problem, but I ain't tell the truth

# then it's back to pcp and solong with rap
# see I'm depressed lately, but nobody understands

# but y'all been hearin and seein me less lately
# like it's anyone noticed the redress lately
# look deep nigga don't I seem stressed lately
# seem disturbed, alot of repress lately
# I got a company that I'm signed to
# but they ain't in my company, when all I need is some company
# when I start feelin like everybody's done with me
# I tryna see what everybody want with me
# then the mistress, yeah, the girl from ten minutes it's hard
# now I'm needing ten minutes from heart
# I can't get into it, but I want y'all to know
# that I'll get into it, but I'll save that for the growth

# that's just one phonecall for me
# check the shit, I got a whole hood, that don't appreciate
# it's not the whole hood that appreciates me
# what you gon tell me, when it's the streets that made me
# and I won't let the belly of the beast degrade me
# and then it's rap critics, they say all I make dance music
# but there almost anything you can dance to it
# they ain't like the single, so they ain't copped that album
# wouldn't give a chance to it, not a second glance to it
# they say he wines to much, he's too bitter
# they call it complaining, I call it explaining
# I know 'em niggaz cooked it, caught up in the gaming
# lose they mind and y'all call it entertainment
# some shit with me, a dude's been knew that
# but I'm gambling a lot and I ain't used to do that
# rap ain't payin the bills, it's mo money mo problems
# or it's no money mo problems
# all enormous when you play at these stakes
# that's how it feels to have a warrant on a famous face
# then the album's pushed back, cause they say he needs a single at the moment
# but what he needs is a single moment
# then I'm involved in the 'he say she say (that)
# send my mind on replay, each day
# then it's the bullshit that she save he's gave
# cause she wouldn't like to think that he ain't like her
# just cause she was throwing it at me and I ain't touch her
# she'll say anything psych, but I ain't wanna fuck her
# I don't feel good, so I won't wanna go to a club
# don't wanna go to a lounge, just wanna lounge
# then the same sweatster that I had on for days
# the same t I had on for a week what I got on, it speaks
# what I got on, it reeks
# no shape up, chilling, cause that's just how I'm feeling
# and one day at a time, it's god willing
# tryna see scrape but the fall keeps building
# post start raising, the booze starting that gate me
# but I gotta be a king cause this wolve's tryna play me
# goodie when it's hot like it's freezing winter
# bed start, eating sleep for dinner
# then it's hard tryna keep this in ya
# so I write it all down, so one day maybe when life is all sweet I remember
# then it's probation, I know we all go through it
# we call it probation, but there's no pro to it
# yeah my soul's aching, only a few peers know
# funny thing about the case is it's a few years old
# had some shit going on with my ohh, that felt good but it's bad
# so I'm sitting here like what the bitch had
# it's not rap it's real, look scrappy it's true
# going what's popping, do he look happy to you
# now if it goes to the wire, go the soul of a fighter
# bruised up and sloppy, a damaged like Ali
# up late talking to the fans on a website
# that's the only thing that send yo man off to bed right
# fuck the world fuck my moms and my girl
# well maybe not mom, just let me remain calm
# this too won't last, this too shall pass
# at least that's what I say yall, that's what I pray for
# and I'm the only thing that's standing in my way yall
# but I gotta be with me, it's no escape yall
# I guess depression just stepped in, and took over shit like it's known to do
# Guess it said, hey Joe, I'm going home with you
# Turn your phone off, I need to be alone with you
# I need to be in the zone with you
# Cuz I'm the only thing y've grown to, nigga
# Look, I own you, nigga
# Been with you since 10, but you starting to confuse me
# cause it's been so long and you still tryna lose me
# Like how could you show me such cruelty
# When everybody turns their back on you, Joe it's you and me
# Still you don't want me to see you right
# And why you always come get me, how we re-unite
# huh, I know you feel for me deep in your heart
# Doctors, meetings, pills couldn't keep us apart
# What, now, you got a deal and you wanna get rid of me
# We roommates, I'm in your head, Joe you live with me
# So I don't write for the fans, nah, I write to my man
# And hope that he'll just leave and understand
# Like, like please leave the kid in peace
# Let me smoke this one cig in peace
# Just leave for a second, man it's been too long, and I can't troop it

# It took 5 women 2 getcha off of my mind
# It took 5 months, a plenty good wasted time
# But it just took 5 minutes when I saw your face again
# 2 fall in love all over, I guess with U I'll never win
# March was a cold one in more ways than one
# Went down 2 the nightclub lookin' 4 the sun
# Lookin' 4 a light that could brighten up a day
# That's been darker than a hole since U went away
# April usually brings showers
# This time it was a hurtin' kind
# This woman said she wanted my baby
# I told her I'd have 2 be deaf, dumb, and blind
# 2 fall in love with someone that I barely knew
# The baby would never really have a father
# Cuz I still, cuz I still, cuz I still, still, still, huh
# Be stuck on U
# It took 5 women 2 getcha off of my mind
# Get off my mind, baby
# Fallin' in love all over... U I'll never win
# May was her name, she was jumpin'
# Jumpin' from plane 2 plane
# Actress or model or somethin'
# Can't even remember her first name
# June brought an Easter bunny
# Needless 2 say, hmph, that girl was late
# Told a made-up story 2 a busy-body of our only date
# What a sketch!
# July was a heartbreak, extraordinary
# Said I met this woman whose kiss was somethin' scary
# It felt so much, so much like yours
# But it only made me, made me want U more
# She's gone, she's gone but U're still here
# I want U very..., huh, it's U I fear

# And so it was that later
# as the miller told his tale
# that her face, at first just ghostly,
# turned a whiter shade of pale
# She said, 'There is no reason
# and the truth is plain to see.'
# But I wandered through my playing cards
# and would not let her be
# one of sixteen vestal virgins
# who were leaving for the coast
# and although my eyes were open
# they might have just as well've been closed
# She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
# though in truth we were at sea
# so I took her by the looking glass
# and forced her to agree
# saying, 'You must be the mermaid
# who took Neptune for a ride.'
# But she smiled at me so sadly
# that my anger straightway died
# If music be the food of love
# then laughter is its queen
# and likewise if behind is in front
# then dirt in truth is clean
# My mouth by then like cardboard

# Went into the land of the midnight sun
# Searchin' high, searchin' low
# Searchin' everywhere I know
# Askin' the cops wherever I go
# Have you seen dignity?
# Blind man breakin' out of a trance
# Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
# Hopin' to find one circumstance
# Of dignity
# I went to the wedding of Mary-lou
# She said 'I don't want nobody see me talkin' to you"
# Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
# About dignity
# I went down where the vultures feed
# I would've got deeper, but there wasn't any need
# Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
# Wasn't any difference to me
# Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
# House on fire, debts unpaid
# Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
# Have you seen dignity?
# Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
# In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
# Lookin' into the lost forgotten years
# For dignity
# Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
# Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used
# He wanted money up front, said he was abused
# By dignity
# Footprints runnin' cross the silver sand
# Steps goin' down into tattoo land
# I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
# In the bordertowns of despair
# Got no place to fade, got no coat
# I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin' boat
# Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote
# About dignity
# Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure
# Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
# And into every masterpiece of literature
# for dignity
# Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
# Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
# Bites the bullet and he looks within
# For dignity
# Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
# Dignity never been photographed
# I went into the red, went into the black
# Into the valley of dry bone dreams
# So many roads, so much at stake
# So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake
# Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take
# To find dignity

# On this winter's night
# I sit on feelings
# That hang in suspense
# Nothing in my life makes sense
# A question mark hangs with the stars up above
# As I'm driving home to the one that I love
# Sometimes I can't see the trees for the wood
# Loving you tonight feels good
# Loving you tonight feels good
# Loving you tonight
# Loving you tonight
# The moonlight changes
# From red into white
# It sits on treetops
# Asleep for the night
# I see the signpost
# The road slowly bends
# Nothing in my life makes sense
# A flashing tail light speeds across the sky
# My head's cooking trouble as thoughts seem to fry
# The last temptation was misunderstood
# Loving you tonight feels good
# Loving you tonight feels good
# Loving you tonight
# Loving you tonight
# I'm faced with the ultimate truth
# What if I see that things don't improve

# We met one summer evening
# As the sun was going down
# She was lying on the beach
# In her graduation gown
# She was wrapped up in a blanket
# (I could tell she knew her way around)
# And as I lay down beside her
# You know she never made a sound
# On down the beach came the beach-cleaning man
# Scoopin' up the papers and flattening down the sand
# "Lucinda, Lucinda, Lucinda - we've got to run away
# That big white truck is closin' in
# And we'll get wounded if we stay"
# Now Lucinda lies buried 'neath the California sand
# Put under by the beach-cleaning man

# A poet in his madness tries to find another line

# And they look from such a height
# That somehow it's all right
# They're talking back to the night
# It's all that they can do
# Talking back to the night
# It's how they make it through
# If you listen you can hear them
# Their voices draw you near them
# They're talking back to the night for you

# His dream is getting smaller and he wonders where to turn
# And he's trying hard to make it
# And he's trying not to burn
# Woman never minds, pulls the shade and draws the blinds
# She takes him in the darkness where the loneliest can feed
# She gives him all she has to

# When a word like love
# Offers so much fear
# I've got mine, you've got mine
# The lines all drawn, the time is now

# Tonight, we'll cross that great divide
# No turning back

# Posluš rafale za anale, skoz kanale grem v finale,

Skoz pozitiva, kot cannabis sativa, gotiva, gajba piva, zraven moja iskriva diva, ni blo izziva, dokler barva siva ni postarala slik iz mojga zapečatenga arhiva, smrt ni zanimiva, '' viva la vida '', svetloba me obliva, optimizem upanja vliva. Muzka in lajf je stvar okusa in stila, do kam pot me bo vodila pa je že usoda določila, moj cajt moja pravila, ne morš zajebat smrti, uživam dokler lohk, ko bom na vrsti bom na vrsti, ljubim moje male, lepe, zdrave otroke, familija vesela, srečni držimo se za roke. Rokam za dan, ko dobro z dobrim vrne nam, tole repam zdej tud zate pa čeprav si daleč stran, repam dobre volje, srečen, ker živ in zdrav in vem da tudi jutri vse bo kot je najbolj prav.

# Gremo 1, gremo 2, gremo 3, ne se bat, še zmer je dost lepih stvari. Muvamo na floru, pa družmo se med sabo, veš poet svoj dolg? Povem velik je še pred tabo. Gremo 4, gremo 5, gremo 6, sej vse veš, smejem se, vidm vas, pa hodm peš. Rad mam produktivno delo, rad veselje, upam da se vam izpolnejo vse skrite želje!
# Refren:Vanish:
# Gremo 7, gremo 8, gremo 9, Z vami je poet od pozitive vs zadet, izklopmo internet in plesišče bo cel planet, spet druženje realno ne virtualno kot je Svet. Gremo 10, spet od 1 do 10, Lepo je verjet v neki, za kar je vredno umret. Ne zgubljam besed, probam sanje ujet, lajf je treba ožet in vsak trenutek živet.

Ko bijem bitke, so zmage in porazi, zmaga pametnejši, ki do kraja vse pregazi, v končni fazi, boli me kdo je taprau, prvi ki se prebije, vedno kri ščije vs krvav. Rad bi me izzval, nisi med top izzivalci, ne morš ker si amater, nisi med profesionalci, sveznalci bi betl, ne ubadam se s tabo, pod sabo mam damo, v čakalani vrsti tvojo mamo. '' Tud mi to znamo '', lapajo eni in isti, nismo pa vsi isti kot avioni na pisti, eni neki nardimo, drugi so šleperisti, z mano so tisti, ki smo skup naučil gristi.

# My father died
# a year ago today
# the rooster started crowing
# when they carried dad away
# there beside my mother
# in the livingroom I stood
# with my brother and my sister knowin
# dad was gone for good
# Then I, I hung around just long enough
# to lay him in the ground
# then I caught a plane to do a show
# up north in Detroit town
# because I'm older now
# and I ain't got not time to cry
# I got no time to look back
# I got no time to see
# the pieces of my heart that have been ripped away from me
# and if the feelings start to come in I've learned to stop them fast
# cuz I don't know if I let em go they might not wanna pass
# and there's just so many people
# tryin to get me on the phone
# and there's bills to pay and songs to play
# and a house to make a home
# I guess I'm older now
# and I ain't got not time to cry
# I can still remember
# before I heard of Merle
# so many things have changed
# so much here in my world
# I remember sitting on the front porch
# when an ambulance drove by
# just listening to those sirens I would break down and cry
# now I'm walkin and I'm talkin
# doin just what I'm supposed to do
# working overtime to make sure I don't come unglued
# Because I'm older now... and I ain't got not time to cry
# I sit down on the sofa and I watch the evening news
# there's a half-a-dozen tragedies from which to pick and choose
# the baby that was missing was found in a ditch today
# and there's bombs flying and people dying not so far away
# I'll take a beer from the fridgerator and sit in the yard
# with a cold one in my hand I'm gonna bite down and swallow hard
# Because I'm older now and I ain't got not time to cry
# Its true
# I'm older now
# Just ain't got not time to cry
# No time to cry

# Somewhere in Vietnam
# a nineteen year old soldier stumbled from a bar room
# he said I must be seeing things
# that bourbon hit me like a baseball bat
# In Belfast, Ireland a little lady dropped her shovel in her garden
# as she raced across her yard to ask her neighbor Mrs. Clancy
# 'what was that?'
# In Memphis, Tennesse a teacher raised the window closest to the river
# and the children in her classroom swore they heard a choir singin down the street
# In Washington, D.C. a private secretary's lips began to quiver
# and the President just put aside some papers and rose quickly to his feet
# I lay in a cheap motel in the arms of someone else's woman
# when a loud explosion rocked the room and turned the morning into night
# I jumped out of bed and ran into the street with hardly any clothes on
# and as the sky lit up my heart stood still and I could feel my face turn white
# All at once the clouds rolled back and there stood Jesus Christ in all his glory
# and I realized the saddest eyes I'd ever seen were lookin straight at me
# I guess I was awakened by the penetrating sound of my own screaming
# it didn't take me long to stumble out of bed and fall down on my knees
# as tears rolled down my face I cried 'Dear God I'm thankful I was only dreaming.
# If I never go to hell Lord its because you scared it out of me.'

# It's what I was born to do
# You see me up there center stage
# In the spotlight for awhile
# But in the things that really matter
# I'm just sitting on the isle
# Cuz I've seen a third grade angel with
# Dark circles 'neath her eyes
# Not a trace of hair left on her head
# Sayin daddy don't you cry
# A single mom workin overtime
# A college kid reading to the blind
# When you look for heros know that I'm just a singer in a band
# I'm thankful to be living in
# This childhood dream come true
# But sometimes the attention just leaves me confused
# Hey, I love my t-shirt on those kids, my name there up in lights
# But when the show is done and I'm on the bus riding through the night
# I think of third grade angel with
# Dark circles 'neath her eyes
# Not a trace of hair left on her head
# Sayin daddy don't you cry
# A soldier in a field of mines
# With each step he lays it on the line
# When you look for heros know that I'm just a singer in a band
# I'm humbled when you take the time
# To hear my life in verse and rhyme
# But when it comes to heros I know I'm just a singer in a band

# And I know it's only in my mind
# That I'm talking to myself and not to him
# And although I know that he is blind
# Still I say there's a way for us.
# I love him
# But when the night is over
# He is gone, the river's just a river
# Without him the world around me changes
# The trees are bare and everywhere the streets
# Are full of strangers
# I love him
# But everyday I'm learning
# All my life I've only been pretending
# Without me his world will go on turning
# A world that's full of happiness that I have
# Never known.
# I love him, I love him,
# I love him, but only on my own.

# Silence in the darkness creeps into your soul
# Envy moves the light of self control
# The gate that holds you captive has the door
# Burnin' with determination to even up the score
# Heart's on fire, strong desire, rages deep within
# Heart's on fire, fever's risin', high
# The moment of truth draws near
# Time will not allow you to stay still, no
# Silence breaks the heart and bends the will
# Defense is guilty passions out of control
# Rules and regulations have no meaning any more
# Heart's on fire, strong desire, rages deep within
# Heart's on fire, fever's risin', high
# The moment of truth is here
# OH!
# Is here
# Oh yeeeeeaaaaaah!

# So, you think you're untouchable?
# Word life--this is Basic Thugonomics
# Word life--I'm untouchable but I'm forcin' you to feel me
# Whether fightin' or spittin' my discipline is unforgiven
# Got you backin' up in the defensive position
# An ass-kcikin' anthem, heavyweight or bantam
# Holdin' camps for ransom, a microphone phantom
# Teams hit the floor this the new fight joint
# Like a broken needle kid you missin' the point
# We dominate your conference with offense, that's no nonsense
# My theme song hits, gets you reinforcements
# We strike quick with hard kicks, duckin' night sticks
# Bare-knuckled men through fight pits, beat you lifeless
# Never survive this, you forgot like all-timers
# Two-faced rappers walk away with four shiner
# It's a one-rhymer, turnin' legends to old-timers
# My incisors like a vipor bitin' through your one-liners
# New DeadMan Inc., and we about to make you famous
# Takin' over Earth and still kickin' in Uranus
# You ain't advanced enough to process,potential for medical concepts
# Some objects are foreign, like Loch Ness
# Arts and sex are complex regardless of your finesse or fitness is the condition of business
# Your lame vision of a underground physical image
# You're underneath to undermine your whole typical image
# With the precision of percentages and the collision of sentences
# Poetry beats your mics
# We untouchable like righteous s***s with no crevasses
# Streets unite, we rock righter with dumber beats
# You cats couldn't come this hot ? in the summer heat
# Forget two takes--kill your birds the first time
# You better stay worthy of my filler of worse rhymes
# I'm better than nice, check the veterans twice
# You be beside your self with fear
# I'll kill you and bury you twice despite the cover of night
# Trackin' ya flight like guerrilla warfare
# When the grass is dense
# Approaching me is a quick way to get referred to in the past tense
# Dead-da, when the lights, the mic is on
# The crowd is dead like intermission and you on the Titan Tron

# What now?
# Preachin on the way that they handle thing
# Watin patiently to do the 6-foot Sand Thing
# Now, so I take a second look at my life
# I made too many mistakes that I just couldnt make right
# Should've been more focused than I take things light
# When I'm gone this is what y'all will say I was like
# An arrogant fool, no not that baddest or cool
# Just a big fish caught up in the shallowish pool
# Not a big name playa, in fact its true
# Never wanted this shit without the kats he knew
# He got lucky rode the coattails of everyones fame
# In two weeks aint nobody gon' rememba his name
# Fuck It
# I'm ready to go, I done made records
# Made monetary off of the flow
# More importantly though, I proved everyone wrong

# I want y'all to feel the wound, its the truth in my words
# I been quiet for too long, the truth should be heard
# It was a while back, 10:20 in the morn'
# Kat should up on my lawn in the rug-ed uniform
# Unexpected, theres a knock on my door
# I met this fool in the club, I don' see him before
# Open to great him, but the second he sees me
# His eyes buckle, his voice is uneasy
# But it's cool, I didn't even catch it at first
# I check his shoulder, homie's rockin a purse
# Now I know something's tricky, but I'm already sittin down
# Homie pipes up, you should hear what he's spittin out
# Says I've been sleepin wit his wifey
# And he ain't the type of kat to take that shit lightly
# I made a move and he told me homie wait
# Reached in his purse pulled a chrome 38
# He asked me if I'm ready to die
# Said he was gonna blow my brains all over the sky
# Said he was leavin the country, and he was straight with the passports
# Cocked the hammer, I'm thinkin my last thoughts
# I'm in a bad way, nothin could save this.
# I close my eyes hopin it's painless
# Just waitin for the sound, ready to swallow too
# But homie havin trouble with his follow through
# By a miracle, I avoid the chalk ground
# Homie's confused, he just wanna be talked down
# His wife is sleepin through town and he knew it
# Picked me outta the crowd but couldn't do it
# He Squashed it, and as he's walkin away
# I realize life is short so I'm markin the day
# Now it's full speed ahead, I'll rest when I'm dead
# And I could give a Fuck what the next man said
# I live how I wanna live
# Buy what I wanna buy
# Do what I wanna do
# Try What I wanna try
# Fear nothin, take chances
# Not afraid to fail, always makin advances
# So when I ride on the Grim Reaper Highway
# No regrets bitch, I did it my way
# Yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
# What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
# Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
# So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
# What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
# What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
# Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow

# This is just another day in the life

# Everybody askin me - what you really like?
# Is this really life? Do you really fight?
# Do you fear the mic, when there's millions watchin?
# Are you super rich now, how much grip you coppin?
# You the new kid, now you gettin some shine
# When every vet sayin that it's not yo' time
# My hustle is non-stop and it's not yo' grind
# Plus I hear very clear, I'm not so blind
# Beef I don't sweat it, sleep I don't get it
# I remember your face it's just your name I forget it
# These days they melt together as one
# I got some plans to do shit that ain't never been done
# Take this game into battles that ain't never been won
# I ain't gon' walk through life, I think it's better to run
# And yeah I'm eatin right if you askin
# But the size of my wallet that's reflection of passion
# [Tha Trademarc]
# Just another face in the crowd, so to speak
# Huh, my electric was cut off last weak
# No heat, no food, no money, no girls
# And if life's my oyster then I ain't found pearls
# Makin moves every day so the ends could meet
# No gas money, so I use my legs and feet
# Everybody I meet man, they likely saw
# that I be in the same clothes from the night before
# Shoes so old you can call 'em retros
# Man I'm so damn broke, even my wallet echoes
# I got a dollar and change; man, I'm under the gun
# That buck's the only thing keepin me from bein a bum
# That's why I'm writin these words man, so I can get on
# So I can realize bein poor was makin me strong
# And the only reason I can't rub pennies together
# is cause I carry big bills, in genuine leather
# Shakin hands with some fans by the thousands
# My place so poor, looks like public housin
# Gettin the Porsche when I shoulda got the CL6
# My ride broke down, I'ma kinda between whips
# Face on the X-Box, you played the game lately?
# Man I can't rent, I owe too much in late fees
# Do I, charter a jet, or fly first class?
# Do I take a cab?  Bus seats hurt my ass
# Pay my jeweler in cash, he don't take a check
# The chain I rock, leaves a green mark on my neck
# Do I get the filet steak or the shrimp & crab mix?
# Do I get a number 3 or a number 6?
# Get in the club V.I.P. man they lettin me slide
# Man they bust me for dress code, I'm still outside
# Everybody wanna be down, but I ain't got no friends
# Man nobody's around, I ain't got no friends
> John Cena
# [John Cena]
# Yeah
# You can't help but feel it
# Can't help but feel this one
# Uh-huh uh yeah
# Excuse me for a minute while I lighten the mood
# Just clap with me like the lightning do, yeah
# A bit of soul food that you be bitin into
# And if you feel me then I'm writin for you, uh-huh
# Right now put another coat of wax on the ride
# For a minute put the beef and the gats to the side
# Cause this track's got a vibe to chill to
# Enjoy life for 5 minutes, man it's not gon' kill you
# It's okay to be hard and stay true man
# But at the end of the day, we all hu-man
# This one's for you, the ones that you close to
# Show some love, it's what you supposed to
# Right now, forget the ends and the Benz
# Pop a cold one, man toast it wit'cha real friends
# Call your folks, tell 'em you tight now
# Cause everything lookin pretty good right now
# [Chorus - sped up vocal sample]
# [Tha Trademarc]
# Right now baby, we all gon' ride
# So place those things on your hips or side
# The soul vibe gon' change, give way with fame
# But sometimes the moral change or stay the same
# Relax baby, right now you here
# And sit back baby, with a round of beer
# And cheer to those friends who crowded near
# For those passed on in spirit they there
# It's gon' be what it must, break bread wit'cha crew
# If you got kids take the crust
# It's all love baby, tell your girl she's strong
# And whisper in her ear after dinner it's on
# And take it slow baby, cause everything real
# When you at family dinner y'all enjoy that meal
# Thank God that you healthy and you keepin it tight
# And keep your dreams lighthearted when you sleepin at night
# [Chorus - sped up vocal sample]
# [John Cena]
# Yeah - and right now I'm showin love to my brothers and my old man
# To my girl, "Let's Get it On" like the slow jam
# To everybody that I'm runnin down the road with
# Y'all my family, I know that you know this
# Fox, Rock, B's and Chaos
# Y'all growin up with me man, true to life players
# Grandma or grandpa watchin up above
# Trademarc you my heart cousin, nothin but love
# [Tha Trademarc]
# Thanks momma, for all that you was
# You a strongarm lady baby crazy with love
# My sister raised me, those are the facts
# And taught me how to rebuild when the order collapsed
# And right now I'm blessed no stress no less
# And thanks hip-hop for givin me back focus, huh
# Yeah John, what can I say?
# It's all love from day one, you showed me the way

# You like a proctologist, you feelin my shit
# Yeah - you all hype like a street team
# I spend more time holdin a mic than Mean Gene
# Makin beat fiends scream, they be lovin the click
# Roll solo to the party but I leave with ya chick
# Cause she know that when I'm flowin it's hot
# There's a party in my pants, she be blowin the spot
# Buck naked in the old school drop, givin me skull again
# She give me free strokes, that's why I call her a mulligan
# See me on TV, knows everything about me
# You can't fuck with me, she can't fuck without me
# And if you think she don't be lovin my thangs
# That's like sayin you eat at Hooters for the buffalo wings, what?
# [Tha Trademarc]
# Fuck record execs, promisin checks
# I been cleanin tables now I'm seein labels, these chicks
# sayin "haven't we met," man holdin my breath
# Feel like the lesser of two evils that I haven't seen yet
# I got girls runnin game with a pimp strut
# Big butt booty bitches tryin to link up
# They walkin toward me, conversation and they body bore me
# I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
# Nas said it before, that's raw
# If you leavin the club your clothes'll end up on the car floor
# Man, I got no time for words after sex
# I just kick you to the curb and be laughin next
# Cause Trademarc is a clingy chick's nightmare
# Even though you took me home, I won't spend the night there
# I've had hookers to virgins, on they back
# Wild sex all the way to dead lays like necrophiliacs
# [John Cena]
# Johnny Cena got the girls, girls but I'm not Jay-Z
# I play the field, I never let the field play me
# You see my Chevy?  You know there's ten chicks aboard
# Plus the whip got more switches than the mixer board
# I'm stickin your whore, while you flossin your Range
# Gave her a dollar, she gave me back a buck and some change
# She tried to swallow me whole, I brushed the back of her wig
# She called my dick Frank White cause it's +Notoriously B.I.G.+

# A soldier, and I stay under you fightin
# Plus I'm stormin on you chumps like I'm thunder and lightning
# Ain't no way you breakin me kid, I'm harder than nails
# Plus I keep it on lock, like I'm part of the jail
# I'm slaughterin stale, competition, I got the whole block wishin
# they could run with my division but they gone fishin -
# - with no bait, kid your boy hold weight
# I got my soul straight, I brush your mouth like Colgate
# In any weather I'm never better your boy's so hot
# you'll never catch me in the next man's sweater
# If they hate, let 'em hate, I drop ya whole clan
# Lay yo' ass DOWN for the three second TAN
# [Tha Trademarc]
# Yeah, uhh
# It's gon' be what it's gon' be
# Five pounds of courage buddy, bass tint pants with a gold T
# Uhh - it's a war dance and victory step
# A raw stance is a gift, when you insist it's my rep
# John Cena, Trademarc, y'all are so-so
# And talk about the bread you make but don't know the recipe for dough though
# Aimin guns in all your photos, that's a no-no
# When this pop, you'll liplock, your big talk's a blatant no-show
# See what happens when the ice age melt
# You see monetary status is not what matters, but it helps
# I rock a timepiece by Benny if any
# The same reason y'all could love me is the same reason y'all condemn me
# A man's measured by the way that he thinks
# Not clothing lines, ice links, leather and minks
# I spent 20 plus years seekin knowledge of self
# So for now Marc Predka's livin live for wealth

# And I'm a savage in the booth
# I'm on some movement shit, about to rally up the youth
# Number one seed daddy walkin through the playoffs
# You better quit rappin 'fore I start makin layoffs
# Fuck a day off, I'm movin heavy for the payoff
# You don't ride to this?  We don't need you, stay off
# Hate on this?  I don't care what you said
# Y'all can choke on a shit sandwich with no bread

# I don't smile as such, buddy, ain't much funny
# You touchy girlie rappers claimin that you fuckin gully
# I live poor but look rich, I hit raw, you look bitch
# You love me, that's why you got your style from me
# Most sayin Marc Predka's overconfident
# It's only cause they jeally that my profile is prominent
# The dominant factor is the money I'm after
# Your opinion ain't mean shit buddy - I ain't ask ya
# It's gon' be what it's gon' be
# It is what it is and was what it was so watch ya wordplay
# Trademarc lay you where the buzzards and birds play
# I write rhymes 'til ya boy is heard mayne
# Cause alls I got, is my voice and word
# Sophisticated rapper the dapper lover the don
# It's on baby pah yeah word is bond
# Cut the check and I'll rock, every word of the song - what now?
# [John Cena]
# Yeah, yeah... yeah
# I got that velcro flow, I'll make you stick to this
# So many zeroes, my monetary is ridiculous
# A glass of Chardonnay doesn't whine like you
# I'm an Altered Beast with Einstein's IQ
# Plus I shine bright too and I ride right through
# In a leaned out, old school, skylight blue
# I don't think there's a player nice
# Keep your Cristal, I'm shoot Jagermeister
# Foot to the floor and you ain't you keep the pace
# Throw me a whore and call me Kobe cause you know that I'ma beat the case
# I buy some land, and never even see the place
# Vegeterian chicks, go on givin meat a taste
# Throw away money like I hate on loot
# Copped your CD it sounds great on mute
# Words turn 'em to dust makin MC's disintergrate
# My name get traffic like the California interstate, what?

# That's like playin roulette and bettin on blue
# Cena gon' blow - you goin no place
# Snatch your dame, show her my old face
# Still walk tall with a staggered stance
# Plus I hold on the club like I was Bagger Vance
# Make you breakdance for me, have you doin headspins
# Ship you to D.C., covered in Redskins
# Catch me in a classic drop low with the wine paint
# Plus I'm classic on the flow, every line great
# Believe me, yo the speech is tight
# I lay you down like when you sleep at night, big business
# [Tha Trademarc]
# Y'all are cowards y'all found power and cower
# The gunpowder a thousand shots an hour leavin blocks devoured
# Have your family prayin for your survival
# Bust shots and get cops bent out control like a spiral
# Man get the fuck on if you got bangers involved
# Man get the fuck on and keep your chambers revolved
# Man get the fuck on and get your weight up
# Man get the fuck on or you get laid up
# Sippin BNB out the sceptre
# It's not Trademarc to you dog it's still mister
# Sophisticated, and Marc's never stuck up
# I know when to shoot my mouth off and when to shut the fuck up
# Every rhyme I write, worth bitin
# Every room I'm in, worth micin
# I'm artistic, you must have missed it
# When I said every rapper sucks I was bein optimistic
# [Tha Trademarc]
# Trademarc's mind is dilated
# Highly rated, madly envied, that mean we kindly hated
# The nightcrawler brawl and have you missin
# when we drag your body out to sea like fishermen
# and takin everything that's glistenin
# So run your chain or your dame, it's all the same

# I... will get by
# Touch the sky, time to fly, 'til we die
# [Tha Trademarc]
# For what it's worth I see the purpose of life
# I see below the surface and the version that you know and hold is not right
# Hahaha, man I oughta just laugh
# The only darkness ahead of me's the shadow I cast in my path
# (What's that?) That's the weight of my craft
# I breathe easy, and let my chest slowly contract
# And write rhymes to inform baby not to uplift
# If you wanna make it all, you gotta persist (yo put me on)
# Yeah, all that talk's a waste
# Cause I can read a man's thoughts by the way the lines cross his face
# Hold five, everything live
# And I vibe, ain't nobody thought this day would arrive
# But I balance my talents with a hope and a drive
# And ride beats dog, that's where my focus derive
# And keep notepads and vocab, that's my guide
# And if I got legit beef, I don't let it slide - what now
# [John Cena]
# My brain is impossible to thinkin philosophical
# Hustle in my blood, that's the only thing that's logical
# The only thing I gotta do to stay on or stay strong
# I ain't stoppin 'til I own the field that y'all play on
# Desperado - eyes like a bird of prey
# Cold soldier - crack snap your vertebrae
# No heater - flow sweeter than Cohiba
# Cinnamon dip, spice ride in the cinnamon whip
# Quite wide on the benjamin clip
# Might slide but we ain't gonna slip - no way
# If the meek shall inherit the earth, guess what?
# Y'all get the globe if they measure in, lyrical worth
# Trademarc flow first, make the mental work
# Fuck a verse - I rearrange your dental work
# And when it pop off, we not soft
# We like the Bentleys; y'all just the Chrysler knockoffs
# [Tha Trademarc]
# But that's life, yeah you hearin me right
# It's like I had to find the black of night
# come back to life with master insight that shine bright - I'm always learnin
# My burden, to blow up gifts like this, I must endure the slow burnin
# It's sort of strange, my philosophy's changed
# I take chances, jump before the water's in range
# And never wait for safe answers so if all that remains
# is lookin back at my life it never seems like I wasted glances
# Man it's all a big game, that's why it doesn't mean a thing
# That I get money and fame, it's all the same
# if you call me Trademarc or if you know my real name
# Marc Predka ain't attached to ego
# He's a hero for the average people, a blessing
# Who transcends the essence of a poet with a street flow
# It's not lip service I don't speak to hear myself talk
# And I don't wanna be a teacher; I'm grateful for all I've been taught

# Do y'all know what time it is when everybody game

# My mic will be the dame, written or off the brain
# I show up with my chest pumpin hard like Notre Dame
# I lose then I regain, hustle is in the vein
# I'm drinkin protein shakes to muscle up the brain
# In the black Chevy Suburban sippin champagne
# with champagne, d*** out doin the damn thang
# We movin in the fast lane, with them black thangs
# On the way to the Bronx, to do the ski-mask thang
# I don't know what's so funny cause I ain't laughing
# The part is for a dead body, guess who's casting
# [John Cena talking over sample]
# Alright bro, I'm hearin you

# And be, effective

# And that's how it's been baby cause you ain't know how
# You move your pen lazy maybe or your beats don't pound
# I move quicker than the word on the street go 'round
# I write down every lesson that my peeps hold down
# You let your heat go blaow if you ain't speak profound
# I write sixteens down 'til I hit green now
# Makin up slang, ain't know what sh** mean now
# Trademarc, Marc Predka, jot the real name down
# You can catch it on every marquee in town
# Sayin Trademarc, ain't nobody like you now

# You may be signed but you don't know what the f*** you doin
# I make aight hot, I make dope raw

# You know the only rap pimp that kept a ho poor
# And slam a fool on his back and break the whole floor

# Stones on my wrist, and a chip on my shoulder
# Sixteens cashin in on another hot beat
# Go cop me a drop with the butterscotch seats
# And we better not meet, if we do you gon' see a change
# Make sure you whole FACE gettin rearranged

# This my 9 to 5, this ain't no hobby cat
# Copycat killers bite styles, my rhyme piles is heavy
# Give me a beat, man I'll body that
# Spittin that heat street raps man they nod to that
# What you smilin at? You R&B, man that's hardly rap
# You lost the beat, man you bought a map
# Matter fact, here's my next rap, borrow that
# Been off the street too long, I want my corner back
# You ain't a player, you a armchair quarterback
# You ride the beat like side streets on a flat
# Don't play dumb, I know where you came from
# You only seen slugs buddy after the rain come
# Keep it subtle, Trademarc got you bi***
# like babies suckin tits talkin 'bout mami let's cuddle

# You fill up my senses
# Like a night in a forest

# Like a walk in the rain
# Like a storm in the desert
# Like a sleepy blue ocean
# You fill up my senses
# Come fill me again
# Come let me love you
# Let me give my life to you
# Let me drown in your laughter
# Let me die in your arms
# Let lay down beside you
# Let me always be with you
# Come let me love you
# Come love me again
# . . . Let me always be with you
# Come let me love you  Come love me again

# I'll walk in the rain by your side
# I'll cling to the warmth of your hand
# I'll do anything to keep you satisfied
# And I'll love you more than anybody can.
# And the wind will whisper your name to me
# Little birds will sing along in time
# Leaves will bow down when you walk by
# And morning bells will chime.
# I'll be there when you're feeling down
# To kiss away the tears that you cry
# I'll share with you all the happiness I've found
# A reflection of the love in your eyes.
# And I'll sing you the songs of the rainbow
# A picture of the joy that is mine
# The leaves will bow down when you walk by
# And morning bells will chime.
# I'll walk in the rain by your side
# I'll cling to the warmth of your tiny hand
# I'll do anything to help you understand
# and I'll love you more than anybody can.
# And the wind will whisper your name to me
# Little birds will sing along in time
# The leaves will bow down when you walk by
# And morning bells will chime.

# It's five o'clock this morning and the sun is on the rise
# There's frosting on the windowpane and sorrow in your eyes
# The stars are fading quietly, the night is nearly gone
# And so you turn away from me, and tears begin to come.
# And it's goodbye, again
# I'm sorry to be leaving you
# Goodbye, again
# As if you didn't know
# It's goodbye, again
# And I wish you could tell me
# Why do we always fight when I have to go?
# It seems a shame to leave you now, you lay so soft and warm
# I long to lay me down again and hold you in my arms
# I long to wipe the tears away and bring you back the smile
# But other voices beckon me and for a little while...
# And it's goodbye, again
# I'm sorry to be leaving you
# Goodbye, again
# As if you didn't know
# It's goodbye, again
# And I wish you could tell me
# Why do we always fight when I have to go?
# Have to go and see some friends of mine
# Some that I don't know
# Some who aren't familiar with my name
# It's something that's inside of me
# Not hard to understand
# If anyone will listen to me sing
# And if your hours are empty now, then who I am to blame?
# You think if I were always here, our love would be the same
# But as it is the time we have is worth the time alone
# And lying by your side the greatest peace I've ever known.
# And it's goodbye, again
# I'm sorry to be leaving you
# Goodbye, again
# As if you didn't know
# It's goodbye, again
# And I wish you could tell me
# Why do we always fight when I have to go?

# I’ve been lately thinking about my lifetime

# And I can’t help believing in my own mind
# and oh I’m gonna hate to see it end
# I’ve seen a lot of sunshine
# slept out in the rain
# spent a night or two all on my own
# I’ve known my lady’s pleasures
# had myself some friends
# Spent a time or two in my own home
# I’d like to say it now it’s been a good life all in all
# it’s really fine to have a chance to hang around
# Right there by the fire
# and watch the evening tide
# while all my friends and my old lady sit and pass the pipe around
# talk of poems, prayers and promises and things that we believe in
# how sweet it is to love someone
# how right it is to care
# How long it’s been since yesterday
# what about tomorrow and what about our dreams
# and all the memories we share
# The days they pass so quickly now nights are seldom long
# Tide around me whispers when it’s cold
# changes somehow frighten me
# still I have to smile
# it turns me on to think of going home
# For though my life’s been good to me
# there’s still so much to do
# So many things my mind has never known
# I’d like to raise a family I’d like to sail away
# And dance across the mountains on the moon *

# He was born in the summer of his 27th year
# Coming home to a place he's never been before.
# He left yesterday behind him. You might say he was born again.
# You might say he found the key to every door.
# When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
# On the road and hanging by a song.
# Well the string is already broken and he doesn't really care.
# It changes fast and it don't last too long.

# Well he climbed the feeble mountains.  He saw silver clounds below
# He saw everything as far as you can see.
# They say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun.
# He lost a friend but keep the memory.
# Now he walks in quiet solitude thru the forests and the streams
# Seeking grace in every step he takes.
# His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
# The serenity of clear blue mountain lake.
# And The Colorado Rocky Mountain High
# I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
# Talk to God and listen to the casual reply.
# Rocky Mountain High
# Rocky Mountain High
# Now his life if full of wonder
# But his heart still knows some fear
# Of the simple things he cannot comprehend.
# Why they try and tear the mountains down
# To bring in a couple more, more people, more scars upon the land.
# And The Colorado Rocky Mountain High
# I've seen it raining fire in the sky.

# It's funny how you sound as though you're right next door
# When you're really half a world away
# I just can't seem to find the words I'm looking for
# To say the things that I want to say
# I can't remember when I felt so close to you
# It's almost more than I can bear
# And though I seem half a million miles from you
# You are in my heart and living there
# And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see
# It's the same old sun up in the sky
# And your voice in my ear is like heaven to me
# Like the breezes here in old Shanghai
# There are lovers who walk hand in hand in the park
# And lovers who walk all alone
# There are lovers who lie unafraid in the dark
# And lovers who long for home
# Oh, I couldn't leave you even if I wanted to
# You're in my dreams and always near
# And especially when I sing the songs I wrote for you
# You are in my heart and living there
# And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see
# It's the same old sun up in the sky
# And your face in my dreams is like heaven to me
# Like the breezes here in old Shanghai
# Shanghai breezes cool and clearing evening's sweet caress
# Shanghai breezes soft and gentle remind me of your tenderness

# They say they love each other
# I've no doubt they do
# They say they'll always be together
# That may not be true
# They come from different places
# Different points of view
# They find themselves in different spaces
# Everything is all brand new
# Two different directions
# Too many different ways
# One always on the road somewhere
# The other one always stays
# Too often unhappy
# Too often on your own
# When you are moving in different directions
# True love is all alone
# Old stories start to surface
# Patterns from long ago
# And loving quickly turns to anger
# For reasons they don't even know
# The strongest heart can be broken
# With one insensitive word
# The deepest feelings remain unspoken
# No one is seen and nothing heard
# Two different directions
# Too many different ways
# One always wants to work things out
# The other one wants to play
# Too ready for changes
# Too much that just can't wait
# When you are moving in different directions
# True love can turn to hate
# If opposites attract each other
# What's the reason for
# One being like an open window
# One just like a closing door
# Two different directions
# Too many different ways
# One likes to see the morning sunrise
# The other one sleeps in late
# Too many tomorrows
# Too many times too late
# When you are moving in different directions
# True love may have to wait
# If you are committed to different directions
# True love will have to wait

# Oh Montana, give this child a home
# Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own

# Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
# Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes

# I can't remember where I went
# Where I was
# I'm gonna move toward a point in time
# Where where you are is a state of mind
# And anytime I can read your thoughts
# Some of them yours and some of them I thought up
# There's no good reason for a heartbreak
# Nothing's repeating every Monday
# It's no good saying you'll always be mine
# These jokes life's playing it makes me so tired
# It's already to much to always seen you off
# The sense that hours go back is enough
# I like to fade when I write this line
# There's every reason to paint a decline
# And every mile I walk is five
# I'll get where I'm going in the next life
# And all the while there's a false face
# This every killing is left untraced
# This kind of falling saved my son
# This constant longing for what's gone
> John Frusciante
# I'll know her face a mile away
# You'll be there in the slaughter
# Freeing me when I'm cornered
# Being arrested by the mind cops
# They're the only ones worth changing what you do for
# And I try to be in line
# I guide my fate
# And what it's good for there's no telling
# It's blood
# It's a flood
# I'll know here face a mile away
# She'll take my straight through that gate
# Living there in a flower
# You wouldn't have made it whitout her
# Though she seems to stay in one place
# She grows whit you life
# So cry for time
# What's slow and fast at the same time
# It comes to life
# And if it dies
# You'd never notice cuz it
# It slides as it climbs
# I'll know her face a mile away
# And I'll know my pain's a life away
> John Frusciante
# For changing lines
# I've got no time tonight
# In these times the wind surpasses the tide
# when the wake ups hard to find
# dreams make up for your life
# This crazy shine it never lets you die
# Going up
# We become what we want
# Again the moon rises up too high
# And we don't need the sky
# Wonder what it is that makes the world turn slower
# wonder what it is that makes me feel so mad
# everyone that talks to me I so wish wouldn't
# I wouldn't even care exept I feel so bad
# why is there noone in my life
# time
# there's no time tonight
# Wide
# there's no room to see wide
# Time
# There's no time tonight
> John Frusciante
# Rain on your mind
# If I'm so inclined
# It's left you all
# At there photo stall
# One blast, my fast
# So you wanna know, where youre gonna go?
# So you wanna know, where youre gonna go
# And all you want
# To be is a God
# You're safe as that
# My friend go back
# Of time, time
# So you wanna know, where you're gonna go?
# So you wanna know, where you're gonna go?
# So you wanna know, where you're gonna go?
# So you wanna know, where you're gonna go?
# There's only death
# And I say that yet
# This life is a frontier of pain
# Disgust, disgust
# So you wanna know, where youre gonna go?
# (Walls)
# So you wanna know, where youre gonna go
# (Walls)
# So you wanna know, where youre gonna go?
# (Walls)
# So you wanna know, where youre gonna go?
# (Walls)
# Once I'm cornered, I can't center
# I will go beyond
# Plans to kill me seem to falter
# I am not my own
# Eyes can't see me or the others
# You do things our way
# Extra meaning, truth won't free them
# Not worth a thing I say
# Hey
> John Frusciante
# You'll make it through the day
# See things another way and behold
# Listen to wednesday's song
# This night you go home alone
# How the sane go upright
# How you look another night
# You're back under my hat
# And even knowing that you're a w****
# Nothing ever meant more
# That switching rooms through a door
# Out into another one
# Frames flash inward
# And you know
# I have seen the world enough
# I've drowned in my thoughts alot
# I canceled heaven I concede
# Another word to say
# When everything's O.K you go down
# And pulling up the slack
# And never coming back
# An alarm
# Ringing to set the sun
# No one ever becomes
# What others thought they shoul've been
# Inside they're what they can see
# You know I do miss this girl
# To show I am in a swirl of sun
# Being what I've got
# The joy
# I canceled heaven I concede
# Everything that I belive
# I canceled heaven I concede
> John Frusciante
# There's one room
# There's one light
# There's one night
# In the fire
# In the pain
# In the wire
# This from me
# This one lie
# That seems right
# Time can't climb
# It can't be
# It can't see
# I see to be right
# I fall down tonight
# I go to hell to be what I sell
# Falling again is such a welcome end
# Can the end of today be more than tonight
# Echoes of these far reaching sights
# Stuck with the pain of knowing you should have tried
# Give me your hands
# And we'll never die
# This love song
# It sits wrong
# It means jack
# The time's right to be wrong
# All night long
# I feel good
# I feel so far away
# This is mine
# It could be anyday
# I saw what I saw
# I call up a man
# Distance is what gets me right in
# I had a hand in everyone losing their place
# Never must stop
# It's stealing my heart
# A moment to squeeze begging on its knees
# I know I'll never be right beyond tonight
# Give me your hands
# And we'll never die
> John Frusciante
# Do you throw it in the well
# Wishing you had someone to tell
# What it was that you wished for
# So it couldn't come true anymore
# I've thrown so much away
# These times die and stay alive
# I've gone and i've stayed
# And though both happened
# At the same time
# I know which one i like
# And which one i hate
# You never change to fire if you're ice
# Even if you melt on a table and dry
# And that table is burned
# I'll tell you why
# 'Cuz you stayed by going away
# And life changes not you
# Life changes not you
# Every time is contained in now
# Now is only time anything happens
# Though one moments shot
# In infinity's rounds
# Now is the one time
# Anything happens here
# Here, here, here
# Here, here, here
> John Frusciante
# You're warning me to get out of the way
# Was the safest thing to say
# This trying to get out of a tight spot
# Isn't even worth a shot
# And all of the world calls out at once
# give us pain
# It's a friend to us
# And we don't decide for ourselves very much
# what we are we owe to the fear of love
# Don't bring it around
# I've reached for that
# Once it is called when you're married
# and you've fallen out of love
# What's it called when the family
# you raised you don't know at all
# Give us a point to miss
# endings are killing me slow
# I only ask for this empiness replace my soul
> John Fruscuante
# Learning there's nothing to gain from advice
# Hey doubt, come on around any time
# Anyhow mistakes are what lead you through life
# Down and out's only if you think up and in's right
# I've gone along with the sins that are versions of you
# But guidelines were all i had time to get through
# It's like reading of love that's gone wrong
# If time was laid out like that
# Everything would occur at once
# And all the laws were laid down twice
# And the clouds were doubled in the sky
# And being tall meant lacking height
# And being wrong and being right
# You're perfect
# You fit snuggly right in the lie
# One host is going to teach how to die
# Lay down
# The darkness tonight is so bright
# Reasons
# There's one for each time cars collide
# I hear that telling moments divide
# And the only important moments
# Are the in between times
# And being confused is an exercise
# I'm missing your thoughts tonight
# But we reach out to what's out of our sight
# I'm missing your thoughts tonight
# But we reach out to what's out of our sight
> John Fruscuante
# We make the music that divides you
# It's handed down as a thing to cry to
# And all my wars they treat you kindly
# There's nothing more important that i see
# There was a time when all was empty
# Unorganized a clog a death scene
# Things opened up and there's so many
# Paths to walk ports of entry
# Now that I'm gone
# Now that i'm long gone
# This minute has come and gone
# I never said to do anything but forget me
# I can't be lost
# I've learned everything form loss
# For what's gained there's an inner cost
# I won't pay it i never would
# We left the seasons back in Long Town
# There was a hint of sadness going round
# We met the brothers who drove arrows
# And shot assumptions wide and narrow
# I know i mean what i'm forgetting
# We give for everything we're getting
# A lot that hasn't been put away
# It's building up for that fateful someday
# Now that i'm gone
# Now that i'm long gone
# This minute has come and gone
# I never said to do anything but forget me
# When it seems i'm around
# Check again what's up and what's down
# Any silences make a sound
# before the equation i'm the answer

# Save a little for me
# Won't you save a little
# Save a little for me - ohh
# This just might hurt a little
# Love hurts sometimes when you do it right
# Don't be afraid of a little bit of pain
# Pleasure is on the other side
# Let down your guard just a little
# I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
# Hold on to me - pretty baby
# You will see I can be all you need

# You're a beautiful boy,
# With all your little toys,
# Your eyes have seen the world,
# Though your only four years old,
# And your tears are streaming,
# Even when your smiling,
# Please never be afraid to cry,
# You're a beautiful boy,
# With all your little ploys,
# Your mind has changed the world,
# And your now forty years old,
# You got all you can carry,
# And still somehow empty,
# Don't ever be afraid to fly,
# All you beautiful boys,
# Creating multiple plays,
# You like to fence in your world,
# And settle down when you're old,
# You can run from pole to pole,
# And never scratch your soul,
# Don't be afraid to go to hell and back,
# Don't be afraid to go to hell and back,
# Don't be afraid to be afraid.

# <br>Or is it harder to find
# <br>I feel like I'm in the dark

# No it ain't been the best of weeks, But it

# Goes good with beer
# And the Friday night atmosphere
# Of this cross town bar where
# The cars all get steered to
# And it goes hand and hand
# With my crazy buddies and this three piece band
# And the pretty girls and the games we play
# And the smoke and mirrors
# Yeah, troubles come, but they go good with beer
# Bring all your debts and all your bills
# Load up your mountains and your molehills
# Come as you ain't or as you are
# Don't forget that broken heart

# Bring all those stories you can share
# Just like the peanuts and the pretzels on the table there

# Darling I have a true confession
# <br>I ran into an old flame today
# <br>You wouldn't like the way our conversation
# <br>Turned to how we let each other slip away

# <br>One I shared with her so long ago
# <br>Since honesty is one thing we believe in
# <br>Let me tell you something you should know
# <br><br>Oh how she shines
# <br>Shines a light on you
# <br>And in that light I see
# <br>Just how much you mean to me
# <br>Oh how she shines
# <br><br>There was a time when she was all that mattered
# <br>Long before I gave my heart to you
# <br>But standing there only inches from her
# <br>She touched my hand and suddenly I knew
# <br>If there was a time I ever doubted
# <br>What I'd do if she walked through my door
# <br>Could I turn around and leave without her
# <br>With all my heart now I can say for sure
# <br><br>Oh how she shines
# <br>Shines a light on you
# <br>And in that light I see
# <br>Just how much you mean to me

# Her parents never took the young girl to church
# Never spoke of his name, never read her his words
# Two nonbelievers walking lost in this world
# Took their baby with them, what a sad little girl
# Her daddy drank all day and mommy did drugs
# Never wanted to play, or give kisses and hugs
# She'd watch the T.V. and sit there on the couch
# While her mom fell asleep and her daddy went out
# And the drinking and the fighting
# Just got worse every night
# Behind their couch
# She'd be hiding
# Oh what a sad little life
# And like it always does the bad just got worse
# With every slap, and every curse
# Until her daddy, in a drunk rage one night
# Used a gun on her mom, and then took his life
# And some people from the city
# Took the girl far away
# To a new mom and a new dad
# Kisses and hugs every day
# Her first day of Sunday school the teacher walked in
# And a small little girl, stared at a picture of him
# She said I know that man up there on the cross
# I don't know his name, but I know he got off
# Cause he was there in my old house
# And held me close to his side
# As I hid there behind our couch
# The night that my parents died

# Summer lovin' had me a blast - summer lovin', happened so fast
# I met a girl crazy for me - I met a boy, cute as can be
# Summer days driftin' away, to uh-oh those summer nights
# Tell me more, tell me more, did you get very far?
# Tell me more, tell me more, like, does he have a car?
# She stood by me, she got a cramp - he went by me, got my suit damp
# I saved her life, she nearly drowned - he showed up, splashing around
# Summer sun, something's begun, but uh-oh those summer nights
# Tell me more, tell me more, was it love at first sight?
# Tell me more, tell me more, did she put up a fight?
# Took her bowlin' in the Arcade - we went strollin', drank lemonade
# We made out under the dock - we stayed up until ten o'clock
# Summer thing don't mean a thing, but uh-oh those summer nights
# Tell me more, tell me more, that you don't got her preg
# Tell me more, tell me more, cause he sounds like a drag
# He got friendly, holdin' my hand - well she got friendly, down in the sand
# He was sweet, just turned eightteen - well she was good, you know what I
# mean
# Summer heat, boy and girl meet, but uh-oh those summer nights
# Tell me more, tell me more, how much dough did he spend?
# Tell me more, tell me more, could she get me a friend?
# It turned colder, that's where it ends - so I told her we'd still be friends
# Then we made our true love vow - wonder what she's doin' now
# Summer dreams ripped at the seams, but oh, those summer nights
# Tell me more, tell me more.

# Well, September comes around like an old familiar friend
# So I take off to Central Park to watch those falling leaves again
# And in the arbours of Strawberry Fields, in a night as bright as day
# I look up at the sky and wish I could fly away
# And I say I know this life won't last forever
# But wherever you go these days
# I'm with you all the way
# And I say I know your time and mine together
# Is more than I could understand
# But I promise you, I'll always be your man
# And so I watch those falling leaves until the winter kicks in good
# Until I reach the same conclusion
# We never say the things we should
# You're with me all the time it seems, yeah, these days I'm not alone
# I can't explain the things I'm going through, it's you not me that's flown away
# Chorus
# And time has put us through some heavy changes
# And I say I still care about you and I know what love's for
# And I'll be right here waiting for you every day
# To come in laughing through that door
# Look up at the towers through the falling snow
# It's hard to tell what you've been going through
# Because I'm a stranger now in your world
# And I give anything to understand the rules again
# Chorus
# Day in day out, I have no doubt
# I'll always be your man

# All I ever wanted was to get away
# And spend some time alone
# To a big house in the country
# To a private yacht with Wall Street on the phone
# And in a million dollar paradise
# Maybe I could sing a better song
# But I've found something different now
# And I finanlly understand
# That money gets you everything
# But it slips straight through your hands
# And it's love that makes the world go round
# And it's nationwide from town to town
# It gets you coming up and going down
# And it makes everything alright
# I'd give you everything and that's a start
# To get next to you and the keys to your heart
# There's something going on here
# Something going on behind your eyes
# You got me feeling kind of nervous
# With that Mona Lisa smile
# And maybe I could get a steady job
# Bring home the bacon 9 to 5
# See I'd do anything to win you
# Anything at all, I've got my cards
# Down on the table, baby
# We could have a ball!

# Well I come home in the evening
# To the same old house alone
# And in the silence of these empty rooms
# I take shelter from the storm
# But I bought a paint box
# And some brushes to pass the time
# Since you've been gone
# It's a portrait of a broken man
# And the colours always run
# A figure in a landscape
# It's a work of art, you'll see
# A figure in a landscape
# It's a masterpiece of loneliness, that's me
# Well I climb the stairs in this haunted house
# To find your spirit everywhere
# With the bright stars on the rooftops
# And my old friend the moon is there
# But I can't quite get the colours right
# See I'm reaching for the deepest blue
# It's a one man show, I'm free again
# But still belong to you

# With your ghost and memories
# Got what I wanted I got my freedom
# But I miss you still

# There's diamonds in the avenue
# As the dayshift turns to night
# In the Empire diner dreaming
# Hard rain, fluorescent lights
# As the waitress fills my coffee cup
# And the working girls go by
# Drenched Irish cops are dreaming sex
# And peep show alibis
# Everything underneath the skyline
# From the east side to the west
# I see the miracle in real time
# And there's one I've loved the best
# See there's an angel on the D train
# As she's flying to my world
# And I'm wiating for a New York City girl
# Times Square looks like Avalon
# In a Disney morphine dream
# Dylan Thomas rides a white horse drunk
# At the counter next to me
# I wake up in the bed sometimes
# And watch her as she sleeps
# In the silence and the sirens
# I pray her soul to keep
# Chorus
# The catherine wheel burns bright tonight
# Down on the avenue
# But nowhere near as bright, my love
# As the fire that burns for you
# Everything underneath the skyline
# From the east side to the west
# Of the lives I've lived and those I've known
# There is one I've loved the best
# See there's an angel on the D train
# As she's flying to my world
# And I'm wiating for a New York City girl

# In the middle of some abandoned Shoney's parking lot
# Ripping off the filters off her cigarettes
# Crying, he loves me, loves me not
# She checks her makeup in the rearview mirror and turns the radio on
# It hasn't hit her yet
# But all she's looking at is another lonely night coming on
# Everybody learns the hard way
# The hard way about love
# It's easy to think that there's something better out there somewhere
# But make no mistake
# Everybody learns the hard way about love
# all she's got
# Out on the tiles, out on the edge
# He's gonna give it his best shot
# All that hard earned money ever got him was all alone
# It's two in the morning and the only thing that's falling is the rain
# And it's a long walk home
# Everybody learns the hard way
# The hard way, yeah
# The hard way about love
# It's easy to think that there's something better out there somewhere
# But make no mistake
# Everybody learns the hard way about love
# Everybody learns the hard way about love
# And in the cold heart light of day
# Romeo doesn't always get his Juliet
# You take your hands off the wheel
# Your eyes off the prize
# You'll get a lesson that you won't forget
# Down on your knees and regret

# Just walking in the rain
# Getting soaking wet
# Torturing my heart by trying to forget
# Just walking in the rain
# So alone and blue
# All because my heart still remembers you
# People come to their windows,
# They always stare at me
# Shaking their heads in sorrow
# Saying, Who can that fool be
# Just walking in the rain
# Thinking how we met
# Knowing things have changed
# Somehow I can't forget.

# Well I left in Kentucky back in '49
# and went to Detroit workin' on an assembly line,
# the first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs.
# Everyday I'd watch those beauties roll by
# and sometimes I'd hang my head and cry,
# 'cause I always wanted me one that was long and black.
# One day I devised myself a plan
# that should be the envy of most any man.
# I'd sneek it out of there in a lunchbox, in my hand.
# Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired,
# but I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired,
# I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand.
# I'd get it one piece at a time,
# and it wouldn't cost me a dime,
# you'll know it's me when I come through your town.
# I'm gonna ride around in style,
# I'm gonna drive everybody wild,
# 'cause I'll have the only one there is around.
# So the very next day when I punched in
# with my big lunchbox and some help from my friend,
# I left that day with a lunchbox full of gears.
# I've never considered myself a theif
# but GM wouldn't miss just one little piece,
# especially if I strung it out over several years.
# The first day I got me a fuel pump,
# and the next day I got me an engine and a trunk,
# then I got me a transmission and all the chrome.
# The little things I could get in my big lunch box,
# like nuts and bolts and all four shocks,
# but the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home.
# Now up 'till now my plan went alright
# until we tried to put it all together one night,
# and that's when we noticed that something was definately wrong.
# The transmission was a '63,
# and the motor turned out to be a '73,
# and when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone.
# So we drilled it out so that it would fit,
# and with a little bit of help from an adapter kit,
# we had that engine runnin' just like a song.
# Now the headlights, they was another sight,
# we had two on the left and one on the right,
# but when we pulled out the switch all three came on.
# The back end looked kinda funny, too,
# but we put it together and when we got through,
# that's when we noticed that we only had one tailfin.
# About that time my wife walked out,
# and I could see in her eyes she had her doubts,
# but she opened the door and said "Honey, take me for a spin."
# So we drove uptown just to get the tags,
# and I headed a ride on down main drag,
# I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around.
# But up there at the courthouse they didn't laugh
# 'cause to type it up it took the whole staff
# and when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds.
# I'd get it one piece at a time,
# and it wouldn't cost me a dime,
# you'll know it's me when I come through your town.
# I'm gonna ride around in style,
# I'm gonna drive everybody wild,
# 'cause I'll have the only one there is around.
# Uh, yeah, Red Rider, this is the Cottonmouth,
# in the Psycho-Billy Cadillac, c'mon.
# This is the Cottonmouth, and negatory on
# the cost of this mo-chine there, Red Rider.
# You might say I went right up to the factory and picked it up,
# it's cheaper that way.
# Uh, what model is it? It's a '49-'50-'51-'52-'53-'54-
# '55-'56-'57-'58-'59 automobile.

# Tell me where did I belong?
# And it’s all for the love
# of a dear little girl
# All for the love that sets your heart in a whirl

# And the joys of this world
# All for the love of a girl.

# I am a question to the world,
# Not an answer to be heard.

# And what do you think you'd ever say?
# I don't listen anyway:
# You ignore me,
# And I'll never be what you want me to be.
# And what do you think you'd understand?
# I'm a boy, not a man.
# You can take me and throw me away.
# And how can you learn what's never shown?
# Yeah, you stand here all alone.
# They don't know me 'cause I'm not here.
# And I want a moment to be real,
# Wanna touch things I don't feel,
# Wanna hold on and feel I belong.
# And how can the world want me to change,
# They're the ones that stay the same.
# The don't know me,
# 'Cause I'm not here.
# And you see the things they never see
# All you wanted, I could be
# Now you know me, and I'm not afraid
# And I wanna tell you who I am
# Can you help me be a man?
# They can break me
# As long as I know who I am
# And I want a moment to be real,
# Wanna touch things I don't feel,
# Wanna hold on and feel I belong.

# They're the ones that stay the same.
# They can't see me,
# But I'm still here.
# They can't tell me who to be,
# 'Cause I'm not what they see.
# And the world is still sleepin',
# While I keep on dreamin' for me.
# And they'll want to just whispers,
# And lies that I'll never believe.
# And I want a moment to be real,
# Wanna touch things I don't feel,
# Wanna hold on and feel I belong.
# And how can the world want me to change,
# They're the ones that stay the same.

# You know the story
# You read the books
# Boy meets girl
# Then they fall forever in love
# But I know better
# So here goes a tale
# Of the realest of the real
# Listen
# Now once upon a time in a small world
# It was everything that I dreamed of
# He was my gem and I was his pearl
# Nothing could come between us
# A prince charming to call my own
# Until the day that he broke my heart
# And left me wonderin all alone
# Pickin my mind and soul apart
# Used to believe in love (I used to believe in love)
# Used to believe in fairy tales (In fairy tales)
# Since my heart's been crushed (It's been crushed)
# Just don't believe in a tiny hell (No no no no no)
# Don't know which way to turn
# Figure it out for myself
# I've just started to learn (La da da dee, oh)
# There's no such thing as fairy tales
# Is a good story supposed to end
# Unhappily ever after
# Just as wonderful as it begins
# And carry on for a few chapters
# Baby how come each time I open up
# I can't seem to get past stage one
# I guess it's time for me to close up
# And go back on the shelf because I'm done
# Used to believe in love (I used to believe in love)
# Used to believe in fairy tales (In fairy tales)
# Since my heart's been crushed (Since my heart's been crushed)
# Just don't believe in a tiny hell
# Don't know which way to turn (I don't know which way to turn)
# Figure it out for myself
# I've just started to learn (La da da dee oh)
# There's no such thing as fairy tales
# Twinkle twinkle little star
# Why do my dreams seem so far (Why they seem so far)
# Up above the world so high
# Won't somebody tell me why (Can you help me)
# Can you help me out
# Can you tell me what love is all about
# Cause I never known it for myself (Don't believe in fairy tales)
# That's why I don't believe in fairy tales no more
# Used to believe in love (No more)
# Used to believe in fairy tales (I used to believe, I used to believe, I used to believe)
# Since my heart's been crushed
# Just don't believe in a tiny hell (I don't believe in much)
# Don't know which way to turn
# Figure it out for myself (Oh no no no no no)
# I've just started to learn (Just started to learn)
# There's no such thing as fairy tales (There's no such thing as fairy tales)
# Used to believe in love
# Used to believe fairy tales (La da da da)
# Since my heart's been crushed
# Just don't believe in a tiny hell
# Don't know which way to turn (I don't know which way)
# Figure it out for myself
# I've just started to learn
# There's no such thing as fairy tales

# Straight from junior high school
# Then you messed it all up
# Started pushing up
# Kissed me on the cheek
# And I fell in love
# Shorty's a little taller now
# Into big things, he's a baller now
# His heart never changed
# I can see he's still down
# I can't forget him (No no no no)
# More than his voice is changing now
# All that I see is rearranging now (Now)
# It just ain't the same
# Catchin feelings now
# I should tell him (Yea)
# You knew you were the boy next door (Next door)
# Don't want to be my homeboy no more
# Saw something that I never saw before

# All that I see is rearranging now
# It just ain't the same
# Catchin feelings now

# All I want is what your giving
# Nothing like your affection
# So in love and you're the reason
# There's no more lonely season
# Make me love you, drive me crazy

# I don't really care
# But it's not for you
# And I aint got nothin' to prove
# There cant be any us, if there can't be any trust

# You might take me shopping, but I'm not your property
# If I dont like it, I decided
# I can make it on my own
# As long as we disagree to agree
# Down for you and you're down for me

# [VERSE 1:]
# I don't know what it is that you've done to me
# But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
# Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
# It's a feeling that I want to stay
# 'Cuz my heart starts beating triple time
# With thoughts of lovin' you on my mind
# I can't figure out just what to do
# When the cause and cure is you, you
# I get so weak in the knees
# I can hardly speak, I lose all control
# Then somethin' takes over me
# In a daze, your love's so amazing
# It's not a phase
# I want you to stay with me, by my side
# I swallow my pride
# Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off of my feet
# Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak
# [VERSE 2:]
# Time after time after time I've tried to fight it
# But your love is strong, it keeps on holdin' on
# Resistance is down when you're around, pride's fading
# In my condition I don't want to be alone
# 'Cuz my heart starts beating triple time
# With thoughts of lovin' you on my mind
# I can't figure out just what to do
# When the cause and cure is you, you
# I've tried hard to fight it
# No way can I deny it
# Your love's so sweet
# It knocks me off my feet
# [BRIDGE 2:]
# I get so weak
# Blood starts racing through my veins
# I get so weak
# Boy it's somethin' I can't explain
# I get so weak
# Somethin' 'bout the way you do the things you're do-oo-oo-in'
# Knocks me right off of my feet (off my feet)
# Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak (I get so)

# I'm feeling like I've become a better man

# I'm putting back the pieces others stole
# And now nobody can hurt
# My baby cause we make it work
# I can't hold the rain back when it starts to storms

# Kinda like the night when everythings alright
# Red and blue sparkling light disco balls spinning round we rollin' tight
# And everything that you do makes me want to ride

# These days I don't know what to do with myself
# I ain't even concerned about my health
# And I can't even seem to eat
# I haven't got a good sleep since the other day
# When you went away
# These times hurt my soul so bad
# Cause you can't seem to let yourself just bounce back
# We think too much about the things we said in the past
# When we both wasn't thinkin'
# And the words came out too fast
# If it isn't what you want then
# Tell me girl
# (My angel why do we fight so much)
# If you can't decide right now
# Do you need some time
# (Do you miss the way we used to kiss
# The way we used to touch)
# All we do is live in limbo
# In and out
# (Lately I just don't know)
# If this isn't what you want then
# Tell me girl
# Baby please don't hang up I really need you
# But I can't be your man if you cut me down
# If you say I'm just a fool
# Am I suppose to stick around
# And I know I also say hurtful things
# Like I don't want you no more
# But the truth is I don't know where to go if I walk through that door
# And this time
# It hurt my soul so bad
# Cause I can't let myself just bounce right back
# We think way too much 'bout them times in the past
# Now I don't know why we can't make the good times last
# I learn too much about the way I feel
# When you're gone away
# And I can't see you
# (Ooh you're all I really want)
# But I don't want to fight no more
# If it isn't what you want then
# Tell me girl
# (My angel why do we fight so much)
# If you can't decide right now
# Do you need some time
# (Do you miss the way we used to kiss
# The way we used to touch)
# Lately all we do is live in limbo
# In and out
# (Lately I just don't know)
# If this isn't what you want then
# Tell me girl
# If it isn't what you want then
# Tell me girl
# (My angel why do we fight so much)
# If you can't decide right now
# Do you need some time
# (Do you miss the way we used to kiss
# The way we used to touch)
# Lately all we do is live in limbo
# In and out
# (Lately I just don't know)
# If this isn't what you want then
# Tell me girl
# Spoken
# I know we said a lot of things we didn't mean
# But I need you to tell me
# What you want
# If this isn't what you want girl
# If it's not what you want
# Ain't no, ain't no reason to bother yourself baby

# Your phone is ringing, I don't want to ask
# If you go now, I'll understand
# If you stay here, I've got a plan
# You want to make a memory

# Are you dead to the world?
# It appears that you might be
# A little dead to the world
# Or at least a bit to all of those
# Who have shown a true affection
# You make a mess of those
# Who will care without exception
# As you pile drive through anything that stands
# In your way or blocks your view
# Are you dead to the world?
# I've gotta wonder if you are
# A little dead to the world
# With a reflex that is uncontrolled
# It's the only explanation
# Unless you're just as cold
# As they say and just as calculating
# Using and debilitating those
# Who can see the good in you
# Lost sight of it
# I made light of it
# Everyone makes mistakes
# We fell by the wayside
# We fell out of place
# I wish I could say that we'd fallen from grace
# But we never made it to that place

# Her ghost is six or so feet tall
# And the lights in the house are dim
# His voice still echoes through the hall
# She can't get away from him
# I clear the couch off and I sit
# She hangs up the phone and then
# She says she can't believe he quit
# But I know he'll be back again
# Every hour on the hour
# He will reappear and make it clear that he's around
# It's not your average social call
# He does it all without a sound
# Her ghost is propped up in the hall
# He speaks no evil there
# He doesn't notice me at all
# I find it a bit unfair
# I'm bathed in shadow from that wall
# I know he'll be in the air
# Every hour on the hour
# She'll watch her apparition stare her down, but pass her by
# And I've no ammunition
# I'm the one who's being exorcised
# Every hour on the hour
# Every moment all my power
# And every where I turn
# I tend to learn that she's got
# Mmories that never burn
# And this is of concern and I prepare to go
# 'Cause this I know that
# Though he's out of sight
# He's in her mind and in my hair
# I'm tiring of this fight
# Besides it's getting me nowhere
# Her ghost makes all of this occur
# He does it breathlessly
# So long as he's the life in her
# He'll be the death of me

# You've gotta know that there's more to this world
# Than what you have seen
# Cause we all have a limited view

# As we move along
# With our blinders on
# Each one of us feels a little stranded
# You can't explain or understand it
# Each one of us on a different planet
# And amidst all the
# to and fro
# Someone can say
# Hello
# Here we go
# Feeling that someone really gets you
# Well, its something that no one should object to

# I'll admit that hasn't happened yet
# I believe she's lying
# I trust her to undermine my faith in her, in time
# I have every confidence that she'll dismantle mine
# Given time
# As sure as she is sitting here
# She's sure that she's awake
# And as soon as we're committing
# We're admitting our mistake
# So of course it's only fitting

# Is drawn and whereupon I'm slamming on the brakes

# I trust her to undermine my faith in her, in time

# I'll be out on the town

# So here goes nothing
# Got away with so much
# I got by on so little
# Now I'm way out of touch
# With at faith that's too brittle
# And I'm doing the same things
# Its hypocritical don't remind me
# Cause when I doing the same things
# Several things will blind me

# Oh yeah - Oh Yeah
# Well theres always someone you cannot replace
# But you're hiding something deeper you can't face
# As you wonder 'round just feeling out of place

# Oh it's always something
# So here goes nothing
# And now I'm doing the same things
# Though it's never a noble mision
# It's an indication of bad things
# And my sad condition
# Same things
# Running around wouldn't that be something

# If I never knew you, if I never felt this love
# I would have no inkling of how precious life can be
# And if I never held you, I would never have a clue
# How at last I'd find in you the missing part of me
# In this world so full of fear, full of rage and lies
# I can see the truth so clear in your eyes, so dry your eyes
# And I'm so grateful to you, I'd have lived my whole life through
# Lost forever if I never knew you
# If I never knew you I'd be safe, but half as real
# Never knowing I could feel a love so strong and true
# I'm so grateful to you, I'd have lived my whole life through
# Lost forever if I never knew you
# I thought our love would be so beautiful
# Somehow we made the whole world bright
# I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong
# All they'd leave us were these whispers in the night
# But still my heart is singing we were right
# If I never knew you
# There's no moment I regret
# If I never knew the love
# Since the moment that we met
# I would have no inkling of
# If our time has gone too fast
# How precious life can be
# I've lived at last
# I thought our love would be so beautiful
# Somehow we'd make the whole world bright
# I thought our love would be so beautiful
# We'd turn the darkness into light
# And still my heart is singing we were right
# We were right
# And If I never knew you, if I never knew you
# I'd have lived my whole life through
# Empty as the sky
# Never knowing why, lost forever
# If I never knew you

# Isn't it strange
# Ain't it a shame
# People walking down broadway
# Begging for change
# We just walk by
# Don't hear that they're crying
# We just keep on typing on our two ways
# Oblivious to other people's pain
# Gotta open up our eyes
# Gotta read between the lines
# Gotta listen to the sound
# Cuz this is life
# It's harder than it looks
# You never get enough
# The time
# Keeps flying
# In life
# You only get one shot
# So give thanks for what you've got right now
# Don't you worry
# Hey we're gonna be alright
# we're gonna be alright
# Gonna be alright yea
# Woo
# Hey hey hey
# You feel so alone
# Your problems at home
# They always seem to follow you wherever you go
# Caught in a daze
# You wish you could change
# But you always tell yourself
# That hopes seems a million miles aways
# Gotta wake up from your sleep
# Gotta stay awake to dream
# Gotta open your heart and believe
# Oh
# Cuz this is life
# It's harder than it looks
# You never get enough
# The time
# Keeps flying
# In life
# You only get one shot
# So give thanks for what you've got right now
# Don't you worry
# Hey we're gonna be alright
# Hey we're gonna be alright
# Gonna be alright yea
# Hey hey hey
# One two three yea
# It's a roller coaster life
# Up and down and side to side
# Just shout to get it right
# Cuz this is life
# It's harder than it looks
# You never get enough
# The time
# Keeps flying
# In life you only get one shot
# So gives thanks for what you've got right now

# Think about it,
# There must be higher love.
# Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above.
# Without it,
# Life is wasted time.
# Look inside you're heart and I'll look in mine.
# Things look so bad everywhere.
# In this whole world what is fair?
# We walk the line and we try to see.
# Fallen behind what could be?
# Bring me a higher love.
# Bring me a higher love.
# Bring me a higher love.
# Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?
# The worlds turning,
# And we're just hanging on.
# Facing out fear,
# Standing out there alone.
# Yearning, and its real to me.
# Must be someone
# Who's feeling for me.
# Things look so bad everywhere.
# In this whole world what is fair?
# We walk the line and we try to see.
# Fallen behind what could be?
# Bring me a higher love.
# Bring me a higher love.
# Bring me a higher love.
# I've got higher love, higher love.
# I will wait, forever.
# I'm not too late for bed.
# Until then I'll sing my song.
# To spend the night alone.
# Bring me a higher love.
# Bring me a higher love.
# Bring me a higher love.
# Where's that higher love I've been thinking of?
# Bring me a higher love.
# Bring me a higher love.
# Bring me a higher love.
# Where's that higher love I keep thinking of.
# Bring me a higher love. (Bring me a higher love)
# Bring me a higher love. (Whoo!)

# Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
# And a Flux Capacitor
# He told me he built a time machine
# Like the one in the film I've seen
# Yeah.. he said
# I've been to the year 3000
# Not much has changed but they lived underwater
# And your great-great-great grandaughter
# Is doing fine (doing fine)
# He took me to the future in the Flux thing
# And I saw everything
# Boy bands, and another one, and another

# All the traffic lights are red
# The pain in your head says go back to bed
# Through the window everything seems right
# That's a life on the other side
# Hope you get there just in time
# While the world goes
# Round and round and round and round

# Round and round and round and round
# You're not alone we're all together
# Night and day, sunshine and rain
# Life was always meant to be that way
# 'Cos it's just another day
# When you just don't know what to do
# It's question two and you haven't got a clue
# You're just waiting for the bell to ring
# Or at least something to stop this happening
# Through the window everything seems right
# That's a life on the other side
# Find the answers just in time

# Willy is my child, he is my father
# I would be his lady all my life
# He says he'd love to live with me
# But for an ancient injury
# That has not healed
# He said I feel once again
# Like I gave my heart too soon
# He stood looking thru the lace
# At the face on the conquered moon
# And counting all the cars going up the hill
# And the stars on my window sill
# There are still more reasons why I love him
# Willy is my joy, he is my sorrow
# Now he wants to run away and hide
# He says our love cannot be real
# He cannot hear the chapel's pealing silver bells
# But you know it's hard to tell
# When you're in the spell if it's wrong or if it's real
# But you're bound to lose
# If you let the blues get you scared to feel
# And I feel like I'm just being born
# Like a shiny light breaking in a storm
# There are so many reasons why I love him.

# Ah, and he coughed as he cleared his throat
# He said come on you dirty heck into that district court
# Into the courtroom my trial began

# Johnny Henry's pappy woke him up one midnight
# He said "Before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you," Said "Listen boy
# Learn to hoist a jack and learn to lay a track learn to pick and shovel too
# And take that hammer, It'll do anything you tell it to."
# John Henry's mammy had about a dozen babies
# John Henry's pappy broke jail about a dozen times
# The babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money
# He said, "I'll pay you a quarter at a time startin' tomorrow
# that's the pay for a steel driver on this line."
# Then the section foreman said, "Hey! Hammer-swinger!
# I see you your own hammer boy but, what all can them muscles do?" and he said,
# "I can turn a jack I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too."
# "Can you swing a hammer, boy?" "Yes sir, I'll do anything you hire me to."
# Spoken:
# "Now ain't you somethin'! So high and mighty with all that muscle! Just go
# ahead, boy. Pick up that hammer, pick up the hammer!"
# He said to get a rusted spike and swing it down three times
# I'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to
# Go on and do what you say you can do
# With a steel-nosed hammer on a four foot switch handle
# John Henry raised it back til' it touched his heels then
# The spike went through the cross-tie and split it half in two
# Thirty-five cents a day for drivin' steel
# "Sweat! Sweat, boy! Sweat! Only two more swings!"
# "I was born drivin' steel"
# Well John Henry hammered in the mountain
# He'd give a grunt he give a groan every swing
# The women-folks from miles around heard him and come down
# To watch make the coal-steel ring "Lord! What a swinger!
# Watch him make the coal-steel ring"
# But the bad boys came up laughin' at John Henry
# They said," Your full of vinegar now but you bout' through!
# We gonna get a steamdrill to do your share of drivin'
# Then what's all them muscles gonna do? Huh? John Henry?
# Gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you."
# John Henry said,"I feed for little brothers
# and baby sisters' walkin' on her knees
# Now did the Lord say that machines ought to take place of livin'?
# And what's a substitute for bread and beans? I ain't seen it!
# Do engines get rewarded for their steam?
# John Henry hid in a coal mine for his dinner nap
# Had thirty minutes to rest before the bell
# The mine boys hollered," Get up whoever you are and get a pickax
# Mine me enough to start another hell and keep it burnin'
# Mine me enough to start another hell.
# John Henry said to his captain said "A man ain't nothin' but a man
# but if you'll bring that steamdrill 'round I'll beat it fair and honest.
# I'll die with that hammer in my hand but, I'll be laughin',
# cause you can't replace a steel-drivin' man.
# There was a big crowd of people at the mountain.
# John Henry said to the steam-drill "How is you?
# (spoken) Pardon me, Mister Steamdrill I suppose you didn't hear me. Huh?
# Well, can you turn a jack? Can you lay a track? Can you pick and shovel too?
# Listen, this hammer-swinger's talkin' to you.
# (Faster...........)
# Two-thousand people hollered, "Go John Henry!!!!!"
# Then somebody hollered," The mountain's cavin' in!!!!!!"
# John Henry told the captin,"Tell the kind-folks not to worry
# It ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind, it keeps me breathin'
# This steel-driver's muscle it ain't thin.
# "Captain tell the people to move back farther
# I'm at the finish line and there ain't no drill
# It's so far behind that it don't got the brains to quit it
# When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills Lord, Lord

# Well, John Henry had a little woman
# I believe the lady's name was Paulie Ann yeah that was his good woman
# John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home
# He laid down to rest his weary back and early next mornin' he said,
# "Come here Paulie Ann, come here sugar.
# You know I believe this is the first time there ever was the sun come
# and I couldn't come up. Take my hammer, Paulie Ann and go to that railroad
# Swing that hammer like you seen me do it

# Tell em'.........
# I can hoist a jack and I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too.
# Ain't no machine can that's been proved to you!
# There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house

# Trains go by on the rails John Henry laid.
# They slow down and take off the hats, the men do

# MISSING YOUR LOVE - JONNY LANG
# You lay me down
# Whisper in my ear
# Well it may be my name you call
# But it's his name I hear
# And you promise me
# Through thick and thin, Baby
# Well you told me you love me
# You told me a lie
# Cause you love him
# And I'm missing your love
# Every day
# I'm missing your love
# Every way
# Though you're here with me
# I'm still missing your love, Baby
# And when we talk
# You look into my eyes
# Well you're talkin to me
# But Baby I can see
# He's on your mind
# And I'm missing your love
# Every day
# I'm missing your love
# Every way
# Though you're here with me
# Baby, I'm missing your love
# Oh and I
# I reach out for you
# And you turn away

# Every now and then
# We find a special friend
# Who never lets us down
# Who understands it all
# Reaches out each time you fall
# You're the best friend that I've found
# I know you can't stay
# A part of you will never ever go away
# Your heart will stay
# I'll make a wish for you
# And hope it will come true
# That life would just be kind
# To such a gentle mind
# If you lose your way
# Think back on yesterday
# Remember me this way
# Remember me this way
# I don't need eyes to see
# The love you bring to me
# No matter where I go
# And I know that you'll be there
# Forever more a part of me, you're everywhere
# I'll always care
# I'll make a wish for you
# And hope it will come true
# That life would just be kind
# To such a gentle mind
# If you lose your way

# Remember me this way
# Remember me this way
# And I'll be right behind your shoulder watching you
# I'll be standing by your side and all you do
# And I won't ever leave
# As long as you believe
# You just believe

# Oh, oh yeah, oh, oh God, hey
# I don't know
# The way that you want this to go
# Baby I'm so sick and tired of playing your games
# If you say the word
# I'll be there soon as it's heard
# Maybe I'm wasting my time working on you
# 1 - I'll do my best to show you
# That I'm the one to hold you
# Sometimes you make me lose my mind
# 2 - We can all go to a different party
# Dancing in the streets with some girls from Maui
# We can all rock at the Déjà Vu
# And you know how we do it
# I just want you to start shaking your body
# Times are gonna change
# Girl you know I'm naughty
# I know you know
# I'll go solo
# With so many lovers, so many offers
# To be all over, you ain't part of me
# You won't believe
# All of the tricks up my sleeve
# Baby you so hypnotize me with your eyes
# I can't control
# Long enough to let you know
# I'm getting old
# Wasting my time waiting on you
# Repeat 1
# Repeat 2
# 3 - It's a different party, party
# Gotta shake your body, body
# It's a different party, party
# Cause you know I'm naughty
# It's a different party, party
# So shake your body, body
# It's a different party, party
# And that's how we do it, do it
# Jimmy Jam!
# Gotta get you in the groove girl
# Gotta get you in the mood
# Up now, now down
# Gotta get up, get up, get down
# Gotta get you in the groove girl
# Gotta get you in the mood
# Up now, now down
# Spinning around and around until we hit the ground
# Repeat 2 (2x)

# I've seen the crystal ball
# And I got a lot to mend
# I drank a thousand nights
# I had a million friends
# I watched the world go round
# At speeding light and then
# Sometimes she walks the hall
# I hope it never ends
# Chorus:
# No other woman gets to me the way you do
# Baby I would change my ways
# If I could be with you
# Make me your lover
# I'll make your dreams come true
# Baby I would change my ways
# If I could be with you
# Sometimes it takes a light
# To see the room you're in
# You got it all around
# You recognize the sun
# I don't wanna use the sun
# To melt away my blues
# I need you to keep me warm
# And give me something true
# Chorus
# I've seen the crystal ball
# And I got a lot to mend
# Do you save a helpless flame
# Or rather watch it burn
# I need to read from you
# 'Cause I gotta lot to learn

# Thanks to    I feel like the world is on my head
# I dont wanna lose what made me a man
# Still when I call your name
# I wait, you'll say, you're so far away
# Now that I feel the well so dry
# I need you to fill me up inside
# Baby you turn me on and on
# Just wanna hold you
# I'm dying to show you
# Don't run from me
# Don't turn your back on me
# We're getting closer
# Don't say that it's over
# Don't run from me
# Don't turn your back on me
# Come out of the dark
# Don't tear us apart
# Don't run from my heart
# It took me some time to understand
# What all along I held in my hands
# If you give me one more chance
# I'll prove, I'm true, to you
# Now every night it seems so wrong
# I'm here all alone where you belong
# Girl let me turn you on and on
# I'm such a dreamer
# When I'm sleeping, I'm thinking of you
# A million roses, waterfalls, around a bed for two
# Sippin' fruits with the best babe
# I'm not here for the rest babe
# Need your candlelight, sweet love tonight
# I can't afford to lose you

# A loss that would have thrown
# A hole through anybody's soul
# And you were only human after all
# So don't hold back the tears my dear
# Release them so your eyes can clear
# I know that you will rise again
# But you gotta let them fall
# I wish that I could snap my fingers
# Erase the past but no
# You cannot rewind reality
# Once the tape's unrolled
# [Chorus:]
# If your spirit's broken and you can't bear the pain
# I will help you put the pieces back
# A little more each day
# And if your heart is locked and you can't find the key
# Lay your head upon my shoulder
# I'll set you free
# I'll be your security
# A moment of despair
# That forces you to say that life's unfair
# It makes you scared of what tomorrow may bring
# But don't go giving into fear
# Stop hiding all alone in there
# The show keeps going on and on
# But you'll miss the whole damn thing
# I wish I had a crystal ball to see what the future holds
# But we don't know how the story ends till it's all been told
# [Chorus]
# On any clock upon the wall
# The time is always now
# So baby kiss the past goodbye
# Don't let the future blow your mind
# Just sit back and chill
# Take things as they come
# You can't be afraid
# To live for today
# I will be with you each step of the way

# You gotta give me all of you
# Not asking too much of a heart that's true

# What's the name of the game that we are playing
# But whenever I think that we are winning
# Then you roll the dice take a slide
# Right back to the one from 99
# Is it gonna go on like this forever
# Are we gonna to take that last step together
# Going round and round and up and down
# Feels just like snakes and ladders
# Baby don't it feel like a carousel
# Where all the world is rushing by
# But when it stops you realize
# That you're right back where you started at
# I need a little more than that
# It time for us to face the facts
# Whether to be or not to be
# That is the question so it seems
# We're going nowhere in between
# So tell me...

# Don't wanna play this game no more

# You're sniffing on snow when you're feeling low
# Suffocating dreams that could have been
# Maybe for a minute I was down with that
# But it didn't take long for me to see the light
# You swore you had control of it
# But when I stepped back you slipped on your supply
# [Chorus]
# Taking it back I'm taking it back
# Taking back my life
# Taking it back I'm taking it back
# Taking back my life
# Ain't nobody got no business stressing all the time
# Taking it back I'm taking it back
# Taking back my life
# [Chorus]
# Taking it back I'm taking it back
# Taking back my life
# Taking it back I'm taking it back
# Taking back my life
# Ain't nobody got no business stressing all the time

# You're wasting your time
# Trying to tear us apart
# You can't stop our plans
# We were destined from the start
# He loves me
# I love him
# And even though were young at heart
# You're the one in denial
# Tired of creeping around when I'm craving for
# His kiss
# Whenever I'm lonely he is the only one
# I miss
# You say it ain't right but I think that you got it wrong
# Its bliss
# And I love him yeah yeah
# I love him
# He makes me go oo-oo-ooooo
# When he looks at me
# Oo-ooo-ooo
# And it's plain to see
# Nothing you can do-oo-ooooo
# To discourage me
# And I love him
# I really love him
# [Chorus]
# My parents say I'm too good and that he doesn't deserve me
# My friends think he's not cool enough so they'd rather desert me
# My sister says her boyfriend has a brother and she'll introduce me
# But I don't want him, no
# I've got my man
# There's nothing you can do-oo-oooo
# To discourage me
# I'm cool with my man's family
# If you were in my shoes
# You'd feel differently
# But you're in denial

# You're the one in denial
# You're the one, you're the one

# Said I would cry for him

# Hell I'd even die for him

# She took the midnight train goin' anywhere...
# Just a city boy born and raised in South Detroit
# He took the midnight train goin' anywhere....
# A singer in a smoky room
# The smell of wine and cheap perfume
# For a smile they can share the night
# It goes on and on and on and on...
# Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
# Their shadows searching in the night
# Streetlight people living just to find emotion
# Hiding somewhere in the night
# Working hard to get my fill,
# everybody wants a thrill
# Payin' anything to roll the dice
# Just one more time
# Some will win, some will lose
# Some were born to sing the blues
# Oh, the movie never ends

No, per Baglioni e giù a ricordarsi 2000 canzoni canzoni che abbiamo ascoltato e ballato quel palco che sogno da quando son nato i pezzi legati ai cantanti e ai loro miti alcuni più vivi che mai, altri finiti ma sempre rimane l'affetto per quella voce che in giorni di buio mi accendeva una luce è sempre la stessa canzone che cambia (ripetuto) è sempre la stessa canzone che cambia la faccia e quella più bella non è detto mica che piaccia la MUSICA, MUSICA, MUSICA apre le porte e fa diventare ogni giorno la vita più forte e come una penna che ti sottolinea le cose che quelle più ricche alla fine non sono costose io che alla musica un po' mi ci sono sposato sorrido perch? ancora ei non mi ha abbandonato

# Ho una promessa di ali
# scritta sulla mia schiena
# qualcosa di me
# un giorno volerà
# sono la punta dell'iceberg
# l'anello di una catena
# qualcosa di me
# nel vento resterà
# il meccanismo complesso delle ossa della mia mano
# è precedente alla mia volontà
# gli atomi del mio cuore vengono da molto lontano
# da molto prima della felicità
# colori dentro al mio occhio
# e suoni dentro al mio orecchio
# brrrivi reaggenti chimici
# tento di fare amicizia
# con quello dentro allo specchio
# che dice scusami perchè mi imiti
# sono un'incrocio di linee
# sono l'altare del caso
# i miei pensieri si accendono con l'aria nel naso
# se la mia vita è una gabbia allora sono un'evaso
# io credo a tutto mi chiamo mica tommaso
# trasformo zucchero in sogni e pesci in passi di danza
# ed ho inventato il lavoro per poter fare vacanza
# e mi innamoro di tutto e non mi stanco mai
# di provocare amore di provocare guai
# gira il minestrone che sennò s'attacca
# bagna questa pianta che sennò si secca

# la tecnica la matematica
# ma è il bisogno di uscire da questo corpo persona
# è precedente alla cybernetica
# e posso unirmi a una donna e seminare il suo campo
# ma non so fare la pioggia e non so fare il lampo
# il mio destino proforma ed il mio corpo si forma nei secoli dei secoli
# il ritmo di quattro quarti è quello più congeniale
# perchè fa rima con il respiro del cuore
# lo stretto di gibilterra è la mia zona ideale perchè fa rima
# col mio bisogno di andare

# sono il discjockey dei venti so fabbricare il sudore
# ma non son buono a remixare l'amore
# e sono un giglio dei campi sono ubbriaco di brina
# e in ogni notte vado a cercare la mattina
# con 20 segni io posso spiegare quello che provo
# ma non so chi è nato prima la gallina o l'uovo
# io sono un vecchio bambino compratemi un pallocino

# e più ne dai e più ti vien voglia di darne

# Questo, quello che dichiaro in questo testo mi rappresenta ma voglio essere onesto la confusione non si risolve con la canzone, ma per lo meno ci fa passare un po' di tempo in piedi ballare può servire se ci credi sarà il più primitivo dei rimedi la danza della pioggia degli indiani danze tribali come gli africani un filo che ci lega ai cantastorie per non dimenticare le memorie aggiungeremo al media che ci investe le nostre teste le nostre teste saremo un arcipelago di idee, resisteremo a piogge e maree riprodurremo il fuoco sull'asfalto potrà sembrare un urlo e qualche salto ma è sangue corpo anima e intelletto un suono primitivo e benedetto irrompe nelle strade e nelle radio nelle tivù nelle scuole allo stadio l'esercito sarà degli insicuri cuori confusi e sguardi da duri, lo scriverò a graffiti sui muri perch? la mente non si riposa... DOBBIAMO INVENTARCI QUALCOSA dobbiamo inventarci qualcosa perch? così non si può andare avanti c'è troppa distanza tra noi, e siamo troppo distanti succede che il non conoscersi spesso genera la paura e spinge all'isolamento tra le solite quattro mura ma facendo i conti con il disordine spesso si ottiene la soluzione le dissonanze che si organizzano fanno nascere una canzone io di vita conosco soltanto la mia le altre le vedo passare le leggo attraverso la mia verità per questo non so giudicare so solo che quando la strada finisce c'è un bivio dentro al tuo cuore e se decidi di andare avanti devi fare l'esploratore e il fatto di non sapere assolutamente dove va il mondo mi spinge a guardarmi dentro cercando di andare sempre più a fondo cercando attraverso un viaggio di conoscenza di ciò che sono di fare qualcosa di buono, di fare qualcosa di buono "divide et impera", chi l'ha detto ha interpretato la nostra storia ci han regalato un viaggio nel futuro in cambio della nostra memoria ma dobbiamo inventarci qualcosa, in senso stretto stretto ed in senso lato dobbiamo...visto che tutto quanto è stato già inventato dovremmo servirci forse di quello che la natura crea ci vuole una grande idea questo sound mi fa venire in mente di come io stavo quando ero ancora nella pancia di mia madre e stavo già ballando protetto da quell'involucro dove non mi mancava niente ricercare quell'atmosfera stasera può essere divertente ritrovo il mio cordone ombelicale risalgo fino al brodo primordiale di lì ricostruisco la mia storia per non dimenticare la memoria la musica mi aiuterà a parlare a comunicare perch? la mente non si riposa DOBBIAMO INVENTARCI QUALCOSA

# con la faccia in su e il cuore sbrindellato
# con l'alba dentro e il sole incorporato

# che non desidera non è desiderato
# è sempre puntuale
# come il telegiornale
# parasimpatico è come un animale
# leggero leggero
# sincero sincero
# dimmi dove sei fammi vedere le mani
# funky beat è il suono beato
# senza futuro senza passato
# è ora solamente ora come un gelato
# come un innamorato
# come l'azione
# come passione
# funky beat
# c'era una volta un corpo senza capo n? coda
# senza trucco n? scarpe n? vestiti alla moda
# un corpo nudo e crudo come quello di Adamo e di Eva
# niente credeva niente sapeva
# un giorno sentì uscire dalla radio un rumore
# sotto forma di un suono da un forte calore
# senza capo ne coda proprio come era lui
# come un fascio di luce negli angoli bui
# della stanza
# una specie di sacra antichissima danza
# il ricordo di lui gli riempì l'atmosfera
# fu in quel momento che seppe
# davvero chi era
# si sentiva beat-o
# per essere nato
# quel suono era suo l'aveva ritrovato
# sono qua si va potremmo andare avanti così per una settimana
# senza cambiare accordo ne tempo come un film senza trama
# un eterno finale
# che non si sa se finisce bene o se finisce male
# e nell'attesa restare a mezz'aria beati
# come appena nati
# come meravigliati
# come maghi e come innamorati come innamorati
# sono qua si va funky beat che cazzo ci vuoi fare
# non è questione di bene o di male
# non è questione di buono o cattivo
# è questione di essere vivo
# di essere adesso di scoprire il presente
# di non farsi manipolare da ciò che pensa o che dice la gente
# di essere ora di essere e basta
# cattolico ebreo mussulmano agnostico o rasta
# è il funky beat non conta mica un cazzo dove sei nato
# se sei un fighetto con il culo parato
# oppure un inquieto
# oppure un arrabbiato
# è troppo comodo dividere ciò che sembra unito
# bisognerebbe unire ciò che invece è diviso
# e questo vale in ogni scala dal macroscopico al microscopico
# mi sembra logico

# La notte è più bello, si vive meglio,
# per chi fino alle 5 non conosce sbadiglio,
# e la città riprende fiato e sembra che dorma,
# e il buio la trasforma e le cambia forma
# e tutto è più tranquillo tutto è vicino
# e non esiste traffico e non c'è casino
# almeno quello brutto, quello che stressa,
# la gente della notte sempre la stessa
# ci si conosce tutti come in un paese,
# sempre le stesse facce mese dopo mese
# e il giorno cambia leggi e cambia governi
# e passano le estati e passano gli inverni,
# la gente della notte sopravvive sempre
# nascosta nei locali confusa tra le ombre.
# La gente della notte fa lavori strani,
# certi nascono oggi e finiscono domani,
# baristi, spacciatori, puttane e giornalai,
# poliziotti, travestiti gente in cerca di guai,
# padroni di locali, spogliarelliste, camionisti,
# metronotte, ladri e giornalisti,
# fornai e pasticceri, fotomodelle,
# di notte le ragazze sembrano tutte belle,
# e a volte becchi una, in discoteca,
# la rivedi la mattina e ti sembra una strega,
# la notte fa il suo gioco e serve anche a quello
# a far sembrare tutto, tutto un po' più bello.
# Parlare in una macchina davanti a un portone
# ed alle quattro e mezzo fare colazione
# con i cornetti caldi e il caffelatte
# e quando sorge il sole dire buonanotte
# e leggere il giornale prima di tutti,
# sapere in anteprima tutti i fatti belli e brutti,
# di notte le parole scorrono più lente
# però è molto più facile parlare con la gente,
# conoscere le storie, ognuna originale,
# sapere che nel mondo nessuno è normale.
# Ognuno avrà qualcosa che ti potrà insegnare,
# gente molto diversa di ogni colore.
# A me piace la notte gli voglio bene
# che vedo tante albe e pochissime mattine,
# la notte mi ha adottato e mi ha dato un lavoro
# che mi piace un sacco anzi io l'adoro.

Pannella che mi sembra una persona intelligente anche lui con le parole sa convincere la gente ma però poi si sputtana quando è alle conclusioni e io che torno ad ascoltare delle belle canzoni Ho perso la direzione... cerco di farmi un'idea ed ascolto i liberali che mi sembrano persone oneste e pure regolari poi mi accorgo che tra loro c'è Sgarbi Vittorio che vorrebbe esser presente anche a Montecitorio ma a me lui sta sul cazzo pur essendo intelligente e non credo che lui faccia del bene alla gente lui che parla parla e spara commenta e spara vedo un'ombra di violenza la sua faccia non è chiara Ho perso la direzione... questa Lega è una vergogna canta Pino Daniele eppure questa Lega viaggia a gonfie vele ma io credo che in Italia forse faccio un errore tra la gente e tra i ragazzi ci sia un filo conduttore non credo sia possibile riuscire a tagliare quindi la Lega non la riesco a votare come non voto per Moana e non perch? è una puttana ma perch? non penso sia un esempio di italiana le italiane amano il sesso ma a letto fan l'amore non lo fanno per i soldi lo fanno col cuore e poi ci sono le altre 1500 fazioni che partecipano ad accrescere le nostre tensioni e le mie idee confuse idee poco chiare che mi spingono a restare a casa invece di votare ma così farei lo sporco gioco di quegli stessi che si ingrassano alle spalle dell'Italia dei fessi Ho perso la direzione... certe volte alla TV, che so al telegiornale quando vedo quelle madri ve lo giuro sto male quelle storie di ragazzi morti in sale da gioco dove un soldo vale molto e una vita vale poco prego e penso ai miei amici ai miei fratelli e sorelle penso a quegli innamorati insieme sotto le stelle penso che se ami tua madre e non la puoi non amare questa violenza non la puoi accettare e di fronte a tutto questo un voto non vale niente ma è importante che impariamo a voler bene alla gente non importa sulla scheda io che cazzo ci metto è importante il rispetto il rispetto non importa sulla scheda io che cazzo ci scrivo è importante che ogni uomo abbia diritto ad esser vivo.

# Sono io, sono io, quello di E' QUI LA FESTA, quello con il cappellino quello senza la testa. Dovevate farmi fuori 6 anni fa se volevate la tranquillità e invece sono qui vivo e ancora parlante, questo è il nostro 5? album, non sono un cantante, faccio il rap, quella musica dura, quella senza melodia, quella che fa paura, paura, ma dove andremo a finire, ma guarda un po' cosa ci tocca sentire e intanto mentre sto parlando il rap è entrato in Italia, questo genere del quale io mi sento una balia, senza false modestie questo LP esce in un momento dove finalmente anche qui il rap ha assunto dimensioni oltre la curiosità e coinvolge gente di tutte le età. Finalmente si muove, finalmente una ventata di compagini nuove Il ragazzo con un giradischi e un campionatore, un cervello per pensare, organizza il rumore e ci dice sopra a tempo tutto quello che pensa, musica incazzata contro la violenza. RAP RAP Il rap, i nuovi cantautori, senza chitarre ma con tanti rumori e tante idee da dire più o meno intelligenti Chuck illumina le menti e fa che crescano i ragazzi aria di rinnovamento e grazie a questo asfalto un nuovo rinascimento come quello che ha ridato forza ai neri americani fa che succeda anche per quelli italiani, alla faccia di San Remo, delle televisioni, comunichiamoci le nostre emozioni. RAP IL RAP Sono io, sono io, a parlare di questo io che ho fatto sia San Remo che Fantastico e il resto, sono io, perch? ho un microfono potente e voglio dire ciò che penso alla gente e ai ragazzi che si perdono in mille confusioni comunichiamoci le nostre emozioni attraverso ogni canale usiamo questo linguaggio e cominciamo a darci qualche messaggio, la musica rinasce nelle strade tra i banchi il rap che parla ai neri, ai bianchi, io ci credo e tu lo sai, tu che storci il tuo naso ma son più saggio e non ci faccio caso RAP IL RAP Il rap per società multirazziali dove tutti nei diritti e nei doveri sono uguali, musica che nasce dalle ceneri del rock, della musica elettronica, ed è uno shock per molti una sirena su un disco, ma a me mi piace ed impazzisco per tutto ciò che mi stimola un po' non so domani che cosa ascolterò ma oggi la mia testa è aperta come non mai pronto a partire se tu mi seguirai impara le parole, inventane di nuove, incontra i tuoi amici e fate delle prove, la musica è la cosa più bella che c'è MUOVITI MUOVITI MUOVITI MAN MUOVITI MUOVITI MUOVITI MAN.

# Picchia duro sul tamburo vai sicuro suono puro
# io mi curo col tamburo e trasformo il mio futuro in un treno da ballare
# in un posto salutare picchia duro sul tamburo
# piano piano mi carburo è così che rompo il muro
# col mio suono di siluro contro il mondo e il suo cianuro
# ed il tempo io catturo succo di frutto maturo
# salto su come un canguro sgommo come con l'enduro
# chiudo gli occhi e nello scuro io mi lascio andare
# con le mani sul tamburo sudo tutto il mio cloruro
# nella danza mi avventuro la realtà io trasfiguro
# chiudo gli occhi per vedere l'universo respirare

# Sotto una palma al centro di Alexander Platz
# Ci siamo presi il nostro tempo per decidere
# Con la filosofia del grande Snaporaz
# Abbiamo scelto che non volevamo scendere
# Da questa giostra che ci fa girar la testa
# E che ci tiene in orbita
# Dentro a una giungla sopra a un tetto di Parigi
# Mentre ammiravo le tue ali di farfalla
# Abbiamo immaginato di essere felici
# Come due bimbi proprietari di una stella
# In una febbre tropicale al polo sud
# sognai i miei vecchi sorridenti in riva al mare
# Mentre guardavano la mia barca andare via
# Benedicendo la mia rotta dentro al cuore
# Perchè ogni tempo porta dentro un dispiacere
# Perchè ogni giorno porta dentro un pò d'amore
# Che ci tiene in orbita
# Dentro un locale messicano di Shanghai
# Ho immaginato meno spreco di dolore
# Ho vista appesa al muro l'onda di Hokusai
# Mi ha ricordato che ogni cosa può cambiare
# Su questa giostra che ci fa girar la testa
# E che ci tiene in orbita

# E fu così che una vacca sacra dell'India che non era mai stata nella Palestina passando di fronte a un ristorante italiano riconobbe da fuori la sua vecchia cugina che lavorava come bistecca alla fiorentina in un ristorante italiano in Palestina e le chiese la strada per andare a trovare dove la terra si incrocia col cielo e col mare qualcuno le disse viaggiare è importante ma il posto che cerchi non è molto distante da dove ti trovi e da dove stai andando unisciti a noi che ci stiamo arrivando e se nel cammino noi poi invecchieremo se su quella terra non ci arriveremo ci saranno degli altri poi altri poi ancora fin quando qualcuno nell'anno del dunque sarà in nessun posto e sarà pure ovunque

# La linea d'ombra la nebbia che io vedo a me davanti per la prima volta nella vita mia mi trovo a saper quello che lascio e a non saper immaginar quello che trovo mi offrono un incarico di responsabilità portare questa nave verso una rotta che nessuno sa è la mia età a mezz'aria in questa condizione di stabilità precaria ipnotizzato dalle pale di un ventilatore sul soffitto mi giro e mi rigiro sul mio letto mi muovo col passo pesante in questa stanza umida di un porto che non ricordo il nome il fondo del caffè confonde il dove e il come e per la prima volta so cos'è la nostalgia la commozione nel mio bagaglio panni sporchi di navigazione per ogni strappo un porto per ogni porto in testa una canzone è dolce stare in mare quando son gli altri a far la direzione senza preoccupazione soltanto fare ciò che c'è da fare e cullati dall'onda notturna sognare la mamma... il mare.
# Mi offrono un incarico di responsabilità mi hanno detto che una nave c'ha bisogno di un comandante mi hanno detto che la paga è interessante e che il carico è segreto ed importante il pensiero della responsabilità si è fatto grosso è come dover saltare al di là di un fosso che mi divide dai tempi spensierati di un passato che è passato saltare verso il tempo indefinito dell'essere adulto di fronte a me la nebbia mi nasconde la risposta alla mia paura cosa sarò dove mi condurrà la mia natura? La faccia di mio padre prende forma sullo specchio lui giovane io vecchio le sue parole che rimbombano dentro al mio orecchio "la vita non è facile ci vuole sacrificio un giorno te ne accorgerai e mi dirai se ho ragione" arriva il giorno in cui bisogna prendere una decisione e adesso è questo giorno di monsone col vento che non ha una direzione guardando il cielo un senso di oppressione ma è la mia età dove si sa come si era e non si sa dove si va, cosa si sarà che responsabilità si hanno nei confronti degli esseri umani che ti vivono accanto e attraverso questo vetro vedo il mondo come una scacchiera dove ogni mossa che io faccio può cambiare la partita intera ed ho paura di essere mangiato ed ho paura pure di mangiare mi perdo nelle letture, i libri dello zen ed il vangelo l'astrologia che mi racconta il cielo galleggio alla ricerca di un me stesso con il quale poter dialogare ma questa linea d'ombra non me la fa incontrare. Mi offrono un incarico di responsabilità non so cos'è il coraggio se prendere e mollare tutto se scegliere la fuga od affrontare questa realtà difficile da interpretare ma bella da esplorare provare a immaginare cosa sarò quando avrò attraversato il mare portato questo carico importante a destinazione dove sarò al riparo dal prossimo monsone mi offrono un incarico di responsabilità domani andrò giù al porto e gli dirò che sono pronto a partire getterò i bagagli in mare studierò le carte e aspetterò di sapere per dove si parte quando si parte e quando passerà il monsone dirò levate l'ancora diritta avanti tutta questa è la rotta questa è la direzione questa è la decisione.

# Proprio come un albero che vive in mezzo agli alberi mi sento quando giro per il mondo cerco di far si che il vento non mi butti giù e di affondar le mie radici nel profondo, prendo il sole in faccia per far si che le mie foglie stiano bene appiccicate lungo questi rami ospito tra le mie braccia nidi di uccellini e do rifugio nel mio fusto a molti sciami.
# Proprio come un albero mi spoglio e mi rivesto a seconda se c'è freddo o c'è calore dentro la genetica la mappa delle cellule descrive a quale genere appartengo se sono una quercia oppure un salice piangente oppure un baobab od un saggio di pianura quello che è importante è che al mondo ci sia spazio per qualsiasi espressione di natura.
# Prendo il sole in faccia bevo molta pioggia (2v) io non ho problemi a convivere con gli altri sono pronto ad accettare la mia sorte sono consapevole del fatto che più o meno presto o tardi ci sarà per me la morte quella che Totò ha definito la livella e che alla fine ci livella tutti uguali alberi bestiole re profeti presidenti calciatori poveretti ed animali.
# Quello che io penso come albero parlante è che la vita sia questione di radici più sono profonde più ti puoi portar lontano incontrando gente conquistando amici perch? io ho scoperto che le mie radici in fondo sono lì per procurarmi le risorse cosicch? con le mie foglie io possa affrontare venti forti e possa farmi delle corse.
# Prendo il sole in faccia bevo molta pioggia (4v)
# Andare di qua e di là sconfinare allegramente farmi un pò ogni tipo di esperienza incontrare gente allargare le vedute e allenare pure un po' l'intelligenza senza mai scordare cosa sono da dove vengo e pure dove voglio andare con le mie radici belle salde nel terreno io coi rami io mi posso allontanare perch? c'ho bisogno della terra sotto i piedi dove dare fondamenta alla speranza proprio come un albero mi adatto un poco a tutto basta solo un po' di clima di accoglienza no no no alla violenza non rivendico nessuna appartenenza tranne quella al mondo degli esseri viventi col diritto di affondare le radici sogno un universo dove ogni differenza sia la base per poter essere amici prendo il sole in faccia bevo molta pioggia proprio come un albero mi colloco nel mezzo tra la terra e il cielo proprio a metà via opero una sintesi tra luce e clorofilla equilibrio di sostanza ed energia.

# Di sopra, di sotto, di lato, di fianco di ballare questo disco non mi stanco mai io non mi stanco mai, e non ti stancherai se tu mi seguirai "baby" il basso gira come una trottola fammi sentire che ti piace dimmi di sì (SI) bene bene mi piace, mi piace così senti questo ritmo che va LIBERA L'ANIMA OK OK dimmi che ci sei, fammi sentire che ti piace grida forte OK (OK) lasciati andare "baby" lasciati andare segui questo ritmo che sale lasciati andare segui questo ritmo che sale non ti devi impressionare se cominci a sudare farai meglio ad ascoltare e continuare a ballare la carica ti arriva attraverso le casse passa nelle tue gambe e nelle zone più basse poi raggiunge le braccia che si muovono in alto e la carica passa attraverso le mani di un altro l'energia si propaga con le onde sonore ti colpisce le orecchie poi ti passa nel cuore senti come va, senti senti senti come va senti come va, senti senti senti come va LIBERA L'ANIMA, LIBERA L'ANIMA tutta la droga del mondo non vale un grammo della mia adrenalina LIBERA L'ANIMA, LIBERA L'ANIMA non è mai troppo tardi e non è mai troppo presto per fare quello che ho chiesto per fare quello che ho chiesto LIBERA L'ANIMA LIBERA L'ANIMA LIBERA L'ANIMA LIBERA L'ANIMA

# Luna di città d'agosto che sembri solamente mia
# in questo asfalto posto con la gente che se n'è andata via
# luna di città d'agosto mi piace guardarti la schiena
# mentre sei girata verso il mare in questa nottata serena
# va e dille che sto bene di non pensare a me
# di lasciar perdere il vento soffia e il tempo passerà
# palazzi e strade come scenografie di uno spettacolo che è andato male
# coi ballerini che tolgono il trucco per ritornare a cominciare a sognare
# luna di città d'agosto raccontami un'altra bugia
# fammi riscaldare davanti al fuoco caldo della malinconia
# va e dille che sto bene di non pensare a me
# di lasciar perdere il vento soffia e il tempo passerà...

# Mi ricordo da bambino che mio padre era spesso arrabbiato con me e non sapevo perch? ritornavo dalla scuola verso l'una e quaranta e la fame era tanta con mia madre che diceva che c'è? Lorenzo dimmi che c'è? come è andata come mai non mi dici mai niente? ma che razza di gente questi figli che ho certe volte non so cosa ho fatto per vedervi dire sempre di no non lo so, non lo so ma ti droghi? fai veder le braccia ma che razza di faccia non mi piace per niente quella razza di gente con la quale ti vedi ma che cosa ti credi che tuo padre ed io non ti vogliamo bene? sempre le stesse scene ogni giorno ogni sera quella stessa atmosfera. mentre mio padre mi vedeva crescere lui mi sembrava non potesse invecchiare mentre crescevo tre centimetri l'anno lui era sempre uguale Mi ricordo a dodici anni un pomeriggio di sole mi portò a un funerale ma era uno speciale che non c'era neanche un morto parente neanche un conoscente solo un sacco di gente seria molto composta una specie di festa al contrario e mio padre Mario mi diceva quando avrai un po' più anni potrai dire io c'ero ai funerali degli agenti della scorta di Moro questa sera quasi ventisette anni sto leggendo il giornale e di quel funerale mi risale l'immagine in mente e ho chiarissimo in testa quel concetto di festa al contrario e di mio padre Mario che per come era sempre severo mi appariva sincero nel dolore del restare impotente insieme a molta altra gente che sostava di fronte al potere di pochi sulla vita di molti e a quei volti sconvolti delle madri delle mogli dei parenti e dei figli degli agenti della scorta di Moro e mio padre Mario era così serio E mi teneva sulla testa una mano quel pomeriggio è lontano quasi venti anni fa i negozi che chiudevano in tutta la città ogni cosa era strana nella mia fantasia non capivo perch? in giro c'era tutta quella polizia le sirene spiegate le serrande abbassate sono più grande ma le cose non sono cambiate La mia mano è più grande e mio padre più anziano la mia mamma si preoccupa perch? sono lontano. Questa storia che ho detto con la rima baciata non so forse neanche io perch? ve l'ho raccontata forse il centro di tutto è quella mano che mio padre mi appoggiò sulla testa questo è quanto mi resta un ricordo profondo grande come il mondo questo gesto che mio padre ebbe il cuore di fare questo gesto d'amore mille volte più potente di un pugno in questa notte di giugno in cui scrivo mi fa essere vivo pronto ad essere padre a mia volta e a spiegare a mio figlio bambino come ogni destino si unisce si confonde e si intreccia in comune con le altre persone gli dirò che ogni schiaffo e ogni pugno che è dato ogni piccolo diritto che nel mondo è violato è una ferita per tutti gli esseri della terra e finch? non c'è giustizia ci sarà sempre guerra

# Caselli d'autostrada tutto il tempo si consuma
# Ma Venere riappare sempre fresca dalla schiuma
# La foto della scuola non mi assomiglia più
# Ma i miei difetti sono tutti intatti
# E ogni cicatrice è un autografo di Dio
# Nessuno potrà vivere la mia vita al posto mio
# Per quanto mi identifichi nel battito di un altro
# Sarà sempre attraverso questo cuore
# E giorno dopo giorno passeranno le stagioni
# Ma resterà qualcosa in questa strada
# Non mi è concesso più di delegarti i miei casini
# Mi butto dentro vada come vada
# Siamo come il sole a mezzogiorno baby
# Senza più nessuna ombra intorno...baby
# Un bacio e poi un bacio e poi un bacio e poi altri cento
# Teoricamente il mondo è più leggero di una piuma
# Nessun filo spinato potrà rallentare il vento
# Non tutto quel che brucia si consuma
# E sogno dopo sogno sono sveglio finalmente
# Per fare i conti con le tue promesse
# Un giorno passa in fretta e non c'è tempo di pensare
# Muoviamoci che poi diventa sera...
# Siamo come il sole a mezzogiorno baby
# Senza più nessuna ombra intorno...baby
# Gente che viene
# Gente che va
# Gente che torna
# Gente che sta
# Il sole se la ride in mezzo al cielo
# A guardare noi che ci facciamo il culo
# E' un gioco
# Mezzogiorno di fuoco
# E' un lampo
# Sulle armature
# In guardia
# Niente da capire
# Mi specchio
# In una goccia di sudore
# Siamo come il sole a mezzogiorno baby
# Senza più nessuna ombra intorno...baby.

# Tempo, tempo comunque vadano le cose lui passa e se ne frega se qualcuno è in ritardo puoi chiamarlo bastardo ma tanto è già andato e fino adesso niente lo ha mai fermato e tutt'al più forse lo hai misurato con i tuoi orologi di ogni marca e modello ma tanto il tempo resta sempre lui quello l'unica cosa che ci è data di fare è avere il tempo da poter organizzare si da organizzare da dividere in passi cassa rullante la mia voce ed i bassi bassi medi e alti per fare salti per far ballare il pubblico sugli spalti e non m'annoio e no che non m'annoio e non m'annoio io no che non m'annoio e non m'annoio no che non m'annoio no che non m'annoio tempo 109 battute al minuto quando finisce forse ti sarà piaciuto la chiave per capire questo genere di suono che a molte orecchie può sembrare frastuono e liberare la tua parte migliore chiudere gli occhi aprire bene il cuore che non c'è musica che vale di più di quella musica che vuoi sentire tu e non mi stanco e no che non mi stanco non mi stanco io no che non mi stanco non mi stanco no che non mi stanco no che non mi stanco sono passate 1000 generazioni dai rockabilli punk e capelloni i metallari i paninari e sorcini e ogni volta gli stessi casini perch? i ragazzi non si fanno vedere sono sfuggenti come le pantere e quando li cattura una definizione il mondo è pronto a una nuova generazione e non m'annoio e no che non m'annoio e non m'annoio io no che non m'annoio non m'annoio no che non m'annoio no che non m'annoio io no che non m'annoio tempo prezioso conosco un modo per rimanere a galla non abboccare a questa grande balla del tempo che ti fa cambiare che ti modella e più vai avanti più la vita è meno bella sfuggi dal gruppo e pensa con la tua testa e stare insieme sarà sempre una festa se riuscirai a sopravvivere lontano dal branco non c'è noia non sarai mai stanco sfuggi dal gruppo e non lasciarti fregare e non m'annoio io continuo a ballare e non mi rompo e no che non mi rompo non mi rompo io no che non mi rompo non mi rompo no che non mi rompo no che non mi rompo tempo quando stai bene lui va via come un lampo quando ti annoi un attimo sembra eterno il paradiso può diventare inferno tempo, ti frego con il ritmo ti cattura e ti chiudo in una ritmica di aspetto molto duro e ti organizzo in battute in quattro quarti all'ora non avrai tempo di liberarti e con le gambe muovo anche il cervello e allora il tempo sarà mio fratello e come lui mi darà sempre una mano mi darà tempo per andare lontano e come Ulisse cercherò di ritrovare quella mia isola ma tanto viaggiare sarà piacevole sarà indispensabile anche se l'isola sarà irraggiungibile (ahaaaaa) e non m'annoio e no che non m'annoio non m'annoio io no che non m'annoio non m'annoio no che non m'annoio no che non m'annoio e non mi stanco e no che non mi stanco non mi stanco io no che non mi stanco non mi stanco no che non mi stanco no che non mi stanco e non mi rompo no che non mi rompo non mi rompo io no che non mi rompo non mi rompo no che non mi rompo no che non mi rompo tempo.

# Il nemico si nasconde si mimetizza tra le pieghe della coscienza
# la sua violenza è subdola il suo passo di gatto
# difficile davvero coglierlo sul fatto
# il nemico è tra noi è dentro di noi
# per farlo fuori occorre rinunciare ad una parte di noi stessi
# se un tempo era più facile lottare contro ciò che non andava
# perch? il nemico una faccia ce l'aveva
# una voce, una bandiera
# sapevi dove andare a prenderlo in giro la sera
# aveva nomi e facce, ma non è più
# così adesso non si vede ma lui è ancora lì più forte che mai
# e sotto sotto spinge col suo dai e dai
# e ha stipulato un patto con le coscienze addormentate
# nella pubblicità di una realtà falsificata
# a migliaia di chilometri di distanza da questa
# stanza uomini e bambini schiavizzati, sottopagati
# diritti rubati derubati dell'infanzia in qualche capannone dell'estremo oriente
# lavorano e producono le griffes dell'occidente
# e qui non si sa niente perch? sta bene a tanti
# tacere verità che sono atroci e allucinanti
# pilastri di un'economia vincente dal volto appariscente
# che crea la sua ricchezza con la sofferenza di un sacco di gente
# e quanti dovranno soffrire quante mucche impazzire
# quanta aria velenosa bisognerà respirare
# quanti cibi avvelenati bisognerà divorare
# quante malattie ancora per interesse non si potranno curare
# prima che qualcuno pensi che così non va bene
# ma il nemico si è infiltrato dentro al sangue che ci scorre nelle vene
# nei sorrisi compiacenti di politiche fatte di parole
# all'insegna di "occhio non vede cure non duole"
# il nemico ha il volto sorridente cravatta e doppio petto
# intorno a grandi tavoli fa incetta di rispetto e di sorrisi
# strette di mano accordi tra potenti che non guardano lontano
# e approvano la produzione di mine anti uomo
# di tutti gli armamenti necessari perch? questo sistema
# si mantenga bello saldo sui binari di sangue dove viaggia
# cosicch? anche il coraggio più coraggio si scoraggia
# di fronte a questo gioco dove tutti hanno ragione
# e i peggiori criminali sono tenuti in alta considerazione
# e viaggiano in corsia preferenziale
# rimbalzano sull'ammortizzatore sociale e non si fanno mai male
# e cambiano i governi ed il nemico gli sorride in silenzio
# protetto dalla logica del tacito consenso di chi gode
# di questa situazione che fa comodo a tanti
# tenere alto il livello di paura e le coscienze ignoranti
# paura della povertà paura dell'ignoto
# paura di trovarsi di fronte al grande vuoto di se stessi
# con la coscienza critica in stato di assoluta catalessi
# sconfiggere il nemico è guardarsi dentro
# cercare il proprio centro e dargli vita
# come a un fuoco quasi spento
# renderlo vivo dargli movimento
# il nemico si nasconde spesso in quello che crediamo
# nei moralismi ipocriti
# e nelle trasgressioni controllate e organizzate
# nelle droghe illegali e sottobanco ben distribuite
# il nemico crea falsi nemici per farsi scudo e apparir perbene
# modellerà il suo aspetto e prenderà la forma di ciò che lo contiene
# spacciandosi per libertà ti legherà con le sue catene
# conservare il controllo di ciò che vediamo
# conservare il controllo di ciò che sentiamo
# verificare se sotto l'aspetto invitante di un'esca non sia nascosto un amo.
# sconfiggere il nemico è guardarsi dentro
# cercare il proprio centro e dargli vita come a un fuoco quasi spento renderlo vivo
# e dargli movimento (4v).

# Che mi conosci bene come la tua pelle
# Questa mattina quando te sei uscita prima di me
# Sono rimasto a letto a guardar le stelle
# Disteso dalla parte tua
# Con il tuo calore ancora di terra di sogni che non so comprendere
# Io trattenevo il respiro
# Per sentire il silenzio
# Di una stanza quando non ci sei
# Abbracciavo il cuscino
# Per cercare il profumo
# Di una notte dai capelli tuoi? e non ci riuscirò mai?. Mai
# A dirti quanto bella sei.. sei
# Quanta vita mi dai? dai
# E quello che tu sei per me? per me.. per me?per me?.per me?

# Il tuono che precede il lampo
# La cassaforte del mio tempo
# E? difficile poi
# Ritrovarsi tra noi
# Con addosso dieci anni insieme
# L?abitudine sai è il peggiore dei guai
# Si diventa come due vecchi comici
# Che non ridono più
# Che non inventano più
# Che sono li a rassicurare il pubblico
# Io ti amo.. e mi vergogno anche un po?

# Ragazze voi mi fate impazzire con questo rap io ve lo voglio dire e non lo faccio così tanto per fare il ruffiano ma parlo nel microfono col cuore in mano specialmente adesso che ho raggiunto un'età che mi permette di apprezzare con semplicità la bellezza e le caratteristiche diverse delle donne ritrovate delle donne perse tra il pensiero di piacere e quello di innamorarsi tra la voglia di una fuga e quella di sposarsi di far l'amore con tutti quelli che ti pare o di sceglierti un uomo e di portarlo all'altare e di fronte a questo dubbio a questo combattimento i vostri occhi mi riempiono di sentimento quando io vi vedo sole in mezzo a tanta gente nel rumore di una musica che non vale niente se non fossi accompagnata dai tuoi movimenti che ci accendono la carica volenti e nolenti e noi che grazie a quel serpente vi giriamo intorno a cercare nella notte un attimo di giorno per parlare con gli amici con parole condite da concetti e da espressioni (ehe) colorite e trovarsi poi da soli sotto le coperte a sognare di leccare le ferite aperte da esperienze e da storie da facce da sguardi dalla voglia di ricominciare ma è troppo tardi il pensiero vola e va a posarsi sul davanzale di una casa sul confine tra il bene e il male tra l'amore e il sesso tra il corpo e la mente per concludere che in fondo in fondo è divertente il continuo dondolare di tutte le cose questa falsa divisione tra puttane e spose ragazze voi mi fate impazzire a partire dalla mamma fino ad arrivare al concetto quello mistico della Madonna figlia madre moglie fidanzata sorella e nonna sempre dentro una di queste categorie e va cadere la mia mente le ragazze mie e io con questo lungo rap io vi racconto tutto anche se certi momenti può sembrarvi brutto ma io ascolto tanta musica mattina e sera la stagione che io amo di più la primavera quando sbocciano sugli alberi i germogli dei fiori e la gente ricomincia a stare un po' più fuori e le ragazze di città prendono il motorino e si siedono proprio sul bordo del sellino con capelli sciolti guidano con aria sicura e guardandole la vita sembra meno dura e quel sole che le illumina e le fa più belle in quel giorno sarà il re di tutte le altre stelle e il pensiero vola e va a posarsi sul davanzale di una casa sul confine tra il bene e il male tra l'amore e il sesso il corpo e la mente e per concludere che in fondo in fondo è divertente il continuo dondolare di tutte le cose questa falsa divisione tra puttane e spose il pensiero vola e va a posarsi sul davanzale di una casa sul confine tra il bene e il male tra l'amore e il sesso il corpo e la mente per concludere che in fondo in fondo è divertente il continuo dondolare di tutte le cose questa falsa divisione tra puttane e spose

# Vorrei che tu avessi un nuovo ragazzo vorrei che ti trattasse bene che ti facesse sentire importante e che ti bolle il sangue nelle vene quando ti aspetterà sotto il portone per fare un giro, magari a cena mi piacerebbe che tu toccassi il cielo quando di notte ti bacia la schiena che ti parlasse dei suoi problemi e che non li tenesse tutti per s? come me vorrei vedervi magari sposati e che lui stesse sempre con te che non ti facesse incazzare mai che non dimentichi i compleanni che sia simpatico ai tuoi genitori e che li faccia diventare nonni ma quando un giorno sarai lontana e vedrai il cielo quando si colora pensami almeno per un momento pensami almeno per mezz'ora vorrei sapere come ti va, eh? ora che non stiamo più insieme che mi hanno detto che hai sofferto un po' che però ora stai bene certo, all'inizio tutto era pazzesco non smettevamo mai di stare a letto di combinarne di porcherie e guarda ora, chi l'avrebbe detto esco di casa alle tre di notte con quattro amici ce ne andiamo a caccia per rimediare un amore facile che il giorno dopo non ricordo la faccia ma quando un giorno sarai lontana e vedrai il cielo quando si colora pensami almeno per un momento pensami almeno per mezz'ora e quando son qui dentro il mio letto vuoto vorrei dormire e non è facile quando non sai se sia possibile innamorarsi e non lasciarsi mai poi quando un giorno sarai lontana e vedrai il cielo quando si colora pensami per un momento pensami almeno per mezz'ora ma quando un giorno sarai lontana e vedrai il cielo quando si colora pensami almeno per un momento pensami almeno per mezz'ora.

# O signore dell'universo
# ascolta questo figlio disperso
# che ha perso il filo e non sa dov'è
# e che non sa neanche più parlare con te.
# Ho un Cristo che pende sopra il mio cuscino
# e un Buddha sereno sopra il comodino
# conosco a memoria il Cantico delle Creature
# grandissimo rispetto per le mille sure
# del Corano; c'ho pure un talismano
# che me l'ha regalato un mio fratello africano
# e io lo so che tu da qualche parte ti riveli
# che non sei solamente chiuso dietro ai cieli
# e nelle rappresentazioni umane di te
# a volte io ti vedo in tutto quello che c'è
# e giro per il mondo tra i miei alti e bassi
# e come Pollicino lascio indietro dei sassi sui miei passi
# per non dimenticare la strada che ho percorso fino ad arrivare qua
# e ora dove si va adesso
# si riparte per un'altra città.
# Voglio andare a casa LA CASA DOV'E'???
# La casa dove posso stare
# Io voglio andare a casa LA CASA DOV'E'???
# La casa dove posso stare con pace con te.
# O Signore dei viaggiatori
# ascolta questo figlio immerso nei colori
# che crede che la luce sia sempre una sola
# che si distende sulle cose e le colora
# di rosso di blu di giallo di vita
# dalle tonalità di varietà infinita
# ascoltami proteggimi
# ed il cammino quando è buio illuminami
# sono qua in giro per la città
# e provo con impegno a interpretare la realtà
# cercando il lato buono delle cose
# cercandoti in zone pericolose
# ai margini di ciò che è convenzione
# di ciò che è conformismo di ogni moralismo yeahhh
# e il mondo mi somiglia nelle sue contraddizioni
# mi specchio nelle situazioni
# e poi ti prego di rivelarti sempre in ciò che vedo
# io so che tu mi ascolti anche se a volte non ci credo
# Voglio andare a casa LA CASA DOV'E'???
# La casa dove posso stare
# Io voglio andare a casa LA CASA DOV'E'???
# La casa dove posso stare con pace con te.
# O Signore della mattina che bussa sulle palpebre quando mi sveglio
# mi giro e mi rigiro sopra il mio giaciglio
# e poi faccio entrare il mondo dentro me
# e dentro al mondo entro fino a notte
# barriere confini paure serrature
# cancelli dogane e facce scure
# sono arrivato qua attraverso mille incroci
# di uomini di donne di occhi e di voci
# il gallo che canta e la città si sveglia
# ed un pensiero vola giù alla mia famiglia
# e poi si allarga fino al mondo intero
# e poi su vola alto fino al cielo
# il sole la luna e Marte e giove
# saturno coi suoi anelli e poi le stelle nuove
# e quelle anziane piene di memoria
# che con la loro luce hanno fatto la storia
# gloria a tutta l'energia che c'è nell'aria
# Questa è la mia casa LA CASA DOV'E'
# la casa dove posso portar pace
# Io voglio andare a casa la CASA DOV'E'
# Questa è la mia casa LA CASA DOV'E'
# la casa dove posso stare in pace con te.

# Sai qual è il problema che poi non è un problema che quando io sto bene non c'è niente che io tema e so per esperienza qui la rappo e qui lo scrivo com'è difficile fermarsi e dire preservativo aspettami piccina un minuto solamente è facile che l'animale l'abbia vinta sulla mente ma devo tener duro e lottare con ardore un tempo erano piattole adesso si muore è dura ma è possibile anche per noi che lo facciamo perch? fare l'amore è ancora il massimo che abbiamo adeguarsi ai nuovi metodi per vivere 100 anni cancellando tradizioni e miti vivi da millenni inserendo un terzo incomodo di gomma puzzolente per amore di se stessi e per rispetto della gente un ragazzo è spesso teso a pensare solo a se stesso specialmente se gli capita una storia di sesso ma le cose stan cambiando è ancora lungo il cammino è la festa nazionale con la data del vaccino e della sua grande scoperta è ancora lontana sia per chi va con la santa che per chi va con la puttana c'è chi dice che è un flagello una pena da scontare una mossa della chiesa che non vuol farci scopare una piaga che punisce solamente i peggiori che con quello che combinano forse è meglio farli fuori e ci pensa allora lui, il nostro virus giustiziere che colpisce chi non sa come far uso del sedere e questo pregiudizio contribuisce a fondo a far si che il bastardo vada in giro per il mondo a far si che il bastardo vada in giro per la terra a seminare morte come fa solo la guerra la chiesa dal suo canto ci da il suo contributo perch? il virus dell'AIDS si trasmetta indisturbato ancora che condanna la contraccezione e giù con gli anatemi contro la nazione io penso che l'amore sia tutto nella vita e sono fortunati quelli che han la fidanzata e si amano da pazzi e faranno 100 figli e nella loro storia non avranno mai sbadigli però purtroppo oggi non è sempre Natale e a volte ti succede che le storie vanno male e allora si va in giro e si hanno delle storie e capita che a volte si finisce a fare l'amore anche senza coronare con il sentimento puro e allora se c'è il sesso almeno fa che sia sicuro e non pensare che riguardi solamente certa gente riguarda tutti noi sintonizza la tua mente son sicuro che Dio c'è non si spiegherebbe il vento ma però sono anche certo che arriva il momento che noi povere creature dobbiam darci una mossa se vogliamo ritardare il nostro sonno nella fossa perch? Dio c'ha dato il via poi ha detto vai figliolo adesso la tua storia te la tiri su da solo con gli ostacoli del caso certi giorni ed altri meno che rannuvolano il cielo che non sia troppo sereno per esempio prendi l'AIDS, al di là di tutti i morti ha portato tutti noi poveri cristi ai ferri corti e la mia generazione è cresciuta sessualmente con lo spettro del bacillo sempre intorno alla sua mente deve dire a tutti quanti oh ragazzi state attenti fatelo quanto volete ma siate previdenti magic Johnson lui è un mito uno sceso dalla luna ma di fronte a questo mal non ti serve la fortuna Freddie Mercury che voce anche lui finito male per capire come viaggia fatti un giro in ospedale questo virus è un bastardo ma non deve aver la meglio guarda bene dove vai apri gli occhi resta sveglio la mia generazione e quella di altra gente all'idea di questo rischio sintonizza la sua mente io nel mio piccolino qui la rappo e qui la scrivo quando non conosco a fondo metto su il preservativo

# E ALLORA VIA SI VA VIA SI VA SI VA VIA IN CULO A QUESTA NOTTE E PURE ALLA POLIZIA LA STRADA LA CONOSCO E QUESTA MACCHINA DI PAPA' STASERA CHE HO BEVUTO SEMBRA CHE VADA LA META'
# e io che da dieci anni torno a casa a quest'ora all'ora che di solito la gente poi lavora girando le statali dalla uno alla mille ho visto tante macchine poi far le scintille con la carrozzeria che grattava il catrame ho visto le lamiere diventare come lame sull'asfalto ho visto macchine come lattine d'aranciata accartocciarsi intorno a un albero dopo una sbandata e allora non c'è sabato che in una provinciale non c'è lo stronzo che mi sorpassa male in curva sulla destra mi passa a centottanta diretto verso il buio di questi anni novanta e io sono un deejay e il lunedì c'ho la nausea non posso poi non chiedermi qual è la causa, ma poi me ne dimentico e in fondo son sincero a quello del sorpasso io dedico un pensiero, pensiero di fratello pensiero un po' tetro è brutto quando sbagli non poter tornare indietro; ripenso a tutti i miti della gioventù bruciata al mito dell'eccesso alla vita spericolata fanculo alla ferrari e pure al maggiolino non valgono il sacrificio neanche di un moscerino spiaccicato sopra al vetro di un sabato da pazzi niente giudizi però per quei ragazzi sono figli di questo tempo che ha poco tempo per le morali sono ragazzi, ragazzi "normali" figli di questo tempo un po' malato nei contenuti che questo rap sia un monumento ai caduti di una guerra che fa vittime di diciotto anni sacrificate al dio dei grandi inganni comunque tutto questo non fa parte del mio lavoro tutto questo va molto oltre ogni stupido coro di questi moralizzatori che san sempre ciò che è giusto che in fondo al lunedì mattina ci provan gusto tutto questo con gli orari di chiusura dei locali con la birra e con gli amari c'entra poco lo dico perch? ho sempre fatto tardi e chi ha in mano la risposta sono dei bugiardi io non ho risposta alcuna ho soltanto la mia rabbia nel vedere molta gente come me dentro una gabbia nel vedere che la libertà diventa paradosso e la trovi la mattina spiaccicata dentro a un fosso...

# Si danza prima del sesso o di un combattimento
# Si danza per riscaldarsi dal freddo che fa
# Si danza per imitare il lavoro del vento
# Quando non so dove sono io mi sento a casa
# Quando non so con chi sono mi sento in compagnia
# Quando c'è troppa virtù il cuore mi si intasa

# L'antico impero cinese accolse Marco Polo
# Perchè era un giovane mercante di immaginazione
# Non servono grandi ali per spiccare il volo
# La vita è molto più vasta di una definizione
# E stanno tutti aspettando che succeda qualcosa
# Che tolga il velo di polvere dalla realtà
# E stanno tutti aspettando che arrivi la sposa
# Coi fiori in mano e una promessa di felicità
# Problemi di digestione ispirano romanzi
# Rivelazioni che nascono nell'acidità
# Un pò di bicarbonato dopo certi pranzi
# Si eviterebbe lo scontro delle civiltà
# Gli uccelli volano bassi e sfiorano l'asfalto
# E i cani stanno in silenzio con aria d'attesa

# Ma quello che anche se perde non è vinto mai
# L'intelligenza è nel corpo il sapere nel cuore
# Se pensi sempre ad un muro un muro troverai
# Mi son trovato memorie che non sono mie
# Ho un solo nome ma almeno cento identità
# E' naturale preferire le belle bugie
# Alla durezza di ghiaccio di certe verità
# Viviamo comodi dentro alle nostre virgolette
# Ma il mondo è molto più grande più grande di così
# Se uno ha imparato a contare fino a sette

# gridandomi di andare e di non tornare più
# io ho fatto finta di uscire e tu hai acceso la tv
# e mentre un comico faceva ridere io ti ho sentito che piangevi
# allora son tornato ma tanto già lo sapevi
# che tornavo da te senza niente da dire senza tante parole
# ma con in mano un raggio di sole
# per te che sei lunatica
# niente teorie con te soltanto pratica
# praticamente amore
# ti porto in dono un raggio di sole per te
# un raggio di sole per te
# che cosa pensi tu
# se dico amore dimmi cosa intendi
# siamo andati al mare e mi parlavi di montagna
# abbiamo preso una casa in città e sogni la campagna
# con gli uccellini le anatre e le oche
# i delfini i conigli le api i papaveri e le foche
# e ogni tanto ti perdo o mi perdo nei miei guai
# ho lo zaino già pronto all'ingresso ma poi tanto tu già lo sai
# che ritorno da te...

$ Il Quinto Mondo
# Io sono un uomo
# non so se hai presente un uomo
# quello creato il sesto giorno prima delle ferie
# quello che in molti vorrebbero fatto in serie
# quello che ormai si sa quasi tutto
# genetica mente simile al maiale
# quello agli altri uomini diverso ma uguale
# quello che si riunisce con i parenti a natale
# quello educato, inscatolato
# da mille telecamere 24 ore al giorno controllato
# quello con il suo angolo segreto
# dove sfogare le sue frustrazioni
# quello pieno di limiti e limitazioni
# che si redime bruciando nel fuoco delle passioni
# io sono un uomo
# non so se hai presente un uomo
# ma che bella sensazione mi dà
# allentare la mia rigidità
# essere un essere umano soltanto
# nel riso nel pianto e negli sbagli miei
# io sono un uomo
# non so se hai presente un uomo
# quello che istintivamente
# teme per la sorte dei suoi cari
# che si caccia sempre in brutti affari
# sdraiato sull'erba guarda passare le nuvole
# e prova un senso di stupore di fronte al creato
# di cui teoricamente lui è l'essere meglio riuscito
# di cui teoricamente lui è l'essere più evoluto
# io sono un uomo
# quello creato maschio e femmina
# ma che non sempre si riconosce in queste categorie
# quello indagato dalle varie psicologie
# che pende dalle labbra di filosofi,
# scienziati, politici e preti
# che ama la libertà ma si appassiona ai divieti
# io sono un uomo
# non so se hai presente un uomo
# ma che bella sensazione mi dà
# allentare la mia rigidità
# essere un essere umano vivente
# sotto un cielo potente che mi tira su
# ho due gambe due braccia un cuore una faccia
# e un sacco di idee
# ma non so più quale sono le mie
# aiaiaiaiaiaiai
# ullallallalla
# ma mia vita è un mistero
# scusi sa dov'è il bagno?
# mi sono perso
# scusi sa che ore sono
# da che parte è il centro?
# c'è qualcuno che mi prende sul serio?
# io sono un uomo non so se hai presente
# e non è tutto sai?
# puoi trovarmi nel centro di Milano
# dentro una caverna o sopra un aeroplano
# ansiogeno misogino dentro a un lacrimogeno
# oppure intento a scindere l'atomo di idrogeno
# in una fila di macchine davanti a una puttana
# o a casa di mia suocera nel fine settimana
# a sfogliare riviste di moda tra attrazione e rabbia
# a spalmarmi creme a fare castelli di sabbia
# in ginocchio di fronte a un amore finito
# al sicuro nascosto dietro al mio dito
# bello come il sole in una mattina di primavera
# rimesso in discussione già quando arriva la sera
# io sono un uomo
# non so se hai presente un uomo
# che ci faccio qui?
# essere un essere umano di sangue
# di spirito e carne e di fragilità
# io sono un uomo
# non so se hai presente un uomo
# e sono ogni fiore che ho annusato
# ogni merda che ho pestato
# ogni occhio che ho incrociato
# ogni cibo che ho mangiato
# ogni libro che ho interrotto
# ogni giocattolo che ho rotto
# ma anche di più
# molto di più di questo
# qualcuno sa come va a finire?

# Verse 1 :
# I knew when I saw you
# I knew when you came into my life

# And someone must have told you
# Someone saw the difference in my eyes
# When you're by my side I realized that

# A heart so real, a love so true
# Baby I wanna say
# That you took the pain away

# Verse 2 :
# I've learned many lessons
# From others with no love in their lives
# How can that be right
# And I've had many questions
# But I always believed  I see the light
# Shining in your eyes
# Cause that's where I wanna be
# Baby just you and me

# Where there is no reason why

# And I can give my love to you

# Loving You comes to me
# (Actual Singing)
# It comes like Second Nature like
# Breathing in, breathing out
# Something I don't think about
# It comes like Second Nature
# Second Nature
# Second Nature
# Like an instinct
# That I can't control
# I always turn to You
# It's a spiritual thing
# A thirst in my soul
# That makes me run
# Into your arms and to the place
# Our hearts collide where
# everything comes clear
# And I see, from the start
# This is how love was meant to be
# (Chorus)
# It's so obvious
# I was born for this
# Born for a love like this
# And I know for sure
# I've been captured
# There is no escaping this...
# (Chorus)
> Joy Williams
# Run, it's always your instinct
# Run, it feels like the right thing to turn your back and run
# Where, where are you going as fast as you can run
# Slow down, come on, take a breath
# Why don't you rest
# What's your hurry
# C'mon
# Chorus: Stay
# Just Stay
# You're where you're meant to be
# You're no runaway
# Why don't you stay
# So long, yesterday's gone
# So long to all of your worries that won't add a day to life
# Slow down, come on, take a breath
# Why don't you rest
# What's your hurry
# C'mon
# Chorus
# Lay your weary head down in the fields of green
# Soak your soul now in the quiet streams
# Chorus
# Where, where are you going as fast as you can
> Joy Williams
# There are places in my heart and corners of my mind
# That I've hidden from Your light
# Like buried treasure deep inside of me
# I don't want You to see, I keep it to myself
# But You give Your love to me
# You open up Your heart unselfishly
# Lord, in Your embrace now I can say, I surrender
# CHORUS
# Everything I held so precious
# Everything I kept away
# I give it up, give it up
# All for You, I give it all for You
# Everything I held as treasure
# I give it all for You, I give it all for You
# In Your light, I feel a new power coming over me
# Calling me to Your surrender; I gotta find the answer
# What is this Your love has opened up inside?
# Suddenly I cannot hide
# You give Your love to me
# You open up Your heart unselfishly
# Lord, in Your embrace now I can say, I surrender
# CHORUS
# 'Cause Your love is everything to me
# And in Your light I finally see
# Oh, I can't hold it back
# Everything I've hidden deep inside
# Now I surrender
# Surrender, Lord, I surrender
# I give it all to You
# You give Your love to me
# You open up Your heart unselfishly
# How can I not do the same for You?
# I surrender
# CHORUS
> Joy Williams
# In all that I have found
# Your evidence abounds
# I've always sensed Your fingerprints
# If I just look around
# And yet this grand display
# Will all soon pass away
# So I hold onto the mighty truth
# That Your love is here to stay
# The love of the Lord endures
# The love of the Lord endures
# If there's one thing I can be sure
# It's that the love of the Lord endures
# Life has let me down
# In wealth joy, can't be found
# I've searched for peace in all of these
# But I have always found
# The love of the Lord endures
# The love of the Lord endures
# If there's one thing I can be sure
# The love of the Lord endures
# When I stumble, when I fall
# When I'm walking ten feet tall
# Your love is there day after day
# Even at the worst extreme
# Or after I have been redeemed
# Your love is there
# And it won't let me go
# The love of the Lord endures
# The love of the Lord endures
# If there's one thing I can be sure
# It's that the love of the Lord endures
# The love of the Lord endures
# Forever, Forever
> Joy Williams
# Most live a lifetime and never see
# The soul of tomorrow in someone's eyes
# Some give up on all of their dreams
# One second before they materialize
# But love broke through walls of stone
# It was You, it was You alone
# Chorus:
# You crack the sky like broken glass
# You rescued me when my chance had passed
# Sometimes things aren't as hard as you may think
# Because all you need is just a touch of faith
# Some never ever turn a key
# To the door of their heart's desires
# Too afraid to fall somewhere in between
# Tomorrow's fears and the pressure's fire
# Your love broke through walls of stone
# It was You, it was You alone
# Chorus
# Your touch pushed back the clouds just like the sun
# Your hand pulled me out of the hardest time
# That I've ever known, that I ever knew
# Oh Lord, that was all because I met You
# Your love broke through walls of stone
# It was You, it was You alone
# Chorus (fade a million times)
> Joy Williams
# For just a moment I wish I could have been there
# to see your first step
# to hear your very first word
# tell me did you ever fall and scrape your knee
# did you know your wounds would one day heal the world
# For just one moment I wish I could have seen you growing,
# learning the ways of a capenter's son
# just a little boy gazing at the stars
# did you remember creating every one
# if you passed by would I see a child or a king
# or would i have known
# Chorus:
# I wish I could have been there
# My only wish is to see you face to face
# I wish I could have been there
# just to see you Jesus face to face
# For just one moment I wish I could have been there
# when you left your footprints upon the waves
# to walk along beside you never look away
# just your whisper and the wind and sea obey
# to see you feed the people
# to feel the healing in your touch
# I wish I could have been there
# Chorus
# To hear you pray in the garden alone
# laying down your will with each tear
# to see you walk that lonely road
# willing to die for me
# and in that
# moment I know I should have been there
# you took my cross and gave your life
# But you live again
# I wish I could have been there
# I wish that I could have seen you rise again
# I wish I could have been there
# My only wish is to see you face to face
# someday i'll be there
# I'm gonna be there
# I'll see your face
# your mercy and grace
# someday
# someday I'm gonna see you Jesus face to face
> Joyce yeo
# Now that we're alone
# No more hide and seek
# You are the highest dream to me
# And as you softly sleep
# Then I can tell you what it means
# Locked in my arms like lovers lie
# I will not let you slip away
# Is this the summer of them all
# Is this my night of nights
# That you came to stay
# Here you are owner of my heart
# Just the way that love should be
# And there is something I must say to you
# If you promise to believe
# That it's you I'm living for
# And I could not love you more
# Seasons may come and seasons go
# But these are the truest words I know
# Face to face
# Eye to eye
# This is the summer of our lives
# One love that cannot die
# Here you are owner of my soul
# Never let you say good bye
# And there is something I must say to you
# We leave the world outside
# And you have come to me
# At last, we start
# Open up your heart
# Let my deepest love inside
# I'm only doing what I have to do
# If you promise to believe
# And I could not love you more
# Here you are owner of my heart
# Just the way that love should be
# And there is something I must say to you
# We leave the world outside
# And you have come to me
# At last, we start
# Open up your heart
# Let my deepest love inside
# I'm only doing what I have to do
# If you promise to believe
# That it's you I'm living for
# And I could not love you more

# Tam dolenci za vasjo
# Je ovčice pasla
# Lepa mlada Nežika
# Rožica prekrasna
# Za ljubezen je bila
# Malo še premlada
# Radovednost jo je fto
# Vleklo kar močno.
# Pa privriska čez goro
# S harmoniko mlad Francel
# Jo poprime za roko
# Da bi vzel ji krancel
# Tega dati ti ne smem
# So mi rekli mati
# Saj nedolžnost naj bi bla samo za Boga.
# Francel pa takoj si je nekaj lepga zmislu
# Da gre Bogu špilati za rojstni dan nocoj
# In nedolžnosti lahko odnese tudi zraven
# Da prišla bo v večni raj vse za vekomaj.
# Se takoj je strinjala hlačice dol dala
# Ko položi jo na tla vsa srečna je bila
# Še poprej ko se zave kaj je sploh storila
# Je nedolžnost njena že Bogu rajžala.

# Juhuhu juhuhu tak je tak je lušno blo,
# Juhuhu juhuhu tak je tak je lušno blo,
# Juhuhu juhuhu tak je tak je lušno blo,
# Juhuhu juhuhu kdaj bo spet teku.
# Ko domov privriska
# K mamici vesela
# Že po rit peliska
# Palica debela
# Ti naiv naivnica
# Kaj si mu verjela
# Saj je muzi muzikant
# Ta velik prevarant.
# Drugi dan pa zopet
# šla je tja na pašo
# nič ni bla vesela
# ker je rit bolela
# ko pa pride Francel k njej
# se je pokesala
# žal mi je pa prav močno
# da teb sem dala jo.
# Francel potolaži jo
# Pove ji to novico
# Da Boga ni blo doma
# Nazaj jo lahko da
# Nežika presrečna vsa
# Hlačice dol dala
# Kaj potem se pa zgodi
# Si mislite sami.

# Daria hasta mi vida y mi fusil, mis botas y mi fe
# Por eso en la trinchera de mi soledad
# Tus ojos son mi luz y tu esplendor mi corazón
# Y si no fuera por ti yo no podria vivir
# En el vacio de estos dias de no saber
# Y si no fuera por ti yo no seria feliz
# Como lo soy cuando con tus besos me veo partir
# Y es que solo con saber que al regresar
# Tu esperaras por mi
# Aumentan los latidos de mi corazón
# Volverte a ver es todo lo que quiero hacer
# Volverte a ver para poderme reponer
# Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
# Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene raiz
# Ni una razón para vivir
# lo unico que quiero es poder regresar
# Poder todas las balas esquivar y sobrevivir
# Tu amor es mi esperanza y tu mi munición
# Por eso regresar a ti es mi unica misión
# Y si no fuera por ti yo no podria vivir
# En el vacio de estos dias de no saber
# Y si no fuera por ti yo no seria feliz
# Como lo soy cuando con tus besos me veo partir
# Y es que solo con saber que al regresar
# Tu esperaras por mi
# Aumentan los latidos de mi corazón
# Volverte a ver es todo lo que quiero hacer
# Volverte a ver para poderme reponer
# Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
# Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene raiz
# Ni una razón para vivir
# Eres todo lo que tengo
# Y no me quiero morir
# sin poder otra vez
# Volverte a ver
# Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
# Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene raiz
# Volverte a ver es todo lo que quiero hacer
# Volverte a ver para poderme reponer
# Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
# Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene raiz
# Ni una razón para vivir

# Before the dawn, I hear you whisper
# In your sleep "Don't let the morning take him"
# Outside the birds begin to call
# As if to summon up my leaving
# It's been a lifetime since I found someone
# Since I found someone who would stay
# I've waited too long, and now you're leaving
# Oh please don't take it all away
# It's been a lifetime since I found someone
# Since I found someone who would stay
# I've waited too long, and now you're leaving
# Oh please don't take it all away
# Before the dawn, I hear you whisper
# In your sleep "Don't let the morning take him"

# I've been trying
# There's no denying.
# It's sending me
# Out of my mind.
# I've seen reason
# Change to treason.
# It's losing its sense
# Of all kind.
# How much longer will it take
# For the world to see.
# We should learn to live
# And simply let it be.
# Bloodstone, bloodstone.
# In the night time
# Wake in fright.
# I'm so scared of the game
# That's being played.
# Start to wonder
# What's going under.
# And how many deals
# Have been made.
# Bloodstone.
# I can't take it.
# You got me living
# On a bloodstone
# I don't want that bloodstone.
> Judas Priest
# You stitch me up good, and you cut me down
# So I string you up to keep you hanging around
# You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting
# So I'll play it dirty 'til your body is breaking
# We've got to make love, the time is right
# We've got to make love tonight
# 'Cause we're burnin' up
# You make me greedy, you won't feed me my food
# But I'll make out easy, 'cause I see straight through you
# You cool me off and hot me up and that's not right
# 'Cause you'll get hungry in the heat of the night
# And then we'll make love, just when it's right
# And when we make love tonight
# We'll be burnin' up
# I know you feel the same
# I know you feel the flame
# Staring deep inside of you
# Burnin' you up, breaking you down
# Breakin' you out in a cold sweat
# And as you lose control, of your very soul
# Your desire takes over
# You'll feel the heat sway
# You're round to my way
# And suddenly you'll know that you're burnin' up
# You stitch me up good, and you cut me down
# So I string you up to keep you hanging around
# You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting
# So I'll play it dirty 'til your body is breaking
# We've got to make love, the time is right
# We've got to make love tonight
# 'Cause we're burnin' up
# We're burnin' up

# I got home late this evening, stumbled up the stair
# I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the bedroom there
# My woman with a man was lyin' fast asleep
# I felt a rage inside me, control I couldn't keep
# She was a cheater
# I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door
# I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded .44
# By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do
# I scream you cheatin' bitch here's what I think of you
# You are a cheater
# They both pleaded for mercy, I said no way
# When you do this upon me, you have no say
# I treated you so real good, and this is what you do
# Oh no I've finished with you, your time is through
# You are a cheater
# If you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one
# There's no neater, come on here and meet her
# Cheater, cheater, cheater, come on and meet her...
> Judas Priest
# We are defenders of the faith
# (Repeat into infinity and fade)
> Judas Priest
# Feeling like we're, ready to kick tonight
# No hesitating, my bodies aching
# Looking for some action, satisfaction all right
# Charging, vein faced, as active as one-hundred solid proof
# Mega town, Leviathan, we're ready to hit the roof
# You better watch out and hold on tight
# We're heading your way like dynamite
# Uhhh, Delivering the goods
# Uhhh, Delivering the goods
# Shake down, rock 'em boys, crack that whip strap mean
# Pulse rave, air waves, battle lies in every place we've been
# Stealing your hearts all across the land
# Hot blood doing good, we're going to load you with our brand
# You better watch out and hold on tight
# We're heading your way like dynamite
# Uhhh, Delivering the goods
# Yeah, Delivering the goods
# Have your way
# Stealing your hearts
# Well we don't pull no punches, we aim where the crunch is
# The bound to do most damage to your brain
# If you're looking for it mellow
# you're nothing more than yellow
# Gonna do it again and again
# We'll beat you to submission
# So you might as well surrender
# You do gotta learn your lesson
# 'Cause there ain't nobody here to defend your heart
# Faster, higher
# 'Til it seems that we're gonna break
# Ohh shootin' further, giving more than you're ever gonna take
# Weaving with your heads
# Crushed out on the floor
# Begging for mercy
# Be careful or we'll do it some more
# You better watch out and hold on tight
# We're heading your way like dynamite
# Uhhh, Delivering the goods
# Uhhh, Delivering the goods

# Hypnotize me
# Mesmerize me
# Feel my willpower slip.
# Light my fire
# With cold desire
# Losing all my grip.
# Eat my diamonds
# Drinkin' all my gin
# Feast your eyes on
# A whole lotta sin.
# On no you're so damned wicked
# You got me by the throat
# Oh no got your claws stuck in my
# You never let me go
# I believe you're the devil
# I believe you're the devil's child.
# Took my dreams
# And now it seems you're nothing but a liar
# Smash and grab at all I had
# Build my funeral pyre.
# Stop pretendin'
# Got me growin' old
# Your tormentin's
# Fit to snap my soul.
# You took my heart
# And left it blown to smithereens.
# I gave my body as a slave
# You cut my flesh
# And drank my blood that poured in streams
# I'm left here broken and ashamed.
# Goin' under
# Hear the thunder
# Death defying grace.
# Your condition breeds ammunition
# Shoots me in the face.
# Vivious talkin'
# Stabs me like a knife
# Scratched and bruised, so abused
# I'm a human sacrifice.
# Your request matches 1 albums and 10 songs.

# I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
# But that's not unusual
# It's just that the moon is full
# And you decided to call
# And here I sit, hand on the telephone
# Hearing the voice I'd known
# A couple of light years ago
# Headed straight for a fall
# But we both know what memories can bring
# They bring Diamonds and Rust
# Yes we both know what memories can bring
# They bring Diamonds and Rust
# Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around
# and snow in your hair
# Now we're smiling out the window of the
# crummy hotel over Washington Square
# Our breath comes in white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air
# Speaking strictly for me we both could've died then and there
# Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
# Then give me another word for it
# You were so good with words
# And at keeping things vague
# Cause I need some of that vagueness now
# It's all come back too clearly, yes, I love you dearly
# And if you're offering me diamonds and rust, I've already paid
# But we both know what memories can bring
# They bring Diamonds and Rust
# Yes we both know what memories can bring
# They bring Diamonds and Rust
# Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust
# Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust
# Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust
# Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust

# Grand canyons of space and time universal
# My mind is subjected to all
# Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
# Hooks to my brain are well in
# Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
# I know what I am, I'm Berlin
# Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
# I face the impregnable wall
# Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
# Hooks to my brain are well in
# Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
# I know what I am, I'm Berlin
# Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending
# Until I give out my last breath
# I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
# Hooks to my brain are well in
# I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
> Judas Priest
# Standing by my window, breathing summer breeze
# Saw a figure floating, 'neath the willow tree
# Asked us if we were happy, we said we didn't know
# Took us by the hands and up we go
# We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds
# He could control our sense of time
# We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried
# Everyone was in peace of mind
# We felt the sensations drift inside our frames
# Finding complete contentment there
# And all the tensions that hurt us in the past
# Just seemed to vanish in thin air
# He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound
# That is vibrating constantly
# And if we could grip and hold on to the note
# We would see our minds were free...oh they're free
# We are lost above
# Floating way up high
# If you think you can find a way
# You can surely try
> Judas Priest
# Came in this morning high on a bird's wing
# Quite open minded but still quite aware
# Followed the sunrise right through from dawning
# Picking out landmarks that said I was there
# Led to positions by stern faced leaders
# Who never let one smile depart from their face
# Then with an arm raise the slaughter is started
# One or two crack up and start to cry
# Selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow
# Every few moments I see I friend die
# Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight
# As into the battle we are all led
# Killer, killer, keep your thoughts at bay
# Maiming, destroying, every single day
# Is this the way that you get your fun
# Slaying, waylaying, in the heat of the midday sun
# Get out, get out, go and do your job
# Rape and pillage, squander all and rob
# You make me sick, getting paid for murder
# You wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh no
# You never ever dream to hurt her
# Hero, hero, you have done so well
# So sit back and lick your wounds, cause you won't go to hell
# Take your medal, wear it now with pride
# Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside
> Judas Priest
# Wrapped tight around me
# Like a second flesh hot skin
# Cling to my body
# As the ecstasy begins
# Your wild vibrations
# Got me shooting from the hip
# Crazed and insatiable let rip
# Eat me alive
# Sounds like an animal
# Panting to the beat
# Groan in the pleasure zone
# Gasping from the heat
# Gut-wrenching frenzy
# That deranges every joint
# I'm gonna force you at gun point
# To eat me alive
# Bound to deliver as
# You give and I collect
# Squealing impassioned as
# The rod of steel injects
# Lunge to the maximum
# Spread-eagled to the wall
# You're well equipped to take it all
# So eat me alive
> Judas Priest
# Up here in space
# I'm looking down on you.
# My lasers trace
# Everything you do.
# You think you've private lives
# Think nothing of the kind.
# There is no true escape
# I'm watching all the time.
# I'm made of metal
# My circuits gleam.
# I am perpetual
# I keep the country clean.
# I'm elected electric spy
# I protected electric eye.
# Always in focus
# You can't feel my stare.
# I zoom into you
# You don't know I'm there.
# I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
# My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove.
# Electric eye, in the sky
# Feel my stare, always there
# There's nothing you can do about it.
# Develop and expose
# I feed upon your every thought
# And so my power grows.
# Protected.  Detective.  Electric eye.
> Judas Priest
# The old man's sitting there, his head bowed down
# Every now and then he'll take a look around
# And his eyes reflect the memory-pain of years gone by
# He can't regain nostalgic dreams he'll never see again
# With trembling hands, he wipes a tear
# Many fall like rain, there's one for every year
# And his life laid out so clearly now, life that's brought death
# So nearly now life once he clung to dearly lets go
# But spare a thought as you pass him by
# Take a closer look and you'll say
# He's our tomorrow, just as much as we are his yesterday
# A lonely grave, and soon forgot
# Only wind and leaves lament his mournful song
# Yet they shout his epitaph out clear
# For anyone who's passing near
# It names the person lying here as you
# And you...and you...and you...
> Judas Priest
# I traveled to a distant shore
# I felt I had to go
# An inner voice had called me there
# But why I did not know
# I saw the evening star rise up
# Shining out to sea
# And now I understand at last what it means
# What it all means
# Evening star I can see the light
# Evening star guiding me so bright
# I used to tempt fate
# I couldn't see straight
# I faltered through my younger days
# Never knowing where I was going
# Then something helped me penetrate the haze
# Evening star I can see the light
# Evening star guiding me so bright
# Now I am stronger
# The haze no longer
# Ruins my future destiny
# Such inspirations and new sensations
# Pull up these string ties chasing me
# Evening star I can see the light
# Evening star guiding me so bright
# I'm home once more, much better for
# The things that I have found
# Much wiser now, so simple how
# Each time I turn around
# I see the evening star rise up
# Shining out on me
# And now I understand at last what it means
# What it all means
# Evening star I can see the light
# Evening star guiding me so bright
> Judas Priest
# We turn and face each other / My fingers pull your hair
# You wince and jerk my wrist off / I bite my lip and stare
# Your stance at once defiant / I'm rigid to your pose
# You clench your teeth in anger / My loving swells and grows
# You give me evil fantasies
# I wanna get inside your mind
# Come on and live my fantasies
# I'll show you evil you can't hide
# You're dragged into my vision / Trapped, serving to my need
# Maybe imagination / Is where my dark side feeds
# You slide your nails down in me / I raise my structure high
# You pout, I snarl, you whimper / And wave compassion by
# You give me evil fantasies
# I wanna get inside your mind
# Come on and live my fantasies
# I'll show you evil you can't hide
# Gonna take you, gotta get through
# Gonna make you, do what I want
# You're dragged into my vision / Trapped, serving to my need

# I'd spend my days alone
# I used to stay at home
# Lost in seclusion there.
# Like I was in a cell
# A captured heart as well
# Surrounded by despair.
# Darkness filled my soul
# Losing all control.
# Down on the streets below
# Bright city lights would glow.
# The energy would rise
# And through the heat I'd gaze
# Still counting empty days.
# With fire in my eyes
# Living through this hell
# Can I break this spell.
# Fever.  You set my soul on fire.
# Fever.  You fill me with desire.
# Fever.  You always get it right.
# Fever.  All day and all night.
# Then one night as I walked
# I heard your body talk
# I saw a shooting star.
# In some magnetic trance
# Our beating hearts would dance
# And crash down from afar.
# Oh how strange fate is
# Never dreamed of this.
# So destiny has brought us
# Oh so close together
# We were like angels in the night
# Living the dream
# At last I'll be with you forever.
# And all at once it feels so right.

# I heard a human voice who sang like no one else
# I heard a proud lady singing loud
# Lived her life as she liked, didn't give a damn
# But soon she found she was underground and wasted
# I watched her hitting notes as she strutted stage
# Her body shook oh, she did her stuff
# She screamed and quake, give and take, maybe took too much
# If you take the smooth you gotta take the rough
# Why do you have to die to be a hero
# It's a shame a legend begins at its end
# Why do you have to die if you're a hero
# When there's still so many things to say unsaid
# I heard a man's guitar electrify a crowd
# I felt the sound shower 'round
# And he would take you with him where no music's been before
# As you merged the power surge together
# His music knew no limits if you were in it's wake
# You had no choice, no, but hear its voice
# And you would listen hypnotized, and in a dream
# But once so strong survive or become weak
# Why do you have to die to be a hero
# It's a shame a legend begins at its end
# Why do you have to die if you're a hero
# When there's still so many things to say unsaid
# If you gaze across timeless years you'll find them always there
# And many gods will join the list compiled with dying care
# Hungry mouths are waiting to bite the hand that feeds
# And so the living dead carry on immortal deeds
# I saw on silver screen an actor's rise to fame
# But fast car user lose
# That legend's born from death and that is such a shame

# I came across a smoking field, pulsating afterglow

# Deadly as the viper
# Peering form its coil
# The poison there is coming to the boil
# Ticking like a time bomb
# The fuse is running short
# on the verge of snapping if it's caught
# And all the pressure that's been building up
# For all the years it bore the load
# The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
# Ready to explode
# Jawbreaker
# Crouching in the corner
# Wound up as a spring
# Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
# Muscles are all contorted
# Claws dug in the dirt
# Every ounce of fiber on alert
> Judas Priest
# I never give no answers, I never tell no lies
# I never walk a straight line so I never get surprised
# I don't ask no favors so I won't get abused
# I learned to win when I was young
# So I'm never ever gonna lose
# They pay me the money and I'll do the job
# I got a contract on you
# I got a contract, on you
# I never ask no questions, I never speak my mind
# I always found that silence helps to keep me and my kind alive
# I take care of business, It takes care of me
# I look after myself and do it well
# 'cause somebody's always looking for me
# They pay me the money and I'll do the job
# I got a contract on you
# I got a contract on you
# What manner of man am I?
# A gun, lump sum and then I move on
# What manner of man are you?
# Stab a friend's back to jump a queue
# I do what I do 'cos I can't do nothing better
# You do what you do, just defendin' yourself
# 'cos you ain't got nothin' better to do
# I got no place, no name, I'm just a killing machine
# I kept the population down, if you know what I mean
# I never stop in one place, I move about the cities
# Got expensive tastes, but I hasten to add that
# I'm the best that there is
# They pay me the money and I'll do the job
# I got a contract on you
# I got a contract on you
# I got a contract on you

# Throughout the soft and timeless days of August
# 'Til now the shadows begin to grow much longer
# The sunset's fire has deepened blood red
# I give you this, the last rose of summer
# A token of my unyielding love
# So when the winter's mantle stills the earth
# And all around seems dead and cold
# This rose reminds you of a time when all was warm and living
# Do not despair, mother nature simply rests
# In sleep she has well earned
# 'Til one day not so very far from now
# With the opening of the first rose buds I shall return
# A token of my unyielding love
# So that when winter's mettle steals the earth
# And all around seems dead and cold
# This rose reminds you of a time when all was warm and living
# The last rose of summer
# The last rose of summer
# In your long shadows
# The last rose of summer
# In the sunset
# The last rose of summer
# Take this rose that I give you
# The last rose of summer
# The last rose of summer
# Don't worry about the winter
# The last rose of summer
# I shall return
# The last rose of summer
# The last rose of summer

# Where do we go from here
# There must be something near
# Changing you, changing me forever
# Places changes, faces change
# Life is so very strange
# Changing time, changing rhyme together
# There's no where else to go
# This could be our last show
# Changing dreams, changing schemes never
# We are never satisfied
# Love is gone, along with fun
# Now we're reaching for the gun
# Changing cast, changing fast, no more tether
# We are never satisfied

# In the last rays of the setting sun
# And the past days, that's where our

# And all of those times
# Still race through my mind
# I'm shattered inside to find
# When the night comes down
# And I'm here all alone
# When the night comes down
# And there's no place to go
# Call me and I'll wait till the summer
# You never understood
# Call me and I'll wait forever
# For a love that's only good
# As the light starts to dim
# The fear closes in
# And the nightmares begin
# Oh no you won't be there tomorrow
# Oh no say it isn't true
# Can't take this pain and sorrow
# Oh can't you see my heart is broken in two

# Where would you be without music

# Can you imagine the silence
# Not even the pink or white noise
# Well thankfully we've got the license
# To have us some fun with the boys
# One for the road, sharing
# our load, show us the way
# The melody line's fascinating
# The rhythm is something divine

# I made a spike about nine o'clock on a Saturday
# All eyes hit me as I walked into the door
# Then ??? and then the guys were fooling in the demin dudes
# A couple cards played rough stuff, New York, fire island
# I cased the joint, straining at the scenes
# I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin'
# I snapped the smile off his face and scowled "Give me a bourbon"
# The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting
# All the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action
# The scene screwed me up, I saw some contact
# Then the big boys, saw me and knew that
# I'd had too much, floating around
# Statues alive, seconds are hours
# Sacks like a hurricane, wrapped in and shattered
# I was barely holding on to this flying body symphony
# I guess I dream in pictures, not colors

# Rent the silent air
# Amidst the dying bodies

# Well let us serenade the sinner, we'll follow in his step.

# The fury songs, venomous wrongs so rich in tragedy,
# An overture forever more to senseless victories.
# Give to us this day of glory the power and the kill
# So we avoid the wrath and all the almighty fire of
# White heat, red hot burns deep, white heat red hot.
# The heat's hot burns a lot.
# Who are not cut out to fight this day will surely fall.
# The few who stand to take command forever and ever are men.
# Prepare to fight, unsheathe your scythe a ghastly beam of ill
# To slice the life with blinding light and seventh dimensional skill.
# The centuries of dedication inherited till at last
# From years of solar gladiation can only end in
# White heat, red hot burns deep, white heat red hot.
# The heat's hot burns a lot.
# Who are not cut out to fight this day will surely fall.

# And the winter it gets stronger
# Got to ease my aching head
# In the morning when I wake up
# Get this feeling deep inside

# Bows and flows of angel hair and ice cream castles in the air
# And feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way
# But now they only block the sun they rain and snow on everyone
# So many things I would have done, but clouds got in my way
# I've looked at clouds from both sides now
# From up and down and still somehow
# It's cloud's illusions I recall
# I really don't know clouds at all
# Moons and Junes and ferris wheels the dizzy dancing way you feel
# As every fairy tale comes real, I've looked at love that way
# But now it's just another show, you leave 'em laughin when you go
# And if you care don't let them know, don't give yourself away
# I've looked at love from both sides now
# From give and take and still somehow
# It's love's illusions I recall
# I really don't know love at all
# Tears and fears and feeling proud, to say, "I love you" right out loud
# Dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way
# But now old friends are acting strange they shake their heads, they say
# I've changed
# But something's lost but something's gained in living every day
# I've looked at life from both sides now
# From win and lose and still somehow
# It's life's illusions I recall
# I really don't know life at all

# Where troubles melt like lemon drops

# Why then, oh why can't I?
# If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
# Why, oh why can't I?

# ČE JE TO SLOVO
# (Zmagovalka slovenske popevke)
# Na tleh leži tvoj kovček siv v njem stvari
# Na mizi ključ na licu smeh a v srcu greh
# Nek tuj poljub in moč obljub izdaja te
# Kot črn sneg med nama je ujet
# Na tleh leži moj kovček siv v njem stvari
# Res moje roke umazane so od strasti
# In na ves glas ti rečem daj oprosti mi
# Res žal mi je prekrižaj me
# --REFREN--
# Če je to slovo me močno objemi stisni me,
# Da mi lažje bo
# Če ti je hudo ti moj zrak zajemi,preden greš
# Ker te minute sreče vse bolj branijo,se upirajo
# A ljudje takoj obsojamo
# Je res tako težko oprostiti če res ljubimo
# Trdna tla iskrenosti vsak izgubi
# In kdaj pa kdaj v svojih sanjah odleti
# Le kdo sem jaz da lahko zdaj sodim ti
# Je poraz odpuščati

# Black* numerous times at start and behind the beat
# To tell the truth man. Shit, we all grew up in the ghetto
# Young black males, huh. Those black girls, hide and go get it
# It was real in the hood. Niggaz kept it real. I mean, they did
# It was only black. That's all we knew, shit. Ain't a damn thing change
# Nigga proud to be one. Put that on anything
# [Verse 1]
# Don't make me have to get the black gloves and black ski mask
# Anything a nigga have to do to get me cash
# You know I wear a lot of blue
# 'Cause that's just what a nigga do
# Tonight I got on so much *black* I look invisible
# They say that all black man are criminals, dead orin jail
# Well, I'm an angry, young, black individual
# My daddy born *black*, my momma born *black*
# Daddy was a mack and daddy ain't know how to act
# But daddy had the black Cadillac, he had black slacks
# Driving me to school, I used to toat the black backpack
# And napsack, black raps in my mind I'm hearing it
# I wrote about the only thing I knew, the black experience
# Stick-ball, playing dice by the brick wall
# Say bloody mary three times, that bitch will get yall
# Street fights, being in before the street lights
# Before I ever learned to freak a beat right
# Nigga, I was *black*
# Don't be fuckin round with me 'cause I'll have you seeing *black*
# Trying to get me for the chain, I'll make you faker *black*
# There ain't nothing in my heart or in my soul 'cause it's *black*
# I told you it's *black* 3X
# Now every gram and collar green, nigga that's *black*
# And plastic on a brand new sofa, that's *black*
# Freeze pops, and double dutch and hot chips *black*
# I'm trying to tell you big pimping, that's *black*
# [Verse 2]
# My momma told me, don't be on that
# Terry, don't get sidetracked
# Terry, you was born *black*, and you gon' die *black*
# And you gon' always be black, and you gon' always know *black*
# Even though, you the lightest motherfucker on the Kodak
# But know that you should act black, knowing you should rap at
# Know when to pull it
# And when you should shake hands, and that's that
# She said, you're *black*, so them coppers will harrass you
# And them black choppers see who hiding in the grass too
# She said being black is heaven in hell
# But most black man either end up dead or in jail
# She told me, you don't have to date *black*, and you don't have to marry it
# But never ever hate *black*, be proud of it and carry it
# And even when they put you in the dirt, they'll never burry it
# And don't just have one approach son, you need to varry it
# Before baseball, before basketball
# Even when my casket fall
# A nigga still *black*
# [Verse 3]
# Black way of thinking, I'm done with it, I'm through with it
# Why they call it black male, fuck I have to do with it
# I never knew they'd punk, every black crack one day
# The stock market crashed, and they called it black Monday
# black* kids are ghetto, *black* cats are bad luck
# Wear black at funerals, to me it doesn't add up
# But I don't give a mad fuck, what you try and label me
# I'm one black nigga getting paid from using ABC's
# Black are less intelegent, rap is just irrelevant
# And in most black neighborhoods, crack is just so prevalent
# Disproportionately, I see black put up on death row
# And not the one in Interscope either, where all the rest go
# And it's still Ok to tell a little white lie
# Cops pull over black kids, the black kid, he might die
# But no matter what they say, how we destroy the world
# I love these *black* boys and girls
# A nigga's proud to be *black*

# Juice, yea, Conglomerate

# Juice, stacking his dough like John Prophet
# All this catches, macking these hoes with Peter Loffet
# But we the new rap pack, Conglomerate distributed
# I'm bigger than the industry, you gonna have to live with it
# To capture time is the key
# Component words trapped in my mind so I seize
# The moment, words freeze opponents
# Pre-fees are on it, I'm a cancer
# Can't really think, and no MC's they want it
# That's why they get me like palionthologist
# The word naive backwards is evian, swallow this
# I win battles yo, it's way beyond politics
# I work up through cells like a crazy anthalogist
# In metaphors, I have mine, rap is in my enzymes
# Got a hundred-ten lines, I'm ready to defend mine
# I'm like a broken rubber band, they say that I snap
# But ask the people, they'll tell you it's the way that I rap
# I rap like noone out there could fuck with me
# "With that freestyle, you better get shot"
# I rap like noone out there could fuck with me
# "Your battling is written"
# I rap like noone out there could fuck with me

# I rap like noone out there could fuck with me
# I freestyle erratically, for those that want to battle me
# [Verse 2]
# I spit fire flame, I'll demolish your entire game
# It's like I work for NASA, 'cause I'm just on a higher plane
# This ain't rapping, I'm just hitting you with CHI game
# I get you higher than Richard Prior when the guy came
# My show's traffic, but I ain't Mike Douglas
# When I attack the mic, both black and white love this
# J U, with the brain of ten scholars
# I catch my hoes on the rebound like Ben Wallace
# Intergalactic tactics get pimped
# All I need is a fifth of this yack to get bent
# And some dro when the mack in
# At shows I be snapping, on tracks is Emmaculate
# Hoes, they be clapping, my flow's never lacking
# For those in the back and
# I blow when I rap, you should've known it would happen
# Plus I let it rock like Bobby Brown and Whitney
# I rap like noone out there could fuck with me

# Now with these verses and this herb, I'm like Jackson Hewitt
# I get you green but I add a little taxes to it
# What would the whole world do, if they had to admit
# Juice was just as nasty with the pen and pad when I spit
# So if the freestyles iare real, and the writing is real
# Then who the fuck else is this tight in the IL
# I don't be hating on these CHI cats that moved away
# I just got time invested, so I choose to stay
# Kanye dropped and Twista's my homie G
# And Kan' told me that the next spot belong to me
# I do not wear pink, and I am no Diplomat
# New York niggaz using CHI slang, nigga picture that
# Not signed to Arista, I am no aristocrat
# Blessed with the gift of rap, and nobody could get with that
# Think this shit is split like Timberlake and Britney
# I rap like noone out there could fuck with me

# J flow Y3K, J neo
# Every bar I drop is penetentary steel
# Every car I rock represent me on the real
# It ain't hard to hop in the Bentley's or DeVille's
# No gimmicks, I'm multy, simply through the skill
# J, I distribute my own CD
# Fuck you, this is a tribute to only me
# And my clique nigga, CONGLOMERATE
# You predesigned with it, but I redefine lyrics
# So open up your eyes, read the signs and hear it
# The trey'll leave you niggaz with leaky minds and spirits
# Lay these niggaz flat like matresses

# Better watch me, I'll show you what floss mean
# Or you can get your mouth blown off like soft scheme
# These skills are trinitron, 16's are effortless
# Success we been upon, the hood is still repping us
# You night like dinner time, for anyone approaching us
# Fuckin with the pentagon, you think we just some vocalists
# This is a rap rennaisance, I'm magnificent
# Slugs are past stitches, I'm life's antifisist
# J, got the right man ripping it
# My cD dissappear like Soundscan is sniffing it
# JU, slash ICE period
# Debut, slash rap's 3D lyricist
# Drug supplier, these thugs are liers

# Thug attire, like I'm lapping in the tunnel
# I'm downtown niggaz, six-oh, six-one-oh
# [Chorus 2X]
# [Verse 3]
# If you want a little piece, I'll give you a little piece
# I'll set this motherfucker off like the middle east
# And let it jump, I stay calm as a reverend
# I used to walk through the valley, like son's 27
# The bomb when I step in the club
# Comfy like Saddam with the weapon, it's love
# These niggaz fall down and they never get up
# Nigga, you can't buy a vowel now, the three letters is up
# J, I'm left brain, hard to explain
# I'm worse than 9/11 when the jets came
# worse than John Rocker at Mets games
# Cocking the tek, aim and blast
# Hop in the Lex, range ang gas
# And they wonder why I'm angry at
# These lil' niggaz in the CHI wearing Yankee hats
# You Chicago nigga, you can't be that
# You ain't number one Joe, you ain't T-Mac
# Nigga, don't claim Brooklyn, don't do that
# When you niggaz come home, we don't want you back
# This is 312, all pimps in it
# Fall through, all blue, still creeping it
# CONGLOM, pimps in it, the hood don't get us
# We can't stop crooking, yall fiends won't let us

# Whoever want to step up, he lose catastrophy

# How it plays is, they sleep you with apathy
# NO empithy, I knew these dudes from back in the day
# They want to greet you, get the cap and then spray
# Then, they either leak you with the mack or the trey
# Dudes in the hood like damn, what done happen to J
# So, when they offer to meat you sporadically
# Evaluate the offer then refuse emphatically
# It's all Juice's, he rule dramatically
# When I move, the streets move, you majesty, J

# In the rap game, name me who can rap with me
# Verser are like art, each fueled with capistry
# When I was broke on the street, crews would laugh at me

# Used to have coke on the street, dudes would gas at me
# The thoughts of sane man, hit through insanity
# What the hell happen to we true and family
# They tried to bring they heat through and blast at me
# Disrespect Hertz, I would eat food with chastity
# Pitbull with Anthony, it's deep, it's how it have to be
# Now I smoke with Cheetz do, it baffle me

# Lovers, I know you've had a few
# But hide your heart beneath the covers
# and tell 'em they're the only one
# And others, they know just what I'm going through

# Floating through this darkness
# All alone
# Love is gone in darkness
# Cold as a stone
# Searching through the shadows you have known
# Love's gone
# Bare as a bone.
# Trying to hold the memory face
# You seem to have vanished without a trace
# And in this darkness
# This empty space
# I float alone.
# Now the night is falling
# You have gone
# Sad dreams blow through dark trees
# Love's gone wrong
# Clouds of sadness raining all night long
# Love's gone
# The end of our song.
# I float alone
# I float alone.
> Julee Cruise
# I remember your song
# And the way you sang it to me
# So many times in other forms
# On distant lands.
# I remember your smile
# And the way you sent it to me
# So many times through different air
# It lives inside my heart.
# It is a dream
# You and me
# It can't be real
# I never felt a wind
# So happy, so warm
# That sent seven little red birds up my spine
# Singing...

# Do you remember our picnic lunch?
# We both went up to the lake
# And then we walked among the pines
# The birds sang out a song for us
# We had a fire when we came back
# And your smile was beautiful
# You touched my cheek and you kissed me
# At night we went for a stroll
# The wind blew our hair
# The fire made us warm
# The wind blew the waves
# Out on the lake
# We heard the owl in a nearby tree.
# I thought our love would last forever.
> Julee Cruise
# You made the tears of love
# Flow like they did when I saw
# The dying swan
# The swan that died in darkness
# I want your smile
# I dreamt of your swan smile
# And then wings moved the air
# Water rings widened
# As bells sounded
# In the night.
# Then your smile died
# On the water
# It was only a reflection
# Dying with the swan.

# And I won't forget the men who died
# Who gave that right to me
# And I gladly stand up next to you
# And defend her still today
# 'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
# God Bless the USA
# From the lakes of Minnesota
# To the hills of Tennessee
# Across the plains of Texas
# From sea to shining sea
# From Detroit down to Houston
# And New York to LA

# You stick up for me when I fall hard
# Take down all my fear
# Juggle my thoughts around in my head
# So I won't break down around each bend
# With my foot on the pedal I'll race ahead
# Drive this life with me

# When the clock strikes night and I'm in the dark
# You'll be here and there you are
# When the lines get cut and I feel far
# Reaching out to me
# When I feel like a freak

# When I don't make sence cause I'm this way
# You see the best in me

# Yo, I release agression
# Explode like automic weapon
# Going to deep spells of demonic posession
# Gave the devil my rhyme book, just to read through
# He hid it in a safe that he had swallowed the keys to
# Said:"Jus Allah, I have nothing to teach you"
# There's no plauge or harm to man more deceitfull
# Than a lost breed of evil
# Fucking monsterous niggaz
# Trade to kill inside their subconcious
# Taken what's promised, derived from skies and comets
# Acomplish Prophecies from Muhammed
# I overpower shit, fuck the hater and the doubter shit
# Chop off the top of your skull, drink out of it
# Cowardly bitch I hear death in the wind
# Notify next of kin, best of friends
# You limbs are lobbed off, by Jus Allah's axe
# Forced to whack their own severed arms to catch
> Jus Allah
# [Intro: Jus Allah]
# Yeah son, white devil's been living it up for too long
# It's about time it's over for that, you know I'm sayin?
# I'm their worst fear, the black man, the white nightmare son
# Recognize that, ya know? Get all you fiends taken
# Get all that taken
# [Verse 1: Jus Allah]
# Yo, I was placed on the planet, just to cause problems
# Sperm I spawned from, burnt holes in condoms
# Heaven splits in the presence of excellence
# A force to be reckoned with
# Way too fuckin strong to rely on ya prayers and hopes
# I walk out the jungle in bear-skinned coats
# While you still scared of ghosts we cut throats
# I introduce myself, the God is upmost
# My brain never touched the soap
# Refused to be another fuckin slave that stuffed the boats
# On puffs of smoke, I'm fuckin phenomenal
# What I think is logical, to you is physically impossible
# Take a blood drop from you, copy you
# Just to get your own identical to tell you I'm unstoppable
# Unsurpassable, obstacle, unsolvable
# Math written in my chronicle, astronomical
# Pass me the gun for mans, extinction
# I piss in the fountains of youth, you drink from
# My stomach got young dead orphans in it
# I eat from trash cans at abortion clinics
# [Chorus: Jus Allah]
# I'm a fucking nightmare
# Young black and just don't give a fuck
# I just wanna get high and live it up
# A nightmare
# Young, black and just don't give a fuck
# I just wanna get high.
# A white nightmare
# Young black and just don't give a fuck
# I just wanna get high and live it up
# A nightmare
# Young, black and just don't give a FUCK..nigga
# [Verse 2: Jus Allah]
# I'm the sickest beast walkin, I read in the dark
# And speak, as the deepest thoughts of Steve Hawkins
# Interpret fuckin' dolphins
# Megallah's that martian, disturbin the peace inside coffins
# Even priests caution defyin the science
# Violent niggaz, who carry the iron giants
# No swine diets, the strength of Goliath
# Hope ya last rhyme is good enough to die with
# Against madness, performin' the black magic
# Savage, I steal from the offering basket
# And use it as my loot to buy blunts and sacks with
# I give back by sharin wit the niggaz I rap with
# Elite crooks, even the police be shook
# My crib got dead cops attached to meat hooks
# Disectin 'em, I burn whatever left of 'em
# Yo my neighbor told me that a demon lived next to him
# 'Til I threatened him, "Yo cousin, we strapped"
# All y'all motherfuckers just cover ya cap
# I love black, I wish that I was two shades darker
# We unbreakable, like Hurricane Carla
# [Chorus: Jus Allah]
# I'm a fuckin'white nightmare
# Young black and just don't give a fuck
# I just wanna get high and live it up
# A nightmare
# Young, black and just don't give a fuck
# Wanna get high.
# A white nightmare
# Young black and just don't give a fuck
# Just wanna get high and live it up
# A nightmare
# Young, black and just don't give a FUCK..nigga
# [Verse 3: Jus Allah]
# You surcoming the pain
# You're so dumb! That it numbs your brain at gunflame
# Your head should be hung in shame
# Lynched and maimed, playing with the clinic's insane
# Getting bit, up until the last minute of game
# Fuck the glitter and glit, me and my click, only doin' nigga shit
# Makin'hits, only black people benefit
# Never puttin'on the ??? clever
# I never re-trick, god and devil's blood'll never be mixed
# For as long as I live, and the lifeline that runnin' my kin
# Merchin'minds with the swines forbid
# Never should you testifate
# Your maker has your fate as slashed like a paper bag pick your favorite mask
# Hide your ass like diaper rash
# Blow you in the fucking cypertrash
# Make you take a fuckin'firebath BITCH!
# Speakin' on cassettes, I can teach your pet
# Peakin'death, I could reach you after physical death
# Eatin' your beat flesh entirely
# Torchering the soul of you inside of me
# I am irony
# Like reading a line of diary, the firey
# Only 5 percent of mine admire my entirety
# [Chorus: Jus Allah]
# I'm a fuckin'white nightmare
# Young black and just don't give a fuck
# Just wanna get high and live it up
# A nightmare
# Young, black and just don't give a fuck
# Just Wanna get high.
# A white nightmare
# Young black and just don't give a fuck
# Just wanna get high and live it up

# Young, black and just don't give a FUCK.
# Motherfucking nightmare
# Young black and just don't give a fuck

# Now that it's here
# Let's make it special (I'm here tonight)
# So many thoughts in my mind
# The DJ is playing my favorite song (favorite song)
# Ain't no chaperons (chaperons)
# This could be the night of your dreams
# [Chorus:]
# Only if you give, give your first dance to me
# Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
# I know we gotta do it slowly
# If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)
# I'm gon' cherish every moment
# 'cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
# I couldn't ask for more
# We're rocking back and forth
# Under the disco ball
# We're the only ones on the floor (I'm here tonight)
# So many thoughts in my mind
# The DJ's playing my favorite song (favorite song)
# Now we're all alone (all alone)
# Here's the opportunity
# [Chorus:]
# Only if you give, give your first dance to me
# Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
# I know we gotta do it slowly
# If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)
# I'm gon' cherish every moment
# 'cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
# Everybody says we look cute together
# Let's make this a night the two of us remember
# No teachers around to see us dancing close
# I'm telling you our parents will never know
# Before the lights go up and the music turns off
# That's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
# Your glass slippers in my hand right here
# We'll make it before the clock strikes nine
# If you just give, give your first dance to me
# Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
# But we gotta do it slowly
# If you give (give), give the first dance to me (give the first dance, baby)
# I'm gon' cherish every moment (oh, oh, oh)
# 'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
# [Usher:]
# It's your chance, take her hand
# To the floor, to the floor
# Girl if you see something you like then let him know
# 'Cause you only got one chance
# Your first dance
# So take advantage of the slow jam, yeah, man
# [Justin:]
# If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)
# I'm gon' cherish every moment

# I never thought I could feel this power.
# I never thought that I could feel this free.
# I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower.
# And I'm fast enough to run across the sea.
# And there's just no turning back,
# When your hearts under attack,
# Gonna give everything I have,
# Cause this is my destiny.
# I will never say never! (I will fight)
# I will fight till forever! (make it right)
# Whenever you knock me down,
# I will not stay on the ground.
# Pick it up,
# Pick it up,
# Pick it up,
# Pick it up, up, up,
# And never say never.
# Here we go!
# Guess who?
# JSmith and Jb!
# I gotcha lil bro.

# I can handle him.
# Hold up, aight?
# I can handle him.
# Now he's bigger than me,
# Taller than me.
# And he's older than me,
# And stronger than me.
# And his arms a little bit longer than me.
# But he ain't on a JB song with me!
# I be trying a chill
# They be trying to side with the thrill.
# No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will.
# Like Luke with the force, when push comes to shove.
# Like Cobe with the 4th, ice water with blood.
# I gotta be the best, and yes
# We're the flyest.
# Like David and Goliath,
# I conquered the giant.
# So now I got the world in my hand,
# I was born from two stars
# So the moon's where I land.
# I will never say never! (I will fight)
# I will fight till forever! (make it right)
# Whenever you knock me down,
# I will not stay on the ground.
# Pick it up,
# Pick it up,
# Pick it up,
# Pick it up, up, up,
# And never say never.
# I will never say never! (I will fight)
# I will fight till forever! (make it right)
# Whenever you knock me down,
# I will not stay on the ground.
# Pick it up,
# Pick it up,
# Pick it up,
# Pick it up, up, up,
# And never say never.

# Listen...I'ma hundred percent hussla from my face to my feet
# My lifetime cases the street, my dime places the street
# Until I wake and see another f***in day is relief
# I pray that he keep, I'm scrappin my knees from chasing this cheese
# I had point guard dreams of playin for some team
# Hit the block and made NBA money in one week
# See I hussle in the hood and plus I fly birdies
# And play the tracks out every month so I can ride dirty
# needed someone to manage my money I hired Shelly
# But Shelly started talkin to much so she died early
# They got me loadin up my Benz with my eyes blurry
# I sent the message to the f***er at bout five thirty
# Now if the bi*** aint got my dice for me then I'm sorry
# But i'ma leave everyone who outside bloody
# And then I go in the stash get the coke and the cash
# I'm lettin niggas score it for half, I'm hopein it last
# But still nigga don't, I might have to just go in the lap
# And if its slow in the ass back to the rope and the mask
